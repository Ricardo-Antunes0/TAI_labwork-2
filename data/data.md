# Data

The dataset used in this project can be found in https://huggingface.co/datasets/aadityaubhat/GPT-wiki-intro.  
The dataset consists of human texts from Wikipedia, as well as their corresponding rewrites generated by ChatGPT (GPT-3 model).  
After choosing the dataset, we opted for an approach that splits the dataset into 90% of the data for training (./data/train) and 10% for testing (./data/test).

The Fortnight for Freedom is a campaign aiming to raise awareness of human rights abuses and to promote freedom and democracy.  The Fortnight for Freedom was launched on 10 January 2008 by the European Parliament in response to the worldwide upsurge of protests against human rights abuses. The campaign aims to raise awareness of the systematic violation of human rights and to promote freedom and democracy.  The Fortnight for Freedom has a parallel campaign in 53 countries around the world, organised by local civil society organisations. The main goal of the parallel campaign is to promote the EU-sponsored Fortnight for Freedom as a global platform for human rights discussion and action.

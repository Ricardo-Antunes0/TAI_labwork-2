Godwick is a deserted village in the county of Norfolk. Its location was south of Fakenham between the villages of Tittleshall and Whissonsett. There are over 200 deserted villages in Norfolk, but most sites have been destroyed by ploughing, the pressures of two world wars or other agricultural uses. Only a few still have impressive surface remains. The earthworks at Godwick are well preserved because the site is grazed by sheep and has never been disturbed. Today it is one of the best surviving examples in the county and the only one open to the public. There is agreement between the owner and English Heritage over the opening and the management of the site, which is open between April and September from 9:30 am until dusk. On site there are information panels with displays of aerial photographs, maps and interpretation plans of this lost village. The earthworks are a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It is an offence to disturb the site or use metal detectors without the written permission of English Heritage. Origins Godwick was first settled in the Anglo Saxon period. By the 15th century Godwick was a small village which was a relatively stable community, but was comparatively poor alongside neighbouring settlements. It was in the 15th century that the village declined sharply. A series of bad harvests, and the difficulty of cultivating the heavy boulder clay soil, eventually proved too much for the dwindling population. In 1428 there were under ten households. By 1508 a survey taken showed that of 18 properties on the north side of the main street, 11 were empty and three had no land holdings attached. The same survey showed that a church lay to the south and there was also a watermill with a millpond. By 1595 further decay left Godwick virtually deserted. Its final stages of decay were recorded in an estate map of 1596 when only three or four houses remained and the church tower had collapsed.

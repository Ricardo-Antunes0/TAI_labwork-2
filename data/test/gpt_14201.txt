Ashville is a city in Saint Clair County, Alabama, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 9,653. The population was estimated to be 10,000 in 2016. It is the principal city of the Ashville Micropolitan Statistical Area which includes all of Saint Clair County.  The city was named for Major General Ashby V. Turner, a Confederate general during the American Civil War. The Turner family, who settled in the area around 1819, were one of the earliest settlers in what would become Ashville. The city's early economy was based on cotton cultivation and livestock farming. The railroad arrived in Ashville in 1881, and the city began to grow rapidly as a result. By 1900, Ashville had a population of over 10,000 and it had become an important trade center for cotton production in Alabama.  The Great Depression hit Ashville hard, and by 1940 the city had a population of only 6,000. However, during World War II Ashville grew rapidly as a result of military spending and manufacturing opportunities. The postwar years saw continued growth for the city as it became an important industrial center. In 1970, Ashville became a unified city-county government and it has since grown rapidly into a major metropolitan area. Today, Ashville is a center for commerce, education, healthcare, and entertainment in southeastern Alabama.

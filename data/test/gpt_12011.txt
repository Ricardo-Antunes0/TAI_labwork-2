The Rossington Collins Band was an American rock band that was active from the early 1970s until the mid-1980s. The band consisted of singer Rossington Collins, guitarist and songwriter Gary Rossington, bassist and vocalist Don Brewer, and drummer Joey Kramer.  The band was formed in the early 1970s in Hollywood by Collins and Rossington, who had been working together as members of the backing band for singer/guitarist Roy Orbison. The pair recruited Brewer and Kramer to play bass and drums, respectively, and quickly released their debut album, "Rossington Collins", in 1973. The album was a commercial failure, but the band's second album, "Rossington Collins II", became a hit. The album reached number one on the "Billboard" album chart and spawned the hit singles "Gone Too Far" and "I Can't Quit You Baby". The band's third album, "Burnin' Daylight", also became a hit, reaching number two on the "Billboard" album chart.   The band's popularity waned in the late 1970s, however, and they disbanded in the early 1980s. Collins later resumed his career as a solo artist.

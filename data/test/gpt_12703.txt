The Chatfield Farmstead is a historic farmstead located in the town of Westford, Massachusetts. The earliest portion of the farmstead, dating to the late 17th century, is a well-preserved example of a traditional New England farmstead. The main section of the farmhouse, which was built in the early 19th century, is a three-story wood frame structure with a gable roof. It features a large central chimney and clapboard exterior. The property also includes a number of outbuildings, including a barn, chicken coop, and smokehouse.  The Chatfield Farmstead was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is currently owned and operated as a historic house museum by the Westford Historical Society.

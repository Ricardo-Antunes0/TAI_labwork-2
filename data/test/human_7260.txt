Gary J. Tunnicliffe (born 27 February 1968) is a British special make-up effects designer, writer, and director.  He has performed make-up effects in all the Hellraiser films from Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth to Hellraiser: Hellworld, wrote Hellraiser: Revelations, and wrote and directed Hellraiser: Judgment.  His other make-up credits include Candyman, Wishmaster, the Dracula 2000 series, the Pulse series, and Feast. Career  Tunnicliffe started out performing special make-up effects.  After collaborating with Bob Keen on make-up effects for writer-director Anthony Hickox's Waxwork II: Lost in Time (1992), he joined them again for Hickox's next project, Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth (1992).  Special effects technician Kevin Yagher, when selected to direct Hellraiser: Bloodline (1996), contacted Tunnicliffe to perform the special effects on that film.  Tunnicliffe was surprised Yagher was not performing the effects work himself, but Yagher believed Tunnicliffe's experience with the prior film would be valuable.  Tunnicliffe returned for Scott Derrickson's Hellraiser: Inferno (2000) and Rick Bota's Hellraiser: Hellseeker (2002).  He again collaborated with Bota in the next two sequels, both released in 2005.  In Hellraiser: Deader, he also directed the second unit and had a cameo appearance.  In Hellraiser: Hellworld, Tunnicliffe performed special effects, make-up effects, and collected the Hellraiser memorabilia used in the film.  Tunnicliffe appeared in the film as a Cenobite and, briefly, without make-up near the end.  In Hellraiser: Revelations (2011), he wrote the script for director Víctor García.  He wrote and directed the tenth Hellraiser sequel, Judgment.

Lamplighters Marsh  is a public open space  and local nature reserve near Shirehampton in the city of Bristol, England. It is a narrow strip of land between the railway line which connects Bristol to Avonmouth, and the River Avon. Flora and fauna Lamplighter's Marsh has two main types of vegetation: an area of marsh, which contains a varied plant community, including water parsnip and wild celery, and an area of wasteland which is also botanically notable, with species including narrow-leaved everlasting-pea. The Severn Way footpath and cycleway sits alongside the river, passing through Lamplighter’s Marsh where the path is called the "yellow brick road". Viper’s bugloss, moth mullein and hornet moth are among the scarce and notable species recorded at the site. The presence of the grass sea couch are a sign of the influence of the nearby Severn Estuary. Bee orchids grow in the area of grassland now known as the Daisy Field lying between the railway and the Portway. Local birdwatchers have recorded a number of species including common swift, Eurasian siskin, common redshank, Eurasian curlew, Eurasian sparrowhawk, great cormorant and goldcrest.

North Hsenwi was a Shan state in what is now Burma.  The history of North Hsenwi is largely undocumented, but it is thought to have been founded in the late 12th century. The state was ruled by a hereditary monarchy and consisted of a number of princedoms. By the early 16th century, North Hsenwi had come under the control of the Toungoo Dynasty. In 1527, the state was annexed by Burma's Hanthawaddy Kingdom. North Hsenwi remained an autonomous province of Burma until 1885, when it was annexed into British Burma. In 1937, during the Second World War, North Hsenwi was occupied by the Japanese and subsequently fell to the Allies in 1945. The state was eventually dissolved in 1948 and its territory divided among various Burmese provinces.

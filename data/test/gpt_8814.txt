Scorpion Tales was a British thriller television series that aired on ITV from 1997 to 1998. It was created by Tony Jordan and starred Christopher Eccleston as Dr. John Watson, a down-on-his-luck doctor who becomes a suspect in a series of murders linked to the titular scorpions.  The series was cancelled after only three seasons, despite strong ratings in its first two seasons, due to the show's low budget and the departure of Eccleston as the lead actor.

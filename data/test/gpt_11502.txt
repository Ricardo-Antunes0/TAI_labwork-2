Alick is both a masculine given name and a surname. It is derived from the Gaelic name √Åilleach, meaning "noble." Alick is also a variant of Alexander.   The name has enjoyed modest popularity in the English-speaking world since the 18th century. It was not among the top 1000 names in Britain in 1881, but has since climbed to rank #206 in 2008. Its popularity may be due to its association with Scottish nobility and its similarity to the more commonly known Alexander. Alick was ranked as the 5th most popular male name in Scotland in a survey conducted by Scottish Business magazine in 2010.    variant spellings include Ailick and Ailieck

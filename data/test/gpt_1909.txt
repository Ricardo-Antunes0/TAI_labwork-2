Michel Edouard Brière (October 21, 1949 – February 21, 2008) was a Canadian singer-songwriter, guitarist and producer. He is best known for his work as the frontman of the folk-rock band Rheostatics.  Brière was born in Hull, Quebec. He moved to Toronto in the late 1960s and started playing in various bands before forming Rheostatics with bassist/keyboardist Dave Hamelin and drummer Pat MacEachern in 1976. The band quickly became popular in Canada, and released several albums over the next few years. Brière's songwriting skills were showcased on their most successful album, The Rheostatics (1978), which spawned the hits "Tangled Up In Blue" and "The Horses".  In 1983, Brière left Rheostatics to focus on his solo career. He released two albums during this time, both of which achieved modest success. He returned to Rheostatics in 1988, and has since continued to release albums and tour regularly. In 2003, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. Brière died of leukemia at the age of 60.

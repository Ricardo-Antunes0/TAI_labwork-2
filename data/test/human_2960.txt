Sir Kenneth Gilmour Younger KBE (15 December 1908 â€“ 19 May 1976) was a British Labour politician and barrister who served in junior government posts during the Attlee government and was an opposition spokesman under Hugh Gaitskell but retired from Parliament early, disillusioned by party politics. Family Younger was the son of James Younger, 2nd Viscount Younger of Leckie and as such came from an upper-class background atypical of the Labour movement (he was also the brother of Conservative peer Edward Younger, 3rd Viscount Younger of Leckie and the uncle of future Conservative cabinet minister George Younger, 4th Viscount Younger of Leckie). The family lived at Gargunnock in Stirlingshire. After Winchester College and New College, Oxford, Younger read for the Bar and was called (Inner Temple) in 1932. Two years later he married Elizabeth Stewart. They had two daughters and one son (Sam, who became a BBC executive, and is now Chief Executive of the Charity Commission).

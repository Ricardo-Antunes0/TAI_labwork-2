Vaginal flora, vaginal microbiota or vaginal microbiome refers to the diverse microbial population that lives in the vagina. The microbiota of the vagina can be different in each woman, and can change throughout a woman's life.  The composition of the vaginal microbiota has been shown to be associated with health outcomes, including sexual function, reproductive health, and cancer risk. There is growing interest in understanding the role of the vaginal microbiota in women's health, and in developing treatments for conditions such as vaginitis and sexually transmitted infections.

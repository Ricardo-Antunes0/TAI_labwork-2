Kim S. Pegula (n√©e Kerr; born June 7, 1969) is an American businesswoman and, along with her husband Terry Pegula, one of the principal owners of the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League. She is also the president of Pegula Sports and Entertainment, the holding company that manages the Bills as well as the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League, Buffalo Bandits and Rochester Knighthawks of the National Lacrosse League, Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League, LECOM Harborcenter and Black River Entertainment, an independent record label based in Nashville, Tennessee. She is by extension president of the various teams under Pegula Sports and Entertainment, including the Bills and Sabres. Pegula, Shahid Khan and Zygi Wilf are the only three NFL team owners who were not born in the United States. Early life Pegula was born in Seoul, South Korea. She has no recollection of her birth name, no record of her biological parents nor any account of her life in South Korea, only her date of birth, a secondhand account of being abandoned in the streets of Seoul at the age of five, and a DNA test that showed that one of her parents was likely Japanese. She was brought to the United States and was adopted by Ralph and Marilyn Kerr on December 30, 1974. She grew up with her adopted family in Fairport, New York, a suburb of Rochester. Pegula participated in cheerleading and the school band, playing bassoon. After following her brothers' footsteps in enrolling at Houghton College, she and a roommate made plans to venture to Alaska to work near a fishing camp upon hearing there was money to be made. Unable to afford the fare, she applied for work at a restaurant in Olean, New York; while interviewing for a waitressing gig, she met Terry Pegula, who was dining at the restaurant. In 1991, Terry offered her a job at his natural gas company, and they eventually entered a relationship, marrying in 1993.

Antonina Hoffmann (16 June 1842 â€“ 16 March 1912) was a Jewish Austrian artist and sculptor.  Born in Vienna, Hoffmann was the daughter of a rabbinical scholar and teacher, and learned to paint and sculpt from her father. Her early work was in the Academic style of the time, but she soon began to experiment with new styles, developing a unique form of realism. She became known for her portraits and busts, as well as for her sculptures of animals and plants. Hoffmann also worked in stained glass, designing several windows for the Wiener Neustadt synagogue.  Hoffmann died in 1912 in Vienna, at the age of 74. She is buried in the Zentralfriedhof.

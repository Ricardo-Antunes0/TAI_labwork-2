Fourteen ships and a shore establishment of some two thousand men were required to man and operate this unique vessel. The design of HMS Raven was unique, as it was one of the few warships in service at the time that was not based on a traditional sailing vessel. HMS Raven was instead based on a steam-powered ship.  The steam engine allowed for greater speed and range than traditional sailing vessels, making it an ideal choice for patrolling British waters. The vessel was also designed with an armament that could both defend against enemies and carry out raids. The ship's design would ultimately lead to its downfall, as it was quickly rendered obsolete by new technology.

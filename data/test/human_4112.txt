Cystidicoloides tenuissima is a species of nematodes in the order Spirurida and family Cystidicolidae. It is a parasite of salmonid fish (salmon, trout and their allies) in the northern hemisphere and has mayflies as the alternate host. Ecology Adult Cystidicoloides tenuissima are found in the stomachs of salmonid fish. The fish, mostly trout and juvenile salmon, acquire the worms by feeding on infected mayflies which are the alternate hosts of the parasite. In the River Swincombe in England, the only mayfly in which the parasite develops is the sepia dun (Leptophlebia marginata). In Czechoslovakia, nymphs of Ephemera danica, Habrophlebia lauta and Habrophlebiodes modesta were found to be capable of transmitting infection, and the larvae were found to be able to survive into the winged adult mayfly stage. When the stone loach (Barbatula barbatula), a fish in the family Balitoridae, was experimentally infected, the nematodes did not develop beyond the fourth larval stage.

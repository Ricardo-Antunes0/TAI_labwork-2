Conradson carbon residue, commonly known as "Concarbon" or "CCR", is a type of carbon residue that is created when burning coal. It consists of tiny pieces of coal that have not been burned all the way to the ash, and is usually black in colour. Conradson carbon residue is most commonly used in the manufacturing of various products, such as textiles, plastics, and other materials.

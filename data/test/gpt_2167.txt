The Bavarian Class R 3/3 of the Deutsche Reichsbahn was a class of steam locomotives operated in the German railway system.  The locomotives were designed by Wilhelm Maybach and built from 1913 to 1925 by the Bavarian State Railways (Bayerische Staatsbahnen, BS). They were the last class of mainline steam locomotives built in Germany.  The Class R 3/3 was a tank locomotive with a 2-6-2 wheel arrangement, powered by two coal-fired cylinders with a total output of 550 hp. The locomotives were capable of running at speeds up to 130 km/h.  The Class R 3/3 was originally intended for freight service on the Bavarian railway system, but they were also used on passenger trains in the 1930s. After World War II, the locomotives were retired from service and scrapped.

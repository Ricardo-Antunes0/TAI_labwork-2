The Tariqa Burhāniyya ( Ṭarīqa al burhāniyya) is a Sufi tariqa founded by the Islamic prophet Muhammad ﷺ in the 7th century. It is one of the most widespread Sufi orders, with adherents in North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and South Asia.  The Burhāniyya order is named after its founder, Burhān al-Dīn al-Shīrāzī (d. 748/1348), who was born near Merv in Khorasan. He is generally considered to have been the founder of the order, although other sources state that Mawlānā Jalāluddīn Rumi (d. 1273) was its true founder. The order spread rapidly throughout the Islamic world during its early years and had a significant influence on later Sufi orders.  The Burhāniyya order is characterized by a number of distinctive practices and principles. These include a focus on the spiritual journey rather than on mystical experiences or asceticism, a commitment to social justice, and a reliance on direct spiritual experience rather than on theological doctrine. The order has also been known for its emphasis on love and compassion, which it believes will lead to spiritual realization.

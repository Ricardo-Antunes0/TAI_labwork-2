Hazarewal (Plural; Hazarewals, alternatively spelled as Hazara) is a term used to describe the Hazara people who inhabit central and southern Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Hazara are the second largest Shia Muslim group in the world, after the Shias of Iran.  The Hazara people reside primarily in the Hazarajat mountainous region of central and southern Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan, where they make up around 20% of the population. They are also found in sizeable numbers in cities such as Quetta, Peshawar, and Karachi. The Hazara are generally concentrated in urban areas, with their rural hinterlands constituting mostly valleys and highlands.  Hazara culture is diverse, with features that have been largely influenced by their location and interaction with other groups. The Hazaras are noted for their music, dance, craftsmanship, and architecture. They are also well-known for their resistance to forced assimilation into dominant cultures, which has resulted in a unique form of social organization and identity.

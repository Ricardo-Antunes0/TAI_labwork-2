There have been two baronetcies created for the family name MacLeod, both of which are extinct. The first creation was in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 26 October 1831 for Donald MacLeod, the son of Dugald MacLeod, 8th Laird of Lochbuie. The title became extinct on his death in 1851. The second creation was in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 5 January 1902 for Roderick MacLeod, the grandson of Donald MacLeod. The title became extinct on his death in 1932.  The MacLeods are a Scottish family descended from the ancient Lords of Lochbuie. The family first came to prominence during the reign of James VI and I, when Sir Donald MacLeod served as a Lord-in-Waiting to the King. Sir Donald's son, Dugald, became the 8th Laird of Lochbuie and subsequently one of Scotland's leading landowners. He served as Lord-Lieutenant of Inverness-shire and as a Member of Parliament for Inverness-shire and Nairnshire. His son Roderick succeeded him as Laird of Lochbuie and also served as MP for Inverness-shire and Nairnshire. The MacLeods were also notable for their involvement in shipping and shipping interests.

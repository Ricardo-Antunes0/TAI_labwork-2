In materials science and solid mechanics, Poisson's ratio is a ratio of the surface area of a body divided by its volume. The SI unit for Poisson's ratio is the square meter per kilogram. It is also known as the surface area to volume ratio, or surface area to weight ratio.  Poisson's ratio is important in materials science and solid mechanics because it affects the strength and elasticity of materials. It also affects how gases diffuse through solids. Poisson's ratio is often used in engineering to optimize designs for materials and structures.

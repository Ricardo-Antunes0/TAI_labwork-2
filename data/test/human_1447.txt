Shooter is an American drama television series based on the 2007 film of the same name and the 1993 novel Point of Impact by Stephen Hunter. The show stars Ryan Phillippe in the lead role of Bob Lee Swagger, a retired U.S. Marine Corps sniper living in seclusion who is coaxed back into action after learning of a plot to kill the President. USA Network picked up the pilot in August 2015 and ordered the series in February 2016. The series was originally set to premiere on July 19, 2016, but it was postponed to July 26 due to the July 7 Dallas police officer shootings. USA pulled it entirely after the Baton Rouge police officer shootings on July 17. On October 3, 2016, USA announced that the new premiere date for Shooter would be November 15, 2016. On December 19, 2016, the series was renewed for a second season that premiered on July 18, 2017. On December 4, 2017, the series was renewed for a third season.

Albert Bridge is a road bridge over the River Thames in west London. It connects Chelsea on the north bank with Battersea on the south bank and is named after the Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, husband of Queen Victoria.  Albert Bridge was designed by George Edmund Street and built between 1859 and 1864. It is a cast iron bridge with a total length of 5,600 feet (1,700 m), including the approaches, and a width of 95 feet (29 m). The central arch is 210 feet (64 m) wide and has a height of 73 feet (22 m). The bridge has five arches, each 27 feet (8.2 m) wide.   The bridge was opened on 12 December 1859 by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who drove a carriage across it. It was refurbished between 1984 and 1986 at a cost of Â£4 million.

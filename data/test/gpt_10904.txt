Pensamiento Serpentino (Serpentine Thought) is a poem written by the Italian Romantic writer, poet and philosopher Giuseppe Mazzini in 1831.  The poem is written in the form of a dialogue between two serpents. The first serpent argues that mortals are slaves to their passions and emotions, while the second serpent counters that mortals can achieve greatness through their convictions and thoughts.   The poem has been interpreted as a critique of the French Revolution, which Mazzini saw as a misguided attempt to liberate humanity from its bondage to tradition and custom.

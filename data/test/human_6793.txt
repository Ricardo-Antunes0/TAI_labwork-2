Mirkovich's academic success in the sciences was noticed by a superior who advised Mirkovich to enter the Nicholas General Staff Academy after graduation. He graduated from the Page Corps on 17 June 1854 with the rank of cornet in the Life Guard Horse Regiment. He was set on applying to the prestigious Military Topographic mapping department at the General Staff Academy, but in 1854 the Crimean War was in its ninth month and there were no admissions to the department; it seems admissions would only take place after the war was over.

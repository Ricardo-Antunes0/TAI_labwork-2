Ruswarp village lies within the Scarborough borough of North Yorkshire, England, about 2 miles north of Scarborough town centre. The population of Ruswarp at the 2011 Census was included in the civil parish of Knaresborough with a population of 3,224.  Ruswarp is first mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book as Rouswarp. The name possibly derives from a Scandinavian word for 'coastal clearing'. The village has been a settlement since Saxon times and was originally located on the north bank of the River Derwent. It was moved to its current location on the south bank in 1824.  In 1803 Ruswarp became part of the East Riding of Yorkshire. The village has always been agricultural and today most of the land is used for farming. There are a few small businesses within the village and Ruswarp has a primary school, post office and church.

The Haida are one of the indigenous peoples of the Queen Charlotte Islands, located in the North Pacific Ocean. They are a subgroup of the Tlingit people and speak a Haida language. The Haida are also known as the Heiltsuk.   The Haida are one of the most northerly groups of Native Americans in North America and their mythology reflects this isolation from other cultures. Their pantheon of gods and goddesses is rich and varied, with stories about creation, hunting, navigation and trade. The Haida have a long history of artistic expression, with carved masks, totem poles and pottery depicting their stories and beliefs.

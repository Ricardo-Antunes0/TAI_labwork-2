Dominik Paris (born 14 April 1989) is an Italian  alpine ski racer, who specializes in speed events of downhill and super-G. He was the world champion in super-G, as the gold medalist in 2019 at Åre, Sweden. Racing career Paris made his World Cup debut in December 2008 and won his first World Cup race in late December 2012 in Italy, a dead-heat tie with Hannes Reichelt in the downhill on the Pista Stelvio at Bormio. Aksel Lund Svindal was just one hundredth of a second behind for third and Klaus Kröll was fourth, just one hundredth behind Svindal. It was the closest top-four finish in World Cup downhill history (0.02 of a second) and the first tie in a men's downhill in nearly 35 years (January 1978). Four weeks later, Paris firmly established himself as a top downhill racer on the circuit with a win at Kitzbühel on the classic Streif course.

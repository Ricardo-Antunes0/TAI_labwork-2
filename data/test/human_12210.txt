Best Air was an airline of Bangladesh with both domestic and international destination, a subsidiary of Best Aviation. The company was formed in 2007 as a joint venture between Best Aviation and a Kuwait-based company, Aqeeq Aviation Holding which controls a 70% share of the airline. It started operations in January 2008 from Dhaka's Shahjalal International Airport. Best Air suspended its operations in 2009, due to extraordinarily high fuel costs. Best Air had announced that they have received a large investment from Destiny Group LTD of Bangladesh and will restart operations on 26 March 2011, but did not. They intended to re-enter the domestic market with three brand new ATR 72 aircraft. Plans called for the acquisition of three A320 aircraft later in the year, followed by the A330 or B777 for long haul routes in the near future. There was also an airline in the U.S. operating scheduled passenger jet service during the 1980s which used the name Best Airlines.

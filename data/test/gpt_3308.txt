Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with the study of ways to make combinations of objects.  Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of combinations, including both finite and infinite combinations. Mathematical combinatorics is founded on the theory of probability, and its methods are often applied to problems in mathematics, computer science, and other sciences.

Religious Liberty was commissioned by B'nai B'rith and dedicated "to the people of the United States" as an expression of support for the Constitutional guarantee of religious freedom. It was created by Moses Jacob Ezekiel, a B'nai B'rith member and the first American Jewish sculptor to gain international prominence. The statue was  high, of marble, and the plinth (base) added another . It weighed , and was said to be the largest sculpture created in the 19th century. It was carved in Italy and shipped to Fairmount Park in Philadelphia for the nation's 1876 Centennial Exposition. It was later moved to Independence Mall and now (2019) stands in front of the National Museum of American Jewish History. The meaning of the sculpture It comprises four figures, the principal one representing the Goddess of Liberty, dressed in coat of mail and a mantle, with a shield, having the American flag in relief on her breast. The Phrygian cap on he[r] head is bordered in front with thirteen stars of solid gold. Her right hand rests upon the fasces, the scroll of the constitution and wreath of laurel; her left is extended in gesture, waving off all interference. Under her protecting right arm stands Faith, symbolized by a nude boy, whose head and right hand are raised appealingly to heaven, and whose left hand holds close to Liberty's breast a vessel in which is burning the undying flame of Religion. At the feet of the Goddess, on her left, is Intolerance, represented by a monstrous serpent, part of the body of which is coiled around the fasces, while its head protrudes with gaping jaws from under the garment of Liberty. With outstretched wings, fierce bearing and its talons buried in the neck of the serpent, is the American eagle.

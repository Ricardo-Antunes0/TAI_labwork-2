Oph 162225-240515, often abbreviated Oph 1622, and also known as Oph 1622-24, is a comet that was discovered by a team of astronomers led by Dr. David Jewitt on November 25, 2004. The comet has been observed by many astronomers since its discovery, and is currently estimated to be about 1.3 kilometers in diameter. It is currently in the constellation Ophiuchus. The comet is expected to pass close to the sun on March 29, 2019, and may become a visible object to the naked eye.   The comet was first observed by a team of astronomers led by Dr. David Jewitt on November 25, 2004. The comet had been previously observed by astronomers from the Palomar Observatory in California, but had not been detected until Jewitt's team used a new instrument called the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRS) on the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) telescope. The PTF is a special type of telescope that is designed to study comets and other transient astronomical objects.   Since its discovery, the comet has been observed by many astronomers. The current estimate of its size is 1.3 kilometers in diameter. It is expected to pass close to the sun on March 29, 2019, and may become visible to the naked eye if it is bright enough at that time.

Johannes Cornelisz. Verspronck (between 1600 and 1603 â€“ 30 June 1662 (buried)) was a Dutch Golden Age portrait painter from Haarlem. Life  Johannes Cornelisz. Verspronck was born between 1600 and 1603 in Haarlem as the son of the painter Cornelis Engelsz from Gouda, who taught him to paint. In 1632 he became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke and started a successful career as a portraitist of mostly Catholic sitters in Haarlem. He may have been a Frans Hals pupil, and was strongly influenced by him, especially in his natural expressions and relaxed poses. He is best known for his exactness in painting details such as jewelry and lace, which made him quite popular with female sitters. Most notably, he won a lucrative commission in 1642 for a group portrait of the regentesses of the Heilige Geesthuis, at the time one of the wealthiest charity institutions in Haarlem, situated on the Krocht. This was won at the expense of Frans Hals himself, who had painted the regents of the St. Elisabeth Gasthuis in 1641 and fully expected to win the commission for the women. Twenty years later Verspronck even painted the regentesses of the St. Elisabeth Gasthuis.

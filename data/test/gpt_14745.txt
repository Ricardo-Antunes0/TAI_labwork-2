Nomeansno (sometimes stylized as NoMeansNo or spelled NoMeansNah) is an American punk rock band from Albuquerque, New Mexico, formed in 1991. The band's name is derived from the acronym "NOM", which stands for "No One Likes Me".  Nomeansno was one of the earliest punk bands to emerge from the Albuquerque area, and their 1991 debut album, Isolationism, helped to establish the city as a center for the punk movement. The band has since released six more albums, the most recent of which, We Are The Lost Boys (2009), was their first release in thirteen years. In addition to their own recordings, Nomeansno has collaborated extensively with other artists, most notably on the 2003 album World Peace Is None Of Your Business.  Nomeansno has toured extensively throughout North America and Europe, and has played at several major music festivals, including Lollapalooza and Ozzfest. In 2006, they were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album for their self-titled album.

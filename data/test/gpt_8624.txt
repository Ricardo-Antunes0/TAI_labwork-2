Marley Station Mall is an enclosed shopping mall in Marley Station, Pennsylvania. Opened on February 15, 1984, it is the largest shopping mall in the Lehigh Valley region. It features more than 120 stores and restaurants, a 12-screen movie theater, a skating rink, and a 18-hole miniature golf course.  The mall was built on the site of the former Marley Station Mall, which opened in 1962 and was Pennsylvania's largest shopping mall at the time. The original Marley Station Mall was destroyed by a fire on December 15, 1981. The new mall was built by the same company that built the original mall.  The Marley Station Mall is owned by Taubman Centers Inc., which also owns the nearby Lehigh Valley Mall in Bethlehem, the Powell Park Mall in Allentown, and the Whitehall Mall in Whitehall Township.

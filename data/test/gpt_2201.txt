A monastery is  a building or complex of buildings used by members of a religious order, especially monks, nuns, and friars, in their religious practices.  The word "monastery" derives from the Latin monasterium, which derives from the Greek monasterion, meaning "a place of retirement", or "a hermitage". In modern usage, the term generally refers to any establishment of monks or nuns, whether or not it is an actual building.   A monastery can be an isolated building or part of a larger community. A complex consisting of several buildings may be called a convent, while a single building that houses both men and women may be called a nunnery. In ancient times, a monastery was typically an isolated building with a single monk or nun living and working there. The Rule of Saint Benedict mandated that every monastery have a garden and orchard.   The monastic life is one of self-denial and austerity. Most medieval monasteries were closed off from the world and their members led simple lives, working on religious texts or providing manual labor in the grounds. However, there are many exceptions to this rule. For example, Cluny Abbey in France was one of the most powerful and wealthy institutions in Europe for centuries, while Mount Athos in Greece is internationally renowned for its rich culture and history.

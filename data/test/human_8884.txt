In Others' Words is a compilation album, and the second covers album by American country music artist Dwight Yoakam. It was released on September 23, 2003 on Reprise Records and peaked at number 59 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. Recording Yoakam enjoyed a successful commercial run with Reprise from 1986 to 1993, but by 2000 the hits dried up and he left for Warner Bros.  To fulfill his contract, Reprise gathered recordings from various soundtracks and tribute albums from the 1990s to piece together In Others’ Words, a sequel of sorts to Yoakam’s 1997 Under the Covers LP.  “Holding Things Together,” for example, is from the Merle Haggard tribute album Tulare Dust, while “Truckin’,” appears on the Grateful Dead project Deadicated.  “Cattle Call” can be found on the soundtrack to The Horse Whisperer, while "T For Texas (Blue Yodel No. 1)" previously appeared as a hidden track at the end of Under the Covers.

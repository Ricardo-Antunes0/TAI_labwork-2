The Visakhapatnam gas leak, also referred to as the Vizag gas leak, is a natural gas leak that occurred on 25 September 2013 in Visakhapatnam, India. It is the largest gas leak in India and the third-largest in the world, after the 2009 LPG gas leak and the 2010 BP oil spill. The leak occurred from a pipeline belonging to the Indian state-owned fuel retailer Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL). The leak was first detected on 23 September 2013 and continued for over two weeks until it was finally stopped on 7 October 2013. As of July 2017, 540 million cubic meters (18.7 trillion cubic feet) of natural gas had been released from the pipeline, enough to supply around 120,000 homes for a year.

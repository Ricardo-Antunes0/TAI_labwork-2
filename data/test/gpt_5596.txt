Operation Amanda was a United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) peacekeeping operation in Croatia that began on 20 April 1992 and ended on 15 December 1993.   The objectives of the operation were to protect civilians and help the return of refugees and displaced persons, to establish and maintain law and order, and to facilitate the implementation of the Peace Agreement of Zagreb. The operation was named after Amanda Lindhout, a Canadian citizen who was kidnapped in Somalia in August 1991 and subsequently held hostage by the rebels for twenty-three months.

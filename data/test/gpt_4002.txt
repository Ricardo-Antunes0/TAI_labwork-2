Counterproductive norms can be defined as group norms that prevent people from reaching their full potential. They can be harmful because they lead to inflexible thinking and behavior, reduce the efficiency of social interactions, and inhibit creativity.  There are many types of counterproductive norms, but some of the most common are those that constrain individuals' ability to take risks, think independently, or express themselves freely. These norms can limit an individual's opportunities to learn and grow, and can even harm the group as a whole.

By speaking out against them and encouraging others to do the same, we can help create a more productive society where everyone is able to reach their full potential.

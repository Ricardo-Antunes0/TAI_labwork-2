Lady Elizabeth "Betty" Germain (1680 â€“ December 1702) was an English aristocrat and poet. Born into an ancient and prestigious Suffolk family, she married the future 3rd Duke of Montagu in 1698 and became one of the most celebrated ladies in England. She died in childbirth, leaving behind a son who would later succeed to the dukedom.  Elizabeth Germain was born in 1680, the eldest daughter of Sir John Germain (1638-1715), a prominent lawyer and politician who sat in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and his wife Lady Frances Osborne (1653-1740). She was baptised at Bradfield Hall on 9 January 1680.  Betty Germain married the future 3rd Duke of Montagu on 2 May 1698 at Whitehall Palace. The couple had two children:   On 6 February 1702, Elizabeth Germain died at Whitehall Palace after a long and painful labour. She was only 25 years old. Her husband later wrote: "She died as she had lived, with fortitude and serenity; a Virgin to the last."   Elizabeth Germain remains one of England's most celebrated poets, her poetry praised by both John Dryden and Alexander Pope. Her most famous work is her elegy, "To His Coy Mistress," which is often seen as a precursor to William Blake's poetry.

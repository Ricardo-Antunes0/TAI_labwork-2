Humpday is a 2009 American comedy-drama film directed, produced, and written by Lynn Shelton and starring Mark Duplass, Joshua Leonard, and Alycia Delmore. It premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. International distribution rights were purchased by Magnolia Pictures for a mid-six figure sum. The film opened in New York City on a limited released on July 10, 2009. Much of the dialogue for the film was improvised. Plot Two heterosexual male friends Ben (Duplass) and Andrew (Leonard) meet after having not seen each other for 10 years. During a party, they find themselves locked in a "mutual dare" situation engaging to make a gay pornographic film, including anal sex, as an "art project" between two straight guys and submit it to the HUMP! film festival. They do not decide yet who will penetrate whom. Ben tells Andrew that he will discuss the project with his wife Anna (Delmore). As Ben begins to describe the project to Anna, she reacts skeptically at the mere mention of amateur pornography. Ben finds himself lying to Anna; he talks about the project with only vague detail, telling her that he will likely act as a behind-the-scenes assistant to the hypothetical film crew.

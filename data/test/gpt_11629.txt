Nicaraguan exceptionalism (Spanish: Excepcionalismo Nicaragüense) is a term used to describe the unique political, economic, and social conditions that have characterized Nicaragua since the late 19th century. These conditions include a long history of stability and democracy not found in other Central American countries, as well as a large and prosperous middle class that has contributed to the country's development.  Nicaragua has been an independent country since 1821, and during its history it has been ruled by a variety of different political systems. After the overthrow of Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle in 1979, Nicaragua underwent a period of reconstruction and liberalization, culminating in its return to democracy in 1990. Since then, it has been dominated by the left-leaning Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), which has held power since 1990.  The FSLN has been characterized by its support for social welfare programs and its commitment to democratic principles, which have made it relatively popular with the Nicaraguan population. However, its decision to remain in power through violent means has led to accusations of corruption and human rights abuses. In 2018, the FSLN lost elections to the conservative National Alliance (ANAP), which saw the entrance of Juan Orlando Hernández as president.

The Squire Earick House is the oldest known brick house in the city of Baltimore, Maryland. The property was purchased by Antoine de La Motte in 1692, and he began construction of the house on it in 1694. The property was acquired by William Earick in 1729, and he added the current stone facade to the house in 1738. The Earick House is a three-story Georgian-style brick building with a hipped roof. It has a gabled central section flanked by two end sections. The facade features a pedimented entrance, bracketed cornices, and Federal style window shutters.   The Squire Earick House was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966.

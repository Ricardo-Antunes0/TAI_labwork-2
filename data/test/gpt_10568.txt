The Brass Lantern is a traveling trophy between Cumberlands and Union football teams. It is a replica of the 1892 Cumberland County Courthouse lamp that served as the game ball. The trophy's namesake comes from a 1909 Cumberland victory over Union at the old Recreation Park in Carlisle.  The rivalry between the Cumberlands and Union football teams is one of the most longstanding in college football. The teams first met in 1888 and have met every year since, with the exception of 1943 due to World War II. The rivalry is one of the few that has played annually since its inception. The two schools are located in neighboring counties in eastern Kentucky, and their football programs are both Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).  The rivalry is often close and competitive, with the last six games having been decided by a touchdown or less. The last time the two teams met was in the 2016 NCAA Division I FCS Championship Game, which Cumberlands won 42-38.

The group consisted of a rotating company of children, aged 8 to 16, who have performed in at least one Broadway, Off-Broadway or major national touring production. They performed concerts singing showtunes from various musicals, appearing at special events such as Broadway on Broadway, and have recorded five Broadway-centric CDs, one Christmas CD, and two Pop-centric CDs.

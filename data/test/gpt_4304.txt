Bomberman: Act Zero is an action video game developed and published by Hudson Soft for the Nintendo GameCube. It is the tenth installment in the Bomberman series and the first game in the series to be released on a home console since Bomberman 64 in 2001.  The game was announced during Nintendo's E3 2003 press conference and was released in Japan on November 14, 2003 and in North America on March 16, 2004. It was also released in Europe on April 1, 2004.  Bomberman: Act Zero is a singleplayer action game that revolves around the player controlling Bomberman as he moves through a series of levels, destroying enemies and obstacles while avoiding being hit by bombs dropped by enemies or objects. The player can select from one of four characters to play as, each with their own abilities: Bomber Man (the titular Bomberman), Chain Man, Turbo Man and Fire Man.  Between levels, the player can explore various locations, such as a haunted house or an amusement park, where they can find power-ups and other items that can be used in later levels. The game also features online multiplayer for up to four players, as well as a boss battle mode that allows the player to fight against giant bosses from previous Bomberman games.  Bomberman: Act Zero received mixed reviews from critics. While many praised its presentation and gameplay design, others found it repetitious and criticized its short length. Despite this, it has been praised for reintroducing some fan-favorite elements of the series

Delamain is a producer of  cognac, based in Jarnac, France. Delamain was founded in 1759, when James Delamain came back from Ireland to form a partnership with his father-in-law, Jean-Isaac Ranson, owner of a long-standing exporting firm whose origins date back to the very first beginnings of cognac. James married Jean-Isaac Ranson's daughter Marie Ranson on 24 November 1762. After his death in May 1800, the firm fell apart. In 1924 his grandsons, Anne-Phililippe Delamain and his cousins of the Roullet family re-established the name Roullet & Delamain as a producer of cognac.

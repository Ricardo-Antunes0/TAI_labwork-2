The Whitewater River is a  tributary of the Upper Mississippi River which flows through the Driftless Area of Minnesota, reaching its mouth in Wabasha County at the community of Weaver opposite Buffalo, Wisconsin. The nearest towns are Altura, Saint Charles, and Elba. The region hosts endangered native dry oak savannas, semiforested areas that seem to have been dependent on fire for their well-being. The main stem of the Whitewater River is formed by the confluence of the North Fork Whitewater River and Middle Fork Whitewater River at Elba, and is joined by the South Fork Whitewater River, just downstream. The North Fork flows through Wabasha, Olmsted, and Winona counties, with a "channel length of 47 km" (c. 30 miles). The upper branches of the Whitewater River system including the portion that flows through Whitewater State Park are designated trout streams. Native brook, wild brown and occasionally stocked rainbow trout populate the streams.

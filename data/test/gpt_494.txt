Kundirana is a high-school Music Ministry. Its vision is to equip students with the tools to worship God musically and lead meaningful lives through music.  Kundirana was founded in the fall of 2006 by a group of music enthusiasts with the intent of providing a high-quality music program for students in the area. The ministry currently operates three campuses: a primary campus in downtown Indianapolis, an intermediate campus in Carmel, and a secondary campus in Fishers.  Kundirana offers classes in music theory, music history, ear training, choir, piano, guitar, and drums. In addition to its academic programming, Kundirana also offers enrichment opportunities such as concerts and tours. The ministry also offers summer camps for students in grades 6-12.  Kundirana is committed to creating a positive environment where students can develop their musical skills and ministry skills. The ministry strives to instill character development through music while providing opportunities to give back to the community.

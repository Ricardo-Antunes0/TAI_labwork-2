Donald Richard Gibb (born August 4, 1954) is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. Gibb rose to prominence as a member of the Bee Gees, one of the most successful and commercially successful pop groups of all time. The group achieved worldwide fame in the late 1960s and early 1970s with their signature hits "How Deep Is Your Love" (1967), "Staying Alive" (1977), "Massachusetts" (1978), and "Holiday" (1978). Gibb's career slowed down in the late 1970s, but he later recovered and had several successful collaborations throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 2009, Gibb was made a Knight Bachelor by Queen Elizabeth II for services to music.

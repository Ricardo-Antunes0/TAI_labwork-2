Laoennea renouardi is one of two species in the genus Laoennea of the Asian terrestrial snail family Diapheridae (Stylommatophora, Streptaxoidea). Description The tiny shell has a height of 1.8 mm and a width of 1 mm. The white, glossy, transparent shell is compact and less elongated with fewer whorls compared to Laoennea carychioides. The apical part of the shell is dome-shaped. The conical-ovate shell possesses five convex whorls, which are separated by a deep suture. The next-to-last whorl is expanded and broader than the last whorl. The protoconch is not clearly discernible. The teleoconch shows streaks of uneven growth lines. The last whorl shows widely spaced ribs and radial striations. The opening (aperture) is heart-shaped, which is reinforced by a thick callus. The apertural dentition consists of two well-formed denticles, one on the palatal wall and the other one (parietal lamella) on the parietal wall, forming a round sinulus. The sinulus is in line with the rest of the aperture. Additionally, a low, weak columellar denticle is located close to the peristome.  The peristome is expanded and slightly reflected. The shell has a straight central column (columella) and the umbilicus is visible as a small slit.

The Nemesis is a Lotus Exige modified sports car that was produced by Lotus Cars from 2003 to 2006. It was based on the Elise chassis and powered by a supercharged engine.  The Nemesis was designed to rival the Ferrari 360 and McLaren F1, and it featured a number of cutting-edge technologies, such as a carbon fiber body, carbon ceramic brakes, a racing suspension, and an all-wheel drive system. However, despite its impressive specifications, the Nemesis was not a sales success, and it was discontinued after just four years in production.

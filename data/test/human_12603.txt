The Orphaned Starfish Foundation (OSF) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization focused on developing vocational centers for orphans, victims of abuse and at-risk youth. Through the creation of computer centers and a focus on the development of computer literacy, OSF creates increased employment opportunities for the children they serve. It runs fifty computer centers in twenty-five countries, serving over 10,000 children worldwide. History  OSF was founded by Andy Stein, a philanthropist with a background in international banking. While working as the joint head of corporate finance in the Philippines for Chase Bank, Stein became 'financially and emotionally' connected to working with orphans and orphanages. He insisted any clients who wanted to pitch business must also arrange a visit to an orphanage. In Chile, Stein spoke with a nun, who informed him of the challenges that face orphans after leaving the orphanage, including homelessness, drug addiction and prostitution. This inspired him to file the necessary paperwork to create a charity, and raise funds for a state-of-the-art computer center for the orphanage in Santiago.

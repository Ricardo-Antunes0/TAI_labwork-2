The Wiesbaden manifesto is a document written by the philosopher Martin Heidegger in April 1946, just after World War II in Germany had ended.  The manifesto is a call "to be born again" and "to think anew". The manifesto calls for a fundamental reconsideration of the nature of Being, time, and being-in-the-world.

Dichomeris ligyra is a species of moth in the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Meyrick in 1913. It is found in Australia, where it has been recorded from New South Wales.  The wingspan is about 14Â mm. The forewings are light ochreous-yellow, somewhat sprinkled with darker yellowish-ochreous, the costal edge blackish. There is a rather broad darker yellowish-ochreous fascia from three-fourths of the costa to the dorsum before the middle, edged posteriorly by a narrow fascia of blackish suffusion. There is a small blackish dot on the costal edge at two-thirds and a larger one beyond it on the dorsum at four-fifths, as well as a smaller black spot on the costa before the apex. The hindwings are pale whitish-grey.

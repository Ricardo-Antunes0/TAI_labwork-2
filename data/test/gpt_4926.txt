The Lebanese Arab Army – LAA (Arabic: الجيش اللبناني العربي‎ al-Jaysh al-Labanani al-Arabī) is the main military branch of the Lebanese Armed Forces. The LAA is a conscription army, and its ranks are based on social status and not on ethnicity or religion.   The LAA has played a significant role in Lebanese history, primarily during the Lebanese Civil War. It has been involved in almost every phase of the conflict, from fighting rebels in the south to stabilizing the country during the 2005 Cedar Revolution. The LAA is also responsible for defending Lebanon's borders against external threats.

The Carbine affair, also known as the Tenerife shooting, was a terrorist attack on the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands on 25 May 1977.  The attack, which killed five people, was carried out by the Marxistâ€“Leninist Group for the Liberation of Palestine (GLP), also known as the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The GLP was a terrorist organization with links to the Soviet Union and China, and it was responsible for a number of attacks in Europe and North America during the 1970s.  The Carbine affair is notable for its use of firearms, which is unusual for a PLO attack. The GLP believed that firearms would increase the chances of success for their mission. The attack also demonstrated the GLP's ability to deploy sophisticated tactics and weaponry, which made them a threat to security and stability in Europe and North America.

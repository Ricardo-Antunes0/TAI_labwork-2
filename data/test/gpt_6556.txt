Heavy bombers are bomber aircraft capable of carrying a large payload over long distances. They are typically very large aircraft, with a maximum payload capacity of around 10,000 kg (22,000 lb), and a range of up to 5,000 km (3,100 mi).  Heavy bombers were first developed in the early days of aviation as a means of delivering large amounts of bombs over long distances. Their increased payload capacity and range made them ideal for bombing strategic targets such as factories, oil refineries, and other important targets in enemy territory.  Today, heavy bombers are still used by many militaries around the world to carry out bombing raids. They are particularly popular with countries such as the United States and Russia, who use them to attack targets in enemy territory.

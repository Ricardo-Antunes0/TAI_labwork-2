CFPL is a radio station owned by Corus Entertainment and based in London, Ontario, Canada. Transmitter power is 10,000 watts daytime, 5,000 watts nighttime. Broadcast frequency is 980 AM. CFPL uses a four-tower directional antenna with differing patterns during the day and night. The station primarily airs news, and talk programming, as well as London Knights hockey and Toronto Blue Jays games. The studios are located in downtown London, while its transmitter is located south of London at Wellington Road and Scotland Drive. History Originally CJGC, the station first went on the air at approximately 698 kHz, at a time when wavelength was usually used rather than frequency. It later changed to 910 kHz, then, to avoid interference from a Mexican station at 909, moved to 595 kHz, which it maintained until it merged with CKOK Windsor to become CKLW in April 1933. During the 1920s and early 1930s, CJGC airtime was used from time to time by CNRL, a phantom station of the Canadian National Railways.

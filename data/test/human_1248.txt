Whacked! is a party video game developed by Presto Studios and released in 2002 by Microsoft Game Studios exclusively for the Xbox. It is a gameshow in which contestants compete for the Prize, whatever they wish, by hitting each other with objects such as missiles, hammers and pitchforks. Whacked! was the last game developed by the now defunct Presto Studios. Gameplay There are 8 playable characters and a wide variety of levels which are unlocked throughout the game. The game's levels are usually absurd or surreal, such as the back of a pickup truck involved in a police chase, up in space, on top of city buildings, under a Christmas tree, in the Arctic pipeline, at the scene of a car crash, on the roof of "Club Ba√±o" (literally meaning "Club Bathroom" in Spanish), on a toy pirate ship floating in a bathtub of electrified water, and a kitchen sink; which is a reference to the colloquialism "Everything but the kitchen sink".

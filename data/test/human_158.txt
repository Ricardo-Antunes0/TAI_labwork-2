Kevin J. Boyle (born February 7, 1980) is a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and current minority Chairman of the PA House State Government Committee. He is the state Representative from Pennsylvania House District 172, which covers parts of Northeast Philadelphia. Boyle was elected to the House of Representatives in November 2010 when he ran against 32-year incumbent and former Speaker of the Pennsylvania House John Perzel. Boyle is the younger brother of United States Representative Brendan F. Boyle and together they are the only set of brothers to serve simultaneously in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives in its 300-year history. Early life Boyle is the son of Francis Boyle, an Irish immigrant who came to America at age 19, and Eileen Boyle, a first generation Irish American who worked as a school crossing guard. He grew up in a row home in the Olney section of Philadelphia, where he was raised by his pro-union working-class parents. He graduated from Cardinal Dougherty High School   in 1998 and graduated with honors from LaSalle University in 2002, where he received his B.A. in Political Science. He went on to earn a master's degree Harvard University. While at Harvard University where he earned his master's degree in Education, Boyle researched urban education issues, school funding streams, and strategies to expand access to higher education. Much of his research was included in the "Reach Scholarship" bill that his brother, Rep. Brendan Boyle, and then-Rep. Tony Payton introduced in the House in 2009. The goal of the legislation was to provide all Pennsylvania students who demonstrate academic excellence with the opportunity to attend college for free.

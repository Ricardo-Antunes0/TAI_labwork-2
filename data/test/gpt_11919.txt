Bargrennan chambered cairns are a class of megalithic tomb in Scotland, consisting of small chambers usually built of large boulders and usually covering a single burial.  The name is derived from the Scottish Gaelic word "barga" meaning an enclosure or a small fort.   Bargrennan chambered cairns are found in Perth and Kinross, and the largest concentration is in Glen Urquhart. They were probably built between 4000 and 2000 BC, and are thought to have been used as ceremonial sites or tombs for high-ranking individuals.

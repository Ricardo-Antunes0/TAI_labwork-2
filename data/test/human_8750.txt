Prime Supermarket (Chinese:百美超级市场) is a family owned supermarket chain in Singapore. It is under the parent company Prime Group International, which has overseas ventures in the agriculture and hospitality industry. There are currently 25 outlets island-wide that are generally found within the neighbourhood housing estates, some of which are open 24 hours a day. History Prime Supermarket was established in 1984 by Mr Tan Hong Khoon, after his fathers' pig farming business which was inherited from the elder Mr Tan's father, was forced by the government to shut down due to redevelopment plans in the Punggol area. The first grocery store was thus established as an alternative business venture in King George's Avenue. In the following years, the business was then grown and expanded into the supermarket chain that is as seen today, with their own house-brand products being sold too. Prime Group International was also subsequently established for local and overseas ventures, of which in 2016, the Mahota Commune houses were established, which is a mixed retail business that included a supermarket as well. In a nod to the healthy lifestyle that the government has been actively trying to promote, the supermarket has also ensured the overall wellness of its staff by encouraging and promoting healthy living. The original supermarket in King George's Avenue also continues to stand till this day.

Amyloids are aggregates of proteins characterised by their propensity to form insoluble fibrils. They are found in a wide variety of tissues and organs, including the brain, heart, blood vessels, and muscles. Amyloids are implicated in a number of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

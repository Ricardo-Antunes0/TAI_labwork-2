The Pedrocchi Café (Caffè Pedrocchi in italian) is a historic café in Rome, Italy. It is located on via Veneto, just off the Piazza Navona, and is known for its pastries.  The café was founded in 1754 by Pietro and Francesco Pedrocchi, who were originally from Florence. The brothers had married in Rome and set up shop on the then new street of via Veneto. The café soon became popular with the Roman aristocracy and became known for its pastries, including the world-famous cannoli. Pietro and Francesco Pedrocchi retired in 1814, leaving their son Giovanni to run the business. Giovanni continued to run the café until his death in 1865.   Since 1865, the café has been owned and operated by the Pedrocchi family. Today, it remains one of Rome's most popular tourist destinations and is a popular place for people to enjoy a cup of coffee or a pastry.

Hydrogen storage is a term used for any technology or process that can store hydrogen in an environmentally friendly manner. Hydrogen storage can be divided into two categories: ambient storage and renewable storage. Ambient storage refers to any method of storing hydrogen that does not require a dedicated facility. Renewable storage refers to any method of storing hydrogen that can be recovered and reused.   Hydrogen is a clean fuel with the potential to play a major role in the future of energy. It has the potential to replace gasoline, diesel, and other fuel sources. However, it has a low energy density, making it difficult to store and transport. Hydrogen storage technologies aim to improve these characteristics in order to make hydrogen more viable as a fuel source.  There are several different types of hydrogen storage technologies. In ambient storage, hydrogen is stored in an environment where it is not used or consumed. This could be in the form of gas, liquids, or solids. In renewable storage, hydrogen is stored and used again soon after being created. This could be in the form of gas, liquids, or solids.

Elvis M. Grbac (born August 13, 1970) is a former American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons, most notably with the Kansas City Chiefs. He spent his first four seasons as Steve Young's backup on the San Francisco 49ers, who selected him in the eighth round in the 1993 NFL Draft. Grbac landed his first starting position in 1997 with the Chiefs, where he played his next four seasons. On the Chiefs, Grbac would help lead the team to two playoff berths and one division title, along with earning Pro Bowl honors in 2000. However, his tenure would also be noted for a quarterback controversy with Rich Gannon during the 1997 season. The Chiefs' decision to start Grbac over Gannon drew retrospective criticism due to Gannon having greater success on the rival Oakland Raiders. Grbac played his final season for the Baltimore Ravens. After retiring, he became the head football coach and athletic director at Villa Angela-St. Joseph High School, the high school he attended as a student.

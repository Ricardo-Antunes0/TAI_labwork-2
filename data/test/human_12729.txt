The FPV F6 is an automobile that was produced in Australia by Ford Performance Vehicles from 2004 until 2014. It is a high-performance derivative of the Australian Ford Falcon. The F6 is based on the modern-classic Ford Falcon XR6 Turbo sports sedan. The F6 engine is based on XR6T motor, a turbocharged intercooled DOHC 4.0L Inline Six with VCT, but includes: a modified FPV airbox (with Dual Ram Air intakes), higher strength conrods, larger air-to-air intercooler, high flow exhaust system, higher capacity fuel pump, and a Garrett GT3582r (same as the BA/BF XR6T) turbocharger with an internal waste gate (up from the GT3576r on the FG XR6T) running 0.64 bar of boost on the BA/BF models and 0.91 on the FG. This engine is known for its wide, flat torque curve, with peak torque of  available from 1950 to 5250 rpm (FG F6). This equates to strong acceleration throughout the rev range.

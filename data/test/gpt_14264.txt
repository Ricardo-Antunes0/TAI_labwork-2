Thomas John Ypsilantis (; June 24, 1928 â€“ October 11, 1978) was an American politician who served as the 38th Mayor of Detroit from 1973 to 1978.  Born in Detroit, Michigan to Greek immigrant parents, Ypsilantis attended Cass Technical High School and earned a degree in political science from Wayne State University. He began his political career as a city councilman, serving from 1963 to 1967. In 1969, he was elected mayor of Detroit on a progressive platform, and he served until his death in 1978. During his tenure, Ypsilantis made Detroit a more affordable city for middle-class families and improved the city's infrastructure. He also made Detroit a center of the American punk rock movement, and his policies helped spur the city's economic resurgence in the late 1970s. Ypsilantis was posthumously inducted into the National Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.

The Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex , also known as the Central Andes Volcanic Belt , is a large volcanically active area located in central Chile and extending into Argentina. The highest peak in the area is Aconcagua at 6,962 metres (22,839 ft).   The Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex is one of the most active volcanic regions on the planet. It has more than 150 active volcanoes, including more than 50 that are currently considered to be active. The region has seen more than 1,700 eruptions since the beginning of recorded history, making it one of the most prolific volcanic areas on Earth. The majority of these eruptions have been small, but a few have been large and destructive. The most notable eruption in the region was the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, which killed over 80 people and caused $2 billion in damage.   The Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex is also home to some of Chile's most spectacular mountain ranges. These ranges include the Andes, the Coastal Range, and the Chilean Central Valley. The Andes are one of the world's highest mountain ranges and are home to some of Chile's most famous peaks, including Aconcagua, Mount Tupungato, and Mount Illimani. The Coastal Range is a series of rugged mountains that run parallel to the Pacific Ocean coastline and are home to some of Chile's most spectacular scenery.

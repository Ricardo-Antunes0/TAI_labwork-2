Leonard Lanzi (born 1962) is a former executive with the Los Padres Council of the Boy Scouts of America known for his high-profile dismissal from the organization because he came out as a gay man. He is the subject of the short documentary film Scout's Oath. Lanzi has been a candidate for public office and a successful venture capitalist. Lanzi is an active Rotarian and is active in the LGBT community. Life Lanzi was born in Warwick, Rhode Island. He became an Eagle Scout, and is a graduate of the University of Rochester. Up to 2000, he had spent his entire professional life working as a Scout Executive with the Boy Scouts of America, first in the San Francisco Bay Area and then San Diego, before moving to Santa Barbara. He was fired after coming out as gay in a public speech to the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors. On October 17, 2000, when speaking against a Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors proposal to remove funding from the Scouts because the organization excludes gays, he said, "I am gay". Lanzi disclosed this because he felt obliged to follow his Scout's honor and tell the truth. Said Lanzi, "A Scout has to have integrity... and I could not speak up here without feeling hypocritical." He then embraced the twelve attributes of the Scout Law: "I am trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent."

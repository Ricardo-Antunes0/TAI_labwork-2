Albert Gladstone Trotter, better known as Uncle Albert, was an English composer, conductor, and music teacher.  Born in London on 10 October 1861, Albert Trotter was the son of a successful music publisher and pianist. He began his musical training at the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied composition with Arthur Sullivan and conducting with Hans Richter. In 1886, he won the prestigious Mendelssohn Scholarship to study at the Leipzig Conservatory, where he met and befriended Johannes Brahms.  After completing his studies in Leipzig, Trotter became a leading music teacher in England. He served as the director of the Royal Academy of Music from 1899 to 1904 and as the Dean of the Royal College of Music from 1904 to 1910. In 1912, he was appointed Master of the Queen's Musick and held that position until his death in 1918.  Uncle Albert is best known for his compositions for orchestra and chamber music, which are characterized by their Romanticism and classical form. His most popular works include the orchestral suites The Planets (1894) and The Flowers of England (1907), the string quartet in G major (1898), and the piano triptych The Dream of Gerontius (1917). He also wrote a number of solo pieces, including the violin sonata in A major (1892), the Second Piano Concerto (1910), and the Prelude No. 1 in C-sharp minor (1911).

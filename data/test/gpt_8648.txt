In philatelic terminology a letter sheet, often simply called a sheet, is a printout or facsimile of a letter, usually on paper, but sometimes on other media. They date back to the 16th century and were used by philatelists to study and copy the original letter.  A letter sheet can be used for a number of purposes, including studying the layout of a letter and its compositional elements, identifying postage stamps and other postal markings, and verifying the authenticity of a document. They can also be used as reference material for philatelic research.  Today, letter sheets are often digital facsimiles that are made available online or in printed form.

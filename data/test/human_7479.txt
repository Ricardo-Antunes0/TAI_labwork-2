Gameplay The player is tasked with driving an anti-radiation vaccine through a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The game centres around destroying other cars that attempt to stop the player and avoiding obstacles. The game has 32 levels, each of which has a password meaning that progress could be saved. Depending on how quickly each level is finished, a number of onlookers at the end of each level will explode due to the late arrival of the vaccine. Various power-ups may be collected in each level, including additional weapons, deployable oil-slicks, nitro speed-boosts, and 'death crystals' which make the player's car immune to crash-damage when colliding with other cars. Money earned in each level can be spent on repairs and upgrades.

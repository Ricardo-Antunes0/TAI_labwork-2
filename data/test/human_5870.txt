Madam Garsa Fwip is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise in the Disney+ television series The Book of Boba Fett. She is of the Twi'lek species and is first introduced in "Chapter 1: Stranger in a Strange Land" as the owner of the cantina The Sanctuary. She brings her tribute and loyalty to Boba Fett by filling his helmet with gold. When Krrsantan is fighting the Trandoshans she tries to calm him, but fails. She is later killed after the Pykes blow up The Sanctuary while she is inside. Fwip is different from the usual Twi'lek as most female Twi'leks are enslaved, while she is a wealthy owner of a cantina. Garsa Fwip is portrayed by Jennifer Beals, who helped costume designer Shawna Trpcic come up with ideas for Fwip's design. Beals also did not know what show she was part of, but knew it had something to do with Star Wars. Fwip has received generally positive reviews from critics. Some critics even thought that Fwip was going to be the main villain of the series.

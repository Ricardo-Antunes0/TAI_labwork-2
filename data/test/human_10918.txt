Irina Stolyarova (Russian: Ирина Столярова; born 14 February 1966 in Moscow) is an art collector, nonconformist movement expert, art director of Flying in the Wake of Light collection. Her collection is focused on the work of Russian artists of several generations, living both in the home country and in the West; and the first émigrés generation associated with the School of Paris. Career Stolyarova's collection, Flying in the Wake of Light, collected during the last decade, and not all the Russian artists included are products of Soviet soil. Many are émigrés or children of émigrés, like the formidable Pierre Dmitrienko (1925–1974), with a biographical background that is more Montparnasse than Arbat. Yet the animating genius of the whole is nonetheless a distinctly Russian spirit that, as the Evangelist said, bloweth where it listeth, evidently, even in the desolation of the Soviet epoch. That cogency of purpose is what makes this private collection remarkable; indeed, this is what makes it a private art collection – in the same qualitative, if not quantitative, sense as those built by the Fricks and the Mellons of yesteryear – rather than a selection of pictures decorating the walls of a private house.

The Local Bubble, or Local Cavity, is a phenomenon that occurs when the economy of a particular region or country begins to outperform that of other regions or countries. The Local Bubble is often followed by a burst, during which the region or country's economy falls behind those of other regions or countries.  The Local Bubble can be caused by a number of factors, including strong economic growth, low interest rates, and favourable investment conditions. When the bubble bursts, this can lead to a recession or financial crisis in the region or country, as well as increased unemployment and poverty.

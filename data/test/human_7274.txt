American country music singer and songwriter Kenny Chesney has released nineteen studio albums (including a Christmas album), two live albums, two greatest hits albums, and 70 singles (counting "The Tin Man", which was released twice). Ten of his albums consecutively reached number one on the US Billboard Top Country Albums chart. Fourteen of them have been certified gold or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). His highest-certified albums are No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems (2002), When the Sun Goes Down (2004), and his first Greatest Hits compilation, each certified 4× Platinum for shipping four million copies in the US. Excluding his 1994 debut In My Wildest Dreams on Capricorn Records, all of his albums have been issued by BNA Records. Of Chesney's seventy singles, all but four have charted in the Top 40 on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay chart. Thirty of his singles have reached number one, beginning with "She's Got It All" in 1997. "The Good Stuff" (2002) and "There Goes My Life" (2003–04) are his longest-lasting number ones on the charts at seven weeks each. The former was also the number one Hot Country Song of 2002 according to the Billboard Year-End charts. All but two of his singles from the mid-1998 "That's Why I'm Here" onwards have charted on the Billboard Hot 100 as well, with twenty-six of his singles peaking inside the Top 40. "Out Last Night" (2009) is his highest peak on that chart at number 16.

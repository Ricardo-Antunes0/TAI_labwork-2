Genocide Superstars (often referred to as or simply GS) is an international documentary film crew that travels to countries in turmoil to document the atrocities of genocide. The film crew has traveled to Cambodia, Darfur, Rwanda, and Srebrenica; each time witnessing the aftermath of a genocide.  The documentary film crew has been criticized by some for glamorizing genocide and making it seem like a fun experience. However, others argue that GS is essential in raising awareness and educating people about genocide so that it may never happen again.

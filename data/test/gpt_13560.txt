The Campeonato Nacional de Liga de Primera División, commonly known as La Liga or La Liga Santander, is the top professional football division of Spain. It was founded on 28 October 1928 by Antonio Fernández Ruiz, a businessman from Tarragona. It is one of the most popular football leagues in the world with an average attendance of 26,000 spectators.  The league has 72 clubs, with each club playing each other twice, once at their home stadium and once away. Teams are ranked by points earned over the course of the season. At the end of the season, the club with the most points is crowned champion. If two or more clubs are equal on points after all ties have been resolved, then their position in the table is determined by their head-to-head record. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy equal positions based on their performance in European competitions over the past five seasons. If there is still a tie, teams are determined by their performance in La Liga matches over the past two seasons.  The first Spanish national championship was contested in 1928. The competition was won by Barcelona who beat Racing Club de Santander 4–1 in a play-off final. Barcelona retained the title the following year and went on to win five more championships. Real Madrid were also successful during this period, winning three championships between 1933 and 1936. However, they would not win another title until 1956. During this time Atlético Madrid, Valencia and Zaragoza emerged as contenders

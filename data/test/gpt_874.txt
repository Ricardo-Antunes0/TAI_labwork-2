Bengalis (singular Bengali  ), also rendered as Bengalee, is one of the major linguistic groups of the Indo-Aryan family. They are native to the region that is now Bengal in eastern India. Bengalis share a common linguistic heritage and culture with other Indo-Aryan speakers, including the Punjabis, Marathis, and Odias.  Bengalis are the descendants of early Indo-Aryan settlers who migrated from present-day north-western India into eastern Bengal region in the Middle Ages. Bengali is the official language of Bangladesh, where it is spoken by a majority of the population. There are also significant Bengali populations in India, especially in Assam, West Bengal, and Tripura. The Bengali language has a rich literature and culture.  The official census figures show that there are around 104 million Bengalis living in India (2011). In addition, there are around 27 million Bengalis living in Bangladesh (2001 census).

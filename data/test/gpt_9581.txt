The prebendaries of Aylesbury can be traced back to the early days of the Church of England. The prebendaries were originally minor ecclesiastical positions, held by clerics who performed services in a specific parish. Over time, the prebendaries became more important and were granted various privileges and responsibilities. Today, the prebendaries of Aylesbury are still active members of the clergy, and they continue to serve their respective parishes.

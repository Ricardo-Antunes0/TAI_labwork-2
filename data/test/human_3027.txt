Welch is a town in northern Craig County, Oklahoma, United States. It is  south of the Kansas state line, at the intersection of state highways 2 and 10 with U.S. Highway 59. The population was 619 at the 2010 census, an increase of 3.7 percent over the figure of 597 recorded in 2000. It is the second largest town in its county. History Welch was established in 1888 in the Cherokee Nation on land that D. B. Nigh leased from Frank Craig. The Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway (Katy) had built a line through the area in 1871, and in 1891 it built a switch on Nigh's property, providing a shipping point for local hay and grain. The town that began to grow around the switch was named for a Katy railroad official, A. L. Welch. A post office was established in 1892. The town plat was approved in 1902, and the town incorporated in 1909. A newspaper called the Welch Watchman began publication in 1902, and continued in business, although later renamed as the Welch American, until the mid 1960s.

A kuttab ( kuttāb, plural: kataatiib, ) is a traditional Arabic book of prayers or supplications, written by hand or on parchment. It is usually kept in a place of reverence such as a mosque, or a family shrine.  Kuttabs are very important to Muslims and are used throughout the day, both in formal prayer and as a tool for self-reflection. They can also be used to record prayers and readings from the Quran.

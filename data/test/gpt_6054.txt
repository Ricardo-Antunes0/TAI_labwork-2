Well-being, also known as wellness, prudential value, or flourishing, is a subjective experience or condition of being mentally and physically healthy, happy, and satisfied.  Well-being has been defined in different ways by different people, but there are some general themes that are often included. These themes include feeling good about oneself, having control over one's life, feeling positive emotions, having meaningful relationships, and having a sense of purpose.  Many people believe that well-being is a key part of achieving success. Studies have shown that people who are happy and content with their lives are more likely to be successful than those who are not. Well-being is also important for keeping people healthy and preventing them from developing diseases.  There is no one definition of well-being, because it depends on the person and the situation. However, some common definitions include feeling good about oneself, feeling positive emotions, having control over one's life, and having a sense of purpose.

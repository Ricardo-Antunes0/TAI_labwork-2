Opsithrissops (Ancient Greek: "aspect fish face") is an extinct genus of prehistoric bony fish that lived during the Thanetian stage of the Paleocene epoch. It is a small  nektonic opportunistic carnivore in the family Osteoglossiformes which includes other bony-tongues such as the extant species of Arowana and Arapaima. It hunted small invertebrates and fish similarly to today's trout and became a Paleogene keystone species in many habitats before its disappearance from the fossil record. Appearance Despite being part of the same family as more basal and primitive bony fish like the Arowana, the Opsithrissops had a body that was built for bursts of speed and powerful swimming, with a cleft caudal fin, and serrated pelvic fins. It had an elongated body with similarities to a large Herring, a durable head plated with thick bones and enlarged eyes. Its dorsal fin was placed closer to the caudal fin, and it had shiny leptoid scales all along the sides of its body. The lateral line is visible along the side and in small pockets along the fish's operculum.

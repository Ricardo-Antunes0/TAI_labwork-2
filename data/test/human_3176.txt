The Saturn izdeliye 30 is the development designation for a turbofan engine being developed by NPO Saturn for improved variants of the Sukhoi Su-57, as well as new potential tactical fighters such as the Sukhoi Su-75 Checkmate. Development In the 1990s, the collapse of the Soviet Union resulted in the disruption of funding and lengthy delays of the Mikoyan Project 1.44 for the MFI fifth-generation fighter program along with its engines, the variable cycle 18–tonne (177 kN, 40,000 lbf) class NPO Lyulka-Saturn AL-41F, internally designated izdeliye 20. In 1999, as the MFI and LFI programs were gradually being abandoned, the Russian Defence Ministry initiated the more affordable PAK FA next-generation fighter program to replace the MiG-29 and Su-27. The competition was announced in April 2001, and Sukhoi submitted its T-50 proposal with a pair of 14.5-tonne (142 kN, 32,000 lbf) class Lyulka-Saturn AL-41F1, internally designated izdeliye 117, for the PAK FA. Sukhoi was selected as the winner of the competition in April 2002 and in April 2004, it signed a contract with Lyulka-Saturn, now NPO Saturn, to develop the AL-41F1. Despite its name, the engine is actually a highly uprated and improved variant of the earlier-generation Lyulka AL-31, originally designed for the Su-27. While the AL-41F1 used the same basic architecture, it had 80% new parts and applied technology from Lyulka-Saturn's original AL-41F, which was too large for the T-50.

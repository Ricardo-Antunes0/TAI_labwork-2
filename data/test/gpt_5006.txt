The Uruguayan War (10 August 1864 – 20 May 1865) was an armed conflict fought between the forces of Brazil and Uruguay over the disputed territory of Uruguay.  The war began on 10 August 1864, when Brazilian troops invaded Uruguay. Uruguay appealed to Great Britain for help, and a British task force arrived in Montevideo on 20 May 1865, after which the war ended. The outcome of the war was a Brazilian victory, with Uruguay ceded its claims to the Rio Grande do Sul region and receiving financial compensation.

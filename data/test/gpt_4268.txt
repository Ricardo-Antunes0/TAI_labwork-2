Chondrostei is a group of primarily cartilaginous fish found in rivers and streams worldwide. They are generally small, with flattened heads and short, wide bodies. Some species are brightly coloured and some are markedly camouflaged.  The chondrostei are primitive fish, with a fossil record that extends back to the early Devonian period. They are typically found in medium to slow-moving waters near the bottom, where they feed on small invertebrates and other aquatic organisms. Some chondrostei, particularly those from temperate climates, are popular sport fish.

Fatty Finn, was a popular long-run Australian comic strip created by artist Norman Lindsay. The strip ran from 1923 to 1957. According to scholar Harry Turner, "It is generally agreed that the strip's heyday was the 1930s, when it was one of the most popular comic strips in Australia."  Fatty Finn is set in the fictional town of Finn's River and follows the misadventures of its inhabitants. The strip is notable for its light-hearted humour and recurring characters such as Fatty Finn himself, his sidekick Thrummy, and the Mayor of Finn's River.

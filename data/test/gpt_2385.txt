Coedarhydyglyn or Coedriglan, formerly Old Coedarhydyglyn (meaning "the red wood of Coedrig"), is a small village and community in the county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales, located about 5 miles (8Â km) southeast of the town of Pontypridd.  The Welsh name for the village, Coedriglan, means "the red wood of Coedrig". The settlement is on the eastern bank of the River Taff, opposite the hamlet of Treherbert. The original name for the settlement was Old Coedarhydyglyn, but it was changed to Coedarhydyglyn in 1967.  Coedarhydyglyn was historically a coal-mining village. Coal mining ceased in the early 1960s, and since then the village has been mostly dependent on agricultural and tourism industries. The village has a population of about 270 people.

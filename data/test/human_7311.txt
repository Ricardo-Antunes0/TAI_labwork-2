David Low Dodge (June 14, 1774April 23, 1852) was an American activist and theologian who helped to establish the New York Peace Society and was a founder of the New York Bible Society and the New York Tract Society. According to historian Dale R. Steiner, he wrote "some of the earliest and most effective antiwar literature in the United States." Life and career  David Low Dodge was born in Brooklyn, Connecticut on June 14, 1774. His parents were David Dodge and Mary (Stuart) Earl.   She was said to have been the daughter of a Scottish nobleman, perhaps connected with the House of Stuart, pretenders to the British throne, although this has never been confirmed.  She had previously been married to William Earl who died of yellow fever fighting for the British during an attack on Havana in 1762.    During the War of Independence, Mary's two children from this first marriage, William and Jesse Earl, were both killed on active service.  Dodge later wrote that "these events almost destroyed my mother's nervous system."

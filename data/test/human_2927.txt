1st Avenue, also known as Cumberland Avenue and Thatcher Avenue for parts of its northern segment, is a north-south street in Chicago and its western suburbs.  It marks 8400 West in the Chicago address system, being located ten and one-half miles west of State Street. Its southern segment begins at an interchange with Interstate 55 (Stevenson Expressway) in Summit.  At this point, it is called 1st Avenue and carries Illinois Route 171. In Lyons village, the road intersects U.S. Route 34 (Ogden Avenue).  In North Riverside, 1st Avenue intersects 22nd Street.  In Maywood, it intersects Roosevelt Road.  1st Avenue then intersects Interstate 290 (Eisenhower Expressway) in Maywood.

Other streets that 1st Avenue intersects in Maywood are Lake Street and Chicago Avenue.  In Melrose Park, 1st Avenue intersects Illinois Route 64 (North Avenue).  In River Grove, the road intersects Fullerton Avenue and Grand Avenue.  Between these two streets, 1st Avenue ends and continues as Thatcher Avenue, which splits to the southeast and continues until Hawthorne Avenue in River Forest.

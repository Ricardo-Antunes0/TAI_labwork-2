Louis-Marie Baader (20 June 1828, Lannion - 2 December 1887, Munich) was a French revolutionary and a member of the Communist International. He was also a German anarchist, and a leading figure of the Red Terror in Bavaria during the years around 1871.  Baader was born in Lannion, Brittany, France to a prosperous bourgeois family. At the age of sixteen he enlisted in the French army and fought in the Franco-Prussian War. Afterward he became a schoolteacher in Marseille.  In 1867 Baader joined the Paris Commune, where he served as secretary to Georges-Pierre Seurat. He also became associated with Maximilien Robespierre and Louis-Philippe Auguste Blanqui.   In 1870, Baader fled from France after being accused of sedition. He traveled to Germany and joined the German nationalist movement. In 1871, he joined the Communist League and helped organize the First International Congress of Working Men in London.  Baader was active in the Red Terror during the years around 1871. He was responsible for organizing the murders of several high-ranking officials in Bavaria, including Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck and General Albrecht von Roon.   Baader was captured by Austrian police in 1876 and tried for treason. He was found guilty and executed by hanging in Munich two years later.

Miu Hin (苗显) was one of the Five Elders of Shaolin who survived the destruction of one of the Shaolin Monasteries during the Qing dynasty. Background Miu Hin is believed to be the father of Miu Tsui Fa and the grandfather of Fong Sai-Yuk, who would later become a renowned martial artist and a popular folk hero (although this may just be a myth due to the fact that it is unknown whether Fong Sai-Yuk was a real person or a work of fiction). According to folk tale, Miu Hin was a master of the Five Shape Boxing style and various Shaolin martial arts, and passed on his knowledge to his daughter who would later pass it on to her son. He is also believed to have helped create Wing Chun with the other Five Elders. Although Miu Hin was an actual figure along with the other Five Elders, most of the stories involving him are based on folk legend, and it's unknown whether or not they're true.

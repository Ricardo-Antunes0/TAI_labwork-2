Helen West Heller (1872 – November 19, 1958) was an American painter, printmaker, and sculptor. She was born in New York City to Jewish parents. Heller studied at the Art Students League of New York with Arthur Wesley Dow and then traveled to Europe, where she studied at the Académie Julian in Paris and at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Heller returned to the United States in 1898 and settled in Provincetown, Massachusetts. There she formed a partnership with fellow painter Charles Demuth and exhibited their work together until Demuth's death in 1944. Heller is most noted for her Impressionist-inspired paintings and prints, which often depict coastal scenes and figures. She also produced works in a more abstract style, and is known for her bronze sculptures of human figures.

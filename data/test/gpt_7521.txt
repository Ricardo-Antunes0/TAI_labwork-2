Marguerite (April 24, 1920 - October 27, 1978) was a champion American Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. She is best known for winning the 1939 Preakness Stakes, the first of her three American Classic Races victories. As a broodmare, she produced the influential stallion Margaritaville.  Marguerite was bred in Kentucky by the August Belmont Stable. She was sired by the great Nearco, who won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes in 1919. Marguerite's dam, Marguerite I was a minor winner who also produced the stakes-winning stallion Margaritaville.  As a two-year-old, Marguerite finished third in the 1938 Kentucky Derby but then recorded her most successful season. She won the Hollywood Gold Cup, then defeated Be My Baby in the Preakness Stakes by a neck. Marguerite's three wins made her one of only two horses to win all three of America's Classic Races (the other being War Admiral).  Marguerite retired to become a broodmare at Claiborne Farm near Paris, Kentucky. She produced six foals between 1941 and 1949: four were winners of minor races, including a stakes-winner named Marguerite II. Her last foal was a filly named Sadler's Wells who won the 1974 Grade I Miss Liberty Stakes at Saratoga Race Course.   Marguerite died of natural causes at Claiborne Farm

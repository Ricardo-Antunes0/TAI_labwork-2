The Musmeah Yeshua Synagogue is significant because it is the only synagogue in the West Bank that is still in use. It also has historical significance because it was built by settlers who arrived in the area in the late 1970s and early 1980s, shortly after Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan. The settlers were originally drawn to Musmeah because of its proximity to Hebron, one of the largest and most important Palestinian cities.   Today, Musmeah Yeshua Synagogue remains an important symbol of coexistence between Jews and Arabs in the West Bank. The synagogue has been visited by both Israeli and Palestinian leaders, including Yasser Arafat and Ariel Sharon.

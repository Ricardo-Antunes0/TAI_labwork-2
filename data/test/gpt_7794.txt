Samuel Meredith (1741 â€“ February 10, 1817) was an American poet, journalist, and lawyer.  Born in 1741 in what is now Meredith, New York, Meredith attended the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) and then studied law in the office of John Jay. He was admitted to the bar in 1768 and commenced practice in New York City. In 1776 he married Sarah Willson.  Meredith became a prominent journalist and occasional political writer during the American Revolution. He was a delegate to the Second Continental Congress and served as a judge on the New York Court of Appeals from 1798 to 1802. In 1802 he retired from the bench and settled in Princeton, New Jersey, where he died on February 10, 1817.  Meredith's most famous work is his collection of poems, "The Poems of Samuel Meredith" (1807). He also wrote "A Plea for the West Indies" (1792), an account of his travel to those islands; "Geography" (1797), an exposition of geographical principles; and a biography of George Washington, "The Life of George Washington" (1805).

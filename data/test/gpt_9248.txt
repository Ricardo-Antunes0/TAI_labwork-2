A bulk carrier or bulker is a type of ship designed to transport large amounts of cargo, typically by sea. They differ from general cargo ships in that they have a much higher cargo capacity, and are often equipped with cranes and other machinery for the loading and unloading of cargo. Bulk carriers can vary greatly in size, from small fishing vessels to very large container ships. They are usually purpose-built, but occasionally converted container ships are used.  Bulk carriers can be divided into two main types: self-propelled bulk carriers and towed bulk carriers. Self-propelled bulk carriers use a variety of mechanisms to move their cargo, including screw propulsion, gas turbines, and nuclear power. Towed bulk carriers are usually pulled by a tugboat, although there are some that use their own engines.

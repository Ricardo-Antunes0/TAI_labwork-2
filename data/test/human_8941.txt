Interproximal reduction (IPR) (also called interproximal enamel reduction (IER) / slendering, air rotor stripping (ARS) or reproximation) is the practice of mechanically removing enamel from between the teeth to achieve orthodontic ends, such as to correct crowding, or reshape the contact area between neighboring teeth. After reducing the enamel, the procedure should also involve anatomic re-contouring and the protection of interproximal enamel surfaces. History  In 1944, Murray L. Ballard was the first to advocate for the stripping of the lower anterior teeth due to crowding in a paper published in The Angle Orthodontist. Other authors, also advocated about slenderizing the teeth for next 40 years but it was not until 1980s when John J. Sheridan's Air Rotor Stripping technique for Interproximal Reduction capture society wide interest. He published two papers in the Journal of Clinical Orthodontics in which he explained his ARS technique. He stated that the procedure of IPR can be used as an alternative to procedures of extraction or expansion of teeth during orthodontic treatment. In 2004, Zachrisson stated that IPR can be used to improve the esthetics of anterior teeth. When a crowded arch is aligned, "Black Triangles" form which can be removed with IPR of the anterior teeth.

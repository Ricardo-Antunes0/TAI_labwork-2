Michael Roland Powers (; born November 19, 1959) is the Zurich Insurance Group Chair Professor of Finance at Tsinghua University’s School of Economics and Management. Since 2014, he has held a dual appointment as professor at Tsinghua's Schwarzman College. An internationally recognized risk and insurance expert, he was a 2011 recipient of China’s Thousand Talents Plan award. In 2013, he won the Kulp-Wright Book Award for Acts of God and Man: Ruminations on Risk and Insurance (2012, Columbia University Press). Research Powers has published numerous scholarly articles on a variety of risk-related topics, with particular focus on issues of government regulation and public policy. His major research contributions include: the introduction of intertemporal discounting into collective risk theory (actuarial ruin theory); the derivation of the “Powers-Shubik square-root rule” for the approximate number of reinsurance companies operating in a national insurance market; and a utility-theoretic solution of the Two Envelopes Paradox. A frequent collaborator of the late Martin Shubik, he is responsible for promoting the application of game-theoretic modeling in insurance and actuarial science. In Acts of God and Man, he proposed a science of risk based upon: a fundamentalist Bayesian (i.e., subjective/judgmental) approach to modeling uncertainty; a formal distinction between the "aloof" risks of insurance and the "non-aloof" risks of other financial markets; and a personalized scientific method emphasizing randomized controlled studies, mathematical and game-theoretic modeling, and statistical simulation.

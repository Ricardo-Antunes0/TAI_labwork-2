Hagoromo Bungu  was a Japanese office supply and chalk company. It is best known for having produced the Hagoromo Fulltouch Chalk, a brand of blackboard chalk. Though mainly sold in Japan and South Korea, the chalk won over teachers and mathematicians worldwide with its ease of handling, writing, and erasure. Nonetheless, general decline in chalk sales among other factors led to its shuttering in 2015. The announcement of the company's closing led fans to stockpile its chalk. South Korean company Sejongmall eventually bought the Hagoromo brand and much of the original company's equipment and has manufactured the chalk in South Korea since 2016. History  The company was founded in October 1932 as Nihon Chalk Seizosho. The original factory was located in Naka-ku, Nagoya, but was destroyed in August 1944 during World War II. The company was re-established in 1947 and renamed to Hagoromo Bungu. A factory in the nearby city of Kasugai was completed in 1961, and the offices moved there in 1992.

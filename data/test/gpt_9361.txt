An application for employment is a standard document used in many cultures and countries for applying for a job, most often as part of an employment application process.  Employment applications are typically divided into cover letters, resume, and application form.   In the cover letter, the applicant will introduce themselves and explain why they are interested in the position. The resume should list all of the applicant's qualifications, including education and work experience. The application form should include all of the required information, such as name, address, and contact information.

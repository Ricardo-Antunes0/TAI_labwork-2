Silvertown railway station was on the North London Railway, a railway line that ran from Euston Station in London to Ilford, with a branch to Stratford. The railway opened on 9 November 1838 and was operated by the London and North Western Railway. The station was closed to passengers on 3 January 1966, and to goods on 31 December 1967.  The station building is now occupied by a number of businesses and is a Grade II listed building. The original tracks and platforms remain largely intact, although some of the canopy over the platforms has been removed.

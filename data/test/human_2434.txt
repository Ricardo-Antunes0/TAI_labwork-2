The Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) is a Department of the government of Fiji responsible for providing weather forecasts and is based in Nadi.  The current director of Fiji Meteorological Service is Misaeli Funaki. Since 1985, FMS has been responsible for naming and tracking tropical cyclones in the Southwest Pacific region.  Current Meteorologists working at FMS have a Graduate Diploma in Meteorology from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. History Before World War II, weather observations in Fiji were the responsibility of the harbour board and limited to recording various meteorological details at various locations around the island nation. During the 1939 Defence Conference in Wellington, New Zealand, Fiji's capital Suva was identified as the location of an upgraded meteorological service for the Pacific region. As a result, a facility was established at Laucala Bay during 1940, before it was expanded during the following year to support the operations of the Royal New Zealand Air Force. After the United States of America entered the war, meteorological operations were started at the Nadi Airport by the United States Army Air Forces Meteorological Unit during 1942.

Odelltown is a former town in southern Quebec, Canada, now a part of the municipality of Sainte-Marie-de-Beauce.  Odelltown was founded in 1847 by Samuel Odell and his brother-in-law, Andrew Dewey. It was named for their father, Ebenezer Odell. The town prospered as a lumber and agricultural centre, and attained municipal status in 1892. It declined in the early 20th century, but has since experienced a resurgence as a tourist destination.  Odelltown is located on the banks of the Saint Lawrence River, approximately south of Quebec City. The town is accessed by Route 132.  The town is home to a number of heritage buildings, including the Odelltown Presbyterian Church (1872), the Odelltown Public School (1884), and the Odelltown United Church (1902). Odelltown is also home to the world's largest cheese wheel, which was built in 1924 and is located at the cheese factory operated by Les Fromageries de l'Ouest.

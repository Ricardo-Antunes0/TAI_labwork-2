Welcome Home Armageddon is the fifth studio album by the American thrash metal band Megadeth. It was released on September 25, 2016, through Nuclear Blast.  After nearly a decade of writing and recording, Megadeth returned to the studio in late 2015 with producer Nick Raskulinecz (Korn, Deftones, Earth, Wind & Fire) to begin work on their next album. The band entered the studio with an intended goal of creating their heaviest and most aggressive record to date. "We knew we wanted to go back to basics," says frontman Dave Mustaine. "We were really happy with how the album came out."   The album's first single and title track was released on July 7, 2016. The follow-up single "Dystopia" was released on August 4th. Dystopia was featured in the video game Madden NFL 18 and is also the official song of the WWE 2K18 video game. The third single "Warheads" was released on October 14th and is also featured in the game Grand Theft Auto 5.

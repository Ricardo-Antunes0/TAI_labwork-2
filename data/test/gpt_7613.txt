Edmund Kirby (8 April 1838 – 24 April 1914) was an English artist and writer, chiefly known for his illustrations of children's books.  Kirby was born in London, the son of a sculptor and modeller. He initially trained as an artist, but became interested in writing and illustrating children's books after he was made redundant from his job in 1868. He is best known for his illustrations of stories by Lewis Carroll, including Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865), Through the Looking-Glass (1872), and The Hunting of the Snark (1876). Kirby also illustrated other books by Carroll, such as The Walrus and The Carpenter (1879) and A Trip to the Moon (1881). He retired from illustration in 1892, and died in 1914.

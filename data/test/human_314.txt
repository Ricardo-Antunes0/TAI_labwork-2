The Somberlain is the debut album by Swedish black metal band Dissection, released on 3 December 1993. It proved to be a highly influential release for both black metal and melodic death metal. The band dedicated the album to Euronymous, who had been murdered in August the same year. This is the only album that features the band's original lineup. The artwork was created by Kristian 'Necrolord' WÃ¥hlin. The album was composed and arranged between 1989 and 1993, and was recorded between 1 and 6 March 1993. Musical style  Noticing similarities to death metal bands At the Gates, Sentenced and Necrophobic, Deathmetal.org claims that Dissection utilizes black metal technique, but embraces a different aesthetic from that genre, lacking its "flow and inscrutability." According to No Clean Singing, "Dissection made their name by infusing their black metal with a layer of melody which ensured that each song was memorable, together with strong musicianship and compelling lyrics and imagery. By keeping most of their NWOBHM-isms in the minor scale, they maintained a sense of darkness and foreboding over the blasting, thrashing framework of technically-proficient black metal."

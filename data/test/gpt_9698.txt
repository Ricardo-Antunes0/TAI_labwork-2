The Battle of Panium  (also known as the Battle of Panium Gates) was a major battle fought by the Roman Republic and the Samnite League, in the Second Samnite War.  The battle took place near the town of Panium in central Italy, on March 17, 301 BC. The Romans were led by consul Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus, while the Samnites were commanded by their king, Neoptolemus. The battle ended in a decisive Roman victory, which resulted in the capture of King Neoptolemus and his army.  The Battle of Panium is significant as it marked the first time that Rome had successfully fought against an enemy army on Italian soil.

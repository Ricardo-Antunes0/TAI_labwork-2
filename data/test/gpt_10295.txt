Eunice Walker Johnson (April 4, 1916 â€“ January 6, 2006) was an American mathematician, who made fundamental contributions to the theory of knots and to the theory of partial differential equations. She was also the first African American woman to receive a doctorate in mathematics from a U.S. university.  Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Eunice Walker Johnson was the youngest of eight children of prominent African American parents. She attended segregated schools in Baltimore and later graduated from high school in 1934. In 1935 she began her undergraduate studies at Howard University, where she was one of only two women on the mathematics faculty. Johnson received her bachelor's degree in 1938 and her master's degree in 1940. She then completed her doctorate at Yale University in 1944 under the guidance of Vladimir Arnold.  After completing her graduate studies, Johnson joined the faculty at Hunter College, where she remained for the rest of her career. During that time she also served as president of the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) from 1978 to 1979 and as president of the American Mathematical Society (AMS) from 1984 to 1985. In 1992 she was awarded the National Medal of Science, which is the United States' highest honor in mathematics.  Eunice Walker Johnson died on January 6, 2006 at the age of 94.

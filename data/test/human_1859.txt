The Northern Professional Championship was a professional golf tournament played in Northern England. The event was generally a regional tournament  but from 1923 and 1927 and in 1936 it was an open event with significant prize money. The event was started in 1920 by the Northern section of the PGA with entry restricted to members of that section. In 1923 the Championship became a national event; the Championship being extended to 72 holes with £350 in prize money under the sponsorship of the Manchester Daily Dispatch. In 1925 the prize money was increased to £1000 with £350 for the winner. In early 1928 the Daily Dispatch withdrew their support for the championship which had been planned for Birkdale in July. The tournament did take place but it reverted to an event for the professionals in the Northern section of the PGA. In 1936 the event again became an open tournament called the Morecambe-Penfold Northern Open Championship with prize money of £750. However, this sponsorship only lasted for one event and the championship again became a closed tournament.

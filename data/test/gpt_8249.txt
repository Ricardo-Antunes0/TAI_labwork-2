Gaius Curtius Justus was a Roman senator and historian who wrote on the history of Rome from the time of the kings to the reign of Augustus.  Curtius was born in Rome about the year 135 BC, and died there in about 87 BC. He belonged to one of the most ancient families of Rome, and traced his ancestry back to Curtius Reginus, a companion of Romulus. In the course of his long life he filled many important public offices, and was distinguished for his learning and integrity.  His principal work is the "Historiae Romanae", which comprises twelve books, and is divided into five parts. The first four deal with the history of Rome from the foundation of the city down to the reigns of Numa Pompilius and Tullius Hostilius; part 5 embraces the reigns of Numa Pompilius and Tullius Hostilius, and includes a description of Greece. The work has not yet been translated into English, but extracts from it have been published in several works on Roman history.

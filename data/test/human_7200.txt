SoFi Stadium is a sports and entertainment complex in Inglewood, California, United States. SoFi occupies the former site of the Hollywood Park Racetrack,  from Los Angeles International Airport and immediately southeast of The Forum indoor arena. Opened in September 2020, the fixed-roof stadium is home to the National Football League (NFL)'s Los Angeles Chargers and Los Angeles Rams, as well as the annual LA Bowl in college football. The facility is a component of Hollywood Park, a master planned neighborhood in development on the site of the former racetrack. Hollywood Park Casino re-opened in a new building on the property in October 2016, becoming the development's first establishment to open. SoFi Stadium is one of two stadiums currently shared by a pair of NFL teams, the other being MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, shared by the New York Giants and New York Jets. It is the first facility outside of the New York metropolitan area to host two NFL teams simultaneously; the other three since the 1970 AFLâ€“NFL merger have been Shea Stadium, Giants Stadium and MetLife Stadium. In North American professional sports, it is the fourth facility in Greater Los Angeles shared by more than one team from the same league. The other venues have been Crypto.com Arena, which has hosted both of the city's National Basketball Association (NBA) teams, the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers, since 1999; Dignity Health Sports Park, which was home to Major League Soccer (MLS)'s LA Galaxy and the now-defunct Chivas USA from 2005 to 2014; and Dodger Stadium, which was shared by Major League Baseball (MLB)'s Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Angels from 1962 to 1965.

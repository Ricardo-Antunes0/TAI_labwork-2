In classic Korean literature, a heroic novel  is a novel that tells the life story of a hero who is born of noble blood under unusual circumstances, is abandoned or leaves home and struggles in suffering circumstances, and eventually becomes a winner. Plot  Jo Dong-il argues that classic Korean novels stemmed from four different types of folktales: life and spirit (myeonghon) tales (about a man falling in love with a dead woman), dream (mongyu) tales (about what happened in a dream), unrecorded (ilsa) tales (about an extremely talented person who does not accomplish anything notable and ends up disappearing without a trace), and heroic (yeongung) tales (about the life of a hero). The four different types of Korean novels came to be: life and spirit (myeonghon) novels, dream (mongyu) novels, unrecorded (ilsa) novels, and heroic novels. Among them, heroic novels refer to works that are structured to tell life stories of heroes. A typical life story of a hero is developed in the following form: the hero 1) is of noble blood, 2) conceived or born under unnatural circumstances, 3) has great skills unlike other ordinary people, 4) is abandoned and nearly killed, 5) meets people who can raise him and thus avoids getting killed, 6) grows up and faces a crisis, and 7) struggles through the crisis to ultimately become the winner.

Rui Luís Reis (born 19 April 1967) is a Portuguese astrophysicist, cosmologist and astrobiologist. Reis is a professor at the University of Lisbon, where he also directs the Center for Cosmology and Astrophysics. He is also a member of the Portuguese Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society of London.  Reis was the first Portuguese scientist to be elected as a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, in 2007.  Reis obtained his Ph.D. in astrophysics from the University of Lisbon in 1992, under the supervision of Fernando Fonseca. He has since been a professor at the University of Lisbon, where he also directs the Center for Cosmology and Astrophysics. Reis is also a member of the Portuguese Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society of London. In addition, he has been awarded honorary doctorates from several universities, including those in Goiás (2002), São Paulo (2004), Pernambuco (2005), and Rio de Janeiro (2007).  Reis's research centres on the study of large-scale structure and evolution of galaxies and their constituent star systems, as well as on the search for extraterrestrial life. His work has led him to develop new methods for reconstructing the early history of galaxies, and to propose that galaxies are born in violent collisions between themselves and other galaxies. Reis's current research focuses on understanding how galaxies form and evolve, and on seeking evidence for advanced alien civilizations in the cosmos

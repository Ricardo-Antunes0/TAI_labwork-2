Angary (Lat. jus angariae; Fr. droit d'angarie; Sp. derecho de angaria) is a medieval term for a right or privilege granted by a lord to his vassal in the form of an annual rent.  The term derives from the Latin word jus angariae, meaning "right of oats". The privilege may have been granted in return for military service or for other services rendered to the lord.

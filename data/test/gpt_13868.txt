Phimosis (from Greek φίμωσις phimōsis 'muzzling'.) is a condition in which the foreskin of the penis is too tight to be pulled back over the glans (head). The foreskin may be retracted only a few millimetres, or may not move at all. The condition is most common in boys and usually resolves by puberty.  Phimosis can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, infection, circumcision or an abnormal response to hormones. It may occasionally cause difficulty in urinating and difficulty in sexual intercourse. There is no known cure, but treatment may include desensitising the foreskin with topical cream or using a retraction device.

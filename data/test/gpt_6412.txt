Commission v France (or Commission of the European Communities v France) is a 1984 European Court of Justice case concerning the application of Community law to French nuclear energy policy.  The case concerned the Community's application of its nuclear non-proliferation Treaty obligations to France's nuclear programme. The French government argued that the Treaty did not apply to French nuclear activity, on the grounds that it was for France, as a nuclear power, to negotiate and implement its own safeguards agreement. The Court ruled that the Treaty did apply to France, and that the French government was required to submit its nuclear programme for review and assessment by the Community's Nuclear Safety Commission.

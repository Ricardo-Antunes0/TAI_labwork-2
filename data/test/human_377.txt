Neural coding is the transduction of environmental signals and internal signals of the body into neural activity patterns as representations forming a model of reality suitable for purposeful actions and adaptation, preserving the integrity and normal functioning of the body. Deciphering the neural code as a key to understanding the inner workings of the mind in normal and pathological states is the central task in neuroscience since the course of all vital processes of our body depends on the brain's work. Overview  Neurons are remarkable among the cells of the body in their ability to process signals (i.e., light, sound, taste, smell, touch, and others) rapidly and transmit information about them over large distances and among vast neural populations. The brain is the highest achievement in the evolution of natural information technologies in terms of speed and efficiency. It follows that, of all coding schemes, the most likely candidate for neural code is the one that produces information (code patterns) most efficiently.

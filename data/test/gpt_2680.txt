There have been several bands called The Ardells, all of which are Irish.   The first was a rock band formed in Belfast in the early 1970s. They were one of the most successful groups in Northern Ireland during the 1970s and early 1980s, and had several top ten singles in the Irish charts.  The second The Ardells was a folk-rock band from Dublin, Ireland, which formed in 2001. They released their first album, 'The Ardells', in 2003 and have since released three more albums.

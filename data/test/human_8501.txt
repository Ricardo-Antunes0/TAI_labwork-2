Norton-on-Tees railway station served the village of Norton, County Durham, England from 1877 to 1960, originally on the Port Clarence Branch of the Clarence Railway. For much of its later life the station was also a minor stop on the Durham Coast Line. History  The first station to serve the village of Norton-on-Tees (known as ) was opened by the Clarence Railway at the junction between their branches to North Shore and  which opened in 1833. However this station was poorly situated for the village it served and so the North Eastern Railway replaced this station with a new one further along the Port Clarence Branch in July 1877.  Shortly beyond Billingham-on-Tees station, the next station to the west on the Port Clarence Branch, the former Stockton and Hartlepool Railway branched off the former Clarence Railway route towards West Hartlepool. It was originally called Norton Junction in the Bradshaw timetable but it was renamed to Norton-on-Tees on 1 October 1901. Originally this had been a branch line however, after the North Eastern Railway completed the Durham Coast Line with the opening of the coastal route between  and West Hartlepool in 1905, Norton station became a stop on the new coastal trunk route.

André Lagarrigue (1924 – 14 January 1975) was a French composer, arranger and pianist.  Lagarrigue was born in 1924 in the town of Rodez. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire with Nadia Boulanger and Olivier Messiaen. From 1949 to 1951 he was a student of Darius Milhaud at the École Normale de Musique. Lagarrigue's early works were influenced by Messiaen and Pierre Boulez, but he later developed a distinctive style of his own which drew on elements of jazz, Indian classical music and Latin American folklore. His best-known works include the orchestral suite "Le Grand Cahier" (1957), the opera "Ete" (1963), the orchestral suite "Aventures" (1969) and the ballet "Danse sacrée" (1972). Lagarrigue died in 1975 at the age of 54.

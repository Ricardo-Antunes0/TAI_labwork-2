Procedural records are the set of constituent documents and other materials that support the orderly management and administration of a public body. The term typically refers to the records of formal proceedings, such as court cases, administrative hearings, or legislative debates.  Public bodies must keep procedural records to ensure that their activities are conducted in an orderly and lawful manner. Procedural records can include documents that describe the steps taken to reach a decision, the procedures used to make that decision, or the rules that were followed. They can also include documents that document the actions taken by public officials in carrying out their duties.  Procedural records are essential for monitoring the performance of public bodies and for ensuring that their activities are conducted in accordance with applicable law. They can also be used to investigate possible violations of law.  Public bodies should maintain procedural records in a format that is easy to access and understand. They can also make these records available to the public for inspection or copying.

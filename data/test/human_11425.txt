Olumide  Edwards Adegbulu (born September 1976) popularly known by his stage name "Olu Maintain" (sometimes called Mr. Yahooze) is a Nigerian recording artist, songwriter and performer. He co-founded the musical group known as Maintain with his cousin, Tolu Ogunniyi. Adeboye Bammeke, popularly known as Big Bamo, joined the group, which released six albums between 1998 and 2004 with the hit songs "I Catch Cold", "Domitila" and "Alo" before they separated in 2004. Olu rose to prominence in May 2007 with the release of the hit song "Yahooze" which literarily hail internet fraud and lavish spending from his debut studio album, Yahooze (2007), and a second album, Maintain Reloaded (2008). He featured Big Bamo in the single "Kowonje". "Yahooze" was named Hottest Single of the Year at the Nigeria Entertainment Awards. Olu Maintain's "Yahooze" was the genesis of an open declaration of support for internet fraud and lavish spending by an "A list" artiste which is now a norm in the Nigeria music industry.

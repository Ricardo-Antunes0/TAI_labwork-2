The Alesha Show is the second studio album by English singer-songwriter Elton John, released in 1973. The album was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, England and produced by John and his longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin.  The album's release marked a return to the more pop-oriented sound of John's early career, with its title track becoming his first UK number one single since "Wonderful Crazy Night" in 1970. "The Alesha Show" also produced the international hit singles "Rocket Man" and "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me". The album reached number two on the UK Albums Chart and went on to sell over a million copies worldwide.  John has cited "The Alesha Show" as one of his favorite albums, describing it as "one of my favourites because it's just so eclectic."   The Alesha Show was remastered and reissued in 2001 with four bonus tracks.

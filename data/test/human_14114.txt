Denys Douglas Dobson (28 October 1880 â€“ 10 July 1916) was an English international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Oxford University and Newton Abbot. Dobson played international rugby for England and the British Isles team on its 1904 tour of Australia. Dobson was the first player from a British touring rugby team to be dismissed from the playing field, when he was sent off in a match against the Northern District in Newcastle, New South Wales. Rugby career Dobson first came to note as a rugby player when he was selected to represent Oxford University. He won three sporting Blues, all in rugby union, playing in The Varsity Match from 1899 through to 1901. While still playing for Oxford University, Dobson was selected to represent England at international level. Dobson played in two full Home Nations Championships, 1902 and 1903. His first match was a narrow loss to Wales, a game which saw all 8 English points coming from the forward positions, one try came from Dobson himself, scoring on his debut. Despite winning both games against Scotland and Ireland, England came second in the Championship to a Wales Triple Crown winning team. Before the end of the 1902/03 season, Dobson played for his third notable team when he was selected to play for invitational touring side the Barbarians.

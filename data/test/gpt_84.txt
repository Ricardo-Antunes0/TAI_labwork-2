John Beadle Price (September 13, 1883 â€“ November 17, 1966) was an American biologist, known for his work on genetics.  Price was born in Hagerstown, Maryland, United States. He received his B.S. from the University of Maryland in 1906 and his M.S. from the University of Chicago in 1908. Price then worked as a research associate at Johns Hopkins University from 1908 to 1912, and at the Carnegie Institution of Washington from 1912 to 1917. He served in the United States Army during World War I, and as a research associate at Columbia University from 1919 to 1922. Price then became a professor of genetics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he remained until his retirement in 1955.  Price's major research interests were in the field of genetics, particularly in the area of Mendelian inheritance. He is best known for his work on dominant and recessive alleles, and for his textbook on genetics, which remains one of the most widely used texts in the field. Price was also a recipient of the National Medal of Science, awarded by President Harry S. Truman in 1954.  Price died at the age of 78 years in Champaign, Illinois, United States.

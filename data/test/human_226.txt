Renato Zveteremich (Trieste, Italy, 1893 - Milan, Italy, 1951) was an Italian advertising director and publicist. He is known for heading the Sales Development and Advertising Dept. of the Olivetti company in the 1930s. He joined Olivetti in 1931, at a crucial moment in the expansion plan conceived by Adriano Olivetti, and was appointed art director of the Advertising Services. Under his guidance, the Milan offices acquired a revered status. An early advocate of modern design, Zveteremich adopted a 'humanistic' approach that will have a long-lasting influence on the style of Olivetti's communication. His campaigns were characterized by a modern, multidisciplinary approach. Influenced by rationalist architecture and modern art, Zveteremich hired young commercial designers with an avant-garde edge: Bruno Munari, Riccardo Ricas, Xanti Schawinsky, Erberto Carboni, Luigi Veronesi, Giovanni Pintori, Costantino Nivola, the architects Luigi Figini and Gino Pollini; and worked closely with typographer and art critic Guido Modiano. The different style and contributions of each designer conflated into a 'collective' visual culture, in opposition to the fragmented marketing approach common in advertising at the time.

The Lehi Tabernacle served as a tabernacle of the Lord in the wilderness during the time of the Jaredites. It is located in Lamanite Hill, near Mount Timpanogos in Price, Utah.  The Lehi Tabernacle was built by the Nephites in the land of Nephi between 600 BC and 400 BC. It was used as a place of worship for the Nephites and their descendants until about AD 400. The Tabernacle was destroyed by an earthquake in 538 AD and never rebuilt.  Today, remnants of the Tabernacle can be found at Lamanite Hill near Mount Timpanogos in Price, Utah. These include a tabernacle pole, a section of the curtain wall, and part of a door frame.

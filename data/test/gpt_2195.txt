Interphase is the portion of the cell cycle during which the cell divides into two cells.  The cell cycle is a series of processes that take place in the cells of an organism. The cell cycle is divided into two phases: the interphase and the mitotic phase. The interphase is the first phase and it lasts for about 50-70 minutes. During the interphase, the cell grows and copies its DNA. After the interphase, the cell enters the mitotic phase. The mitotic phase lasts for about 10 minutes and during this phase, the cell divides into two new cells.

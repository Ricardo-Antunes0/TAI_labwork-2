Gille (or Gilla) Aldan (Gaelic: "Servant of Aldan") (c.1274 – c.1341) was a medieval Irish poet, probably of Munster origin.  Gille Aldan is one of the most important early Irish poets, and one of the few who wrote in both the Old and Middle Irish languages. He was born in the late 1270s or early 1280s, probably in County Cork or Munster, and died around 1341. He was a member of the Uí Fidgenti branch of the Cenél nEógain, and his poems reflect the influence of both the courtly tradition of his tribe and the more contemplative forms characteristic of Munster poetry.  Aldan is best known for his long poem Togail Bruide, which is also one of the earliest examples of a chivalric romance. He also wrote a number of shorter poems, including a collection of love lyrics known as Aislinge Meic Con Glais (The Songs of Aislinge). Aldan is considered one of the most important early Irish poets, and his works have been influential on later poets such as Elizabeth Barrett Browning and W.B. Yeats.

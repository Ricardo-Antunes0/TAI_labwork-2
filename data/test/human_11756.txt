Battle of Sulukh was fought between Armenian fedayis and Turkish forces on 27 May 1907. It is most notable for being the conflict that led to the death of Gevorg Chavush. Battle At that time, Sulukh was a small village of around a hundred houses on the road from Erzurum to Mu≈ü. The fedayi entourage was camping there overnight, when the Turks attacked them. Fedayi leaders Gevorg Chavush, Sbaghanats Kaleh, Seito Boghos, Ghazar of Shenik, and Ruben Ter Minasian (who later recounted the battle in his memoirs) were present. The Armenians were besieged by the Turks. At the start of the battle, the resistance of the Armenians was successful. However, after a massive Turkish attack, the Turks had captured the village. During the defense, Sbaghanats Kaleh was killed and Gevorg Chavush was wounded and lost consciousness (which later caused his death). Nevertheless, the death of the colonel Keosse Binbashi panicked the Turks, as a result of which, Armenians launched a surprise attack, and the fedayeen were able to carry Gevorg away from the village. Gevorg's comrades carried him to the bank of the Aratsani River (Eastern Euphrates) and left him under a bridge with some villagers from Sulukh; Gevorg died of his wounds the next morning on 28 May.

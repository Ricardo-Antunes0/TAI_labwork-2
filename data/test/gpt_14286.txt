The Robert Smalls House is a historic house in Beaufort, South Carolina. It was built in 1875 for Robert Smalls, an African American slave who became the first black person to own his own property in the United States. The house is a two-story, frame structure with a gable roof and a front porch. It is one of the few surviving examples of African American vernacular architecture in the South.  Robert Smalls was born in 1795 in Beaufort, South Carolina, one of twelve children of a slave mother and a slave father. In 1819, Smalls was sold to Hugh Alexander and moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. There, he worked as a carpenter and cabinetmaker. In 1836, he bought his freedom and moved back to Beaufort.  In 1875, Smalls built the Robert Smalls House on land he had purchased near Beaufort. The house is one of the only surviving examples of African American vernacular architecture in the South. It is also one of the few houses that has been continuously occupied by the same family since it was built. In 1984, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

Li Zhongyan (李仲言) (died December 16, 835), courtesy name Zongyi (宗義), was an official of the Chinese Tang dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reigns of Emperor Wenzong and Emperor Xianzong.  Li Zhongyan was born in the Tang dynasty capital Chang'an, and started his career as a military officer. He later served as the prefect of Fenyang (汾陽, in modern Xinxiang, Henan) and then the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (平盧, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong). He was made a chancellor by Emperor Wenzong in 835 and continued to serve under Emperor Xianzong. In 837, he was made the military governor of Hezhong Circuit (河中, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan). However, two years later, he was removed from his post after it was revealed that he had embezzled government funds. He died later that year.

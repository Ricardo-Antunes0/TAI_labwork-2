Irditoxin is a three-finger toxin (3FTx) protein found in the venom of the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) and likely in other members of the genus Boiga. It is a heterodimer composed of two distinct protein chains, each of the three-finger protein fold, linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond. This structure is unusual for 3FTx proteins, which are most commonly monomeric. Structure  Three-finger toxin (3FTx) proteins canonically consist of approximately 60-80 amino acid residues that assume a structure with three "finger"-like beta strand-containing loops projecting from a core stabilized by four intramolecular disulfide bonds. Irditoxin is a covalent heterodimer in which two subunits are linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond. Each subunit is of the three-finger toxin (3FTx) protein superfamily and is most closely related to the "non-conventional" 3FTx subclass, characterized by the presence of an additional disulfide bond in the first of the canonical three "finger" loops. Each subunit thus contains 11 cysteine residues: the eight canonical residues that form the core disulfide bonds, the two in the first loop forming the non-conventional disulfide, and the one that forms the dimeric linkage. Irditoxin subunits A and B are 75 and 77 amino acid residues long, respectively, and each possess a seven-residue extension with a pyroglutamic acid post-translational modification at the N-terminus.

Lone Oaks, also known as the Benjamin Deyerle Place and Winsmere, is a Greek Revival mansion listed on both the National Register of Historic Places and the Virginia Landmarks Register in the Greater Deyerle neighborhood of the independent city of Roanoke, Virginia, U.S.A. Located at 3402 Grandin Road Extension SW, Lone Oaks was completed in 1850 as the private residence of Benjamin Deyerle overlooking Mudlick Creek. Today the home still stands, with the surrounding area now developed as single family home typical of those built during the 1970s-80s. Today the home remains as a private residence.   The house is L-shaped with a single pediment Doric entrance portico, which has plain square pillars and fluted columns. It became a Virginia Historic Landmark and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Main House "A two-story, L-shaped brick house with three bay facade, rigid symmetry, Parged antae and full Entablature, Lone Oak is well within the form and style of the other houses Benjamin Deyerle erected during his most prolific period, between 1848 and 1851. Today, Lone Oaks retains its original, well proportioned Doric Portico with Pediment supported by paired groups of outside pillars and inside columns."

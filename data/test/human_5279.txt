Richard Hellings (1 December 1874 â€“ 9 February 1938) was an English-born Welsh rugby union forward who played international rugby for Wales and club rugby for Llwynypia. Hellings was noted for his strength built from years cutting coal as a Rhondda miner. Hellings later played rugby for Cardiff, Exeter and Devon. Rugby career Tiverton born, Hellings moved to the Rhondda while a young boy and later found work as a coal miner in Llwynypia, there Hellings joined local rugby team Llwynypia RFC. In the late 1890s an ageing and failing Welsh pack forced the selectors to look for options outside the likes of Newport and Cardiff. This saw the emergence of the 'Rhondda forward', manual workers chosen from the villages and towns of the south Wales valleys. In 1897 Hellings was chosen to face England as part of the 1897 Home Nations Championship along with fellow Rhondda players, Jack Rhapps and Dai Evans. Under the captaincy of legendary Welsh player Arthur Gould Wales beat England by a goal and two tries to nil.

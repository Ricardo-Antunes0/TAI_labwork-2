The Zulu serotine (Neoromicia zuluensis), also called the Zulu cobra, is a venomous elapid snake endemic to Africa.  The Zulu serotine is a medium-sized snake, with a total length of about 120 cm (47 in). It is dark brown or black, and has a distinct yellow line running from the top of its head to the tip of its tail. The male has a more brightly coloured head and chin than the female, and both sexes have bright yellow eyes.  The Zulu serotine is found predominantly in the Zulu Highlands, but it has also been recorded from a few other locations in South Africa, including the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and Swaziland. It is generally found in rocky areas or open woodland, but it has also been recorded from grasslands and even urban areas.  The Zulu serotine is specialist predator of small mammals, including rodents and other small mammals. It hunts by ambushing its prey from a hiding place, typically at night. It has two pairs of venomous fangs which it uses to inject its victims with venom. The venom contains toxins which can kill or paralyse its prey quickly and efficiently.

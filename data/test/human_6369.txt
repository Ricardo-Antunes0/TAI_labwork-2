Tomás Francisco Gutiérrez Chávez was a Peruvian Colonel who, along with his brothers, led a coup against President José Balta Montero and served as the Supreme Leader of Peru for four days in July 1872. From July 22, 1872 to July 26, 1872, Gutiérrez was the de facto leader of Peru and the self-proclaimed "Supreme Leader of the Republic." He was overthrown just four days after his proclamation and lynched. Peru later regained some political stability with the election of Manuel Pardo, although this stability was short-lived as a foreign threat began to arise in Chile. Early life  Gutiérrez was born in Huancarqui to a family of Spanish descent in March of 1817, the third child and first son of parents Luis Gutiérrez and Julia Chávez in what was then the Viceroyalty of Peru. He worked as a muleteer, known also as an arriero, and later enlisted himself in the army. His three younger brothers—Silvestre, Marcelino and Marceliano—followed his example, although without distinguishing themselves, as Tomás did.

In computer security, an attribute certificate,    also called an authorization certificate, is a digital signature that identifies the holder of an identity certificate.  An attribute certificate is issued by a certification authority (CA) and binds the identity of the holder to the attributes specified in the certificate. The certificate is used to prove ownership of an identity, for example, when logging in to a system.   An authorization certificate is generally only issued to individuals who have been granted authority to do so by a CA. This might be a system administrator, server operator, or other authorized personnel. The authorization certificate binds the identity of the holder to the authority to use the specified attributes. This is used, for example, when a user logs in to a system and is presented with a list of available resources. The user can then choose which resources they wish to access.

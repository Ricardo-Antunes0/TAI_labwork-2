Vachellia nilotica, more commonly known as Acacia nilotica, and by the vernacular names of gum arabic tree, babul, thorn mimosa, Egyptian acacia or thorny acacia, is a flowering tree in the family Fabaceae. It is native to Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. It is also considered a 'weed of national significance' and an invasive species of concern in Australia), as well as a noxious weed by the federal government of the United States. Taxonomy This species of tree is the type species of the Linnaean genus Acacia, which derives its name from , , the name given by early Greek botanist-physician Pedanius Dioscorides (ca. 40â€“90) to this tree as a medicinal, in his book Materia Medica. The genus Acacia was long known not to be taxonomically monophyletic, but proposals to split the genus were not coherent. During a congress held in Australia of the international union which regulates plant taxonomy, Australians were able to force through a name change (as everyone present is allowed a vote, and there are simply more Australians in Australia), where all the original Acacia species found across the countries of Africa, Asia and the Americas would need to be renamed, as opposed to the species in Australia and a few Pacific nations. This is generally considered incorrect, as the principle of priority holds that a genus is affixed to a type species, i.e. the first correct name given to the plant should be retained, but one is allowed to break these rules with a majority vote. Australian people argued that they were too lazy rename their acacias, and it should be the problem of African countries, centuries-old rules be damned. Australia has many species which have been classified in the Acacia genus. The renaming of the traditional Acacia to Vachellia remains controversial. For the new classification of this and other species historically classified under genus Acacia, see the Acacia.

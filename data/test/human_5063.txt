The Bisri Dam is a planned dam on the Bisri river in Lebanon. The dam is part of the Lebanon Water Supply Augmentation project, with water management as the primary purpose. The project is organised by the Government of Lebanon in order to tackle the water problems in Lebanon and specifically in the Greater Beirut and the Mount Lebanon area. The expected funding for the project was coming from the World Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, and the Government of Lebanon, and it is executed by the Lebanese Council for Development and Reconstruction. The Bisri dam project started on September 30, 2014 and is projected to end by June 30, 2024. The dam is planned to be located 35 kilometres south of Beirut in Bisri Valley close to the village of Bisri. Due to its impact on the environment, archaeological sites, agriculture and its seismic risk the dam project is subject to opposition from civil society, political parties, adjacent municipalities and also internationally. On April 17, 2020, and in response to criticism from civil society, the World Bank announced that it has frozen its funding for the project.  On September 4, 2020, the World bank announced that it is cancelling its funding to the dam.

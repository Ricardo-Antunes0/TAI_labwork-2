"Zangezur corridor"  is a name for a geological feature in the Eastern Alps, situated in the canton of Graubünden. It is a major north-south passage in the eastern Alps and was formed during the Variscan orogeny.  The Zangezur corridor is about long and wide, and runs from the valley of Zangezur in the canton of Graubünden to the valley of Andermatt in the canton of Uri. The corridor is part of a larger feature known as the Bernina corridor, which links the Bernina Pass in Switzerland with the Valais Alps.  The Zangezur corridor is made up of Precambrian gneisses and schists, which were formed during the Variscan orogeny. The rocks were formed about 700 million years ago, and are some of the oldest rocks in the Eastern Alps. The corridor is traversed by several small streams, which provide valuable water resources to farmers and tourists.

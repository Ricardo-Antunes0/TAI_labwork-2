Großbottwar (or Grossbottwar) is a town in the Ludwigsburg district of Baden-Württemberg, Germany.  It sits within the Neckar River basin and is located on a tourist route through the Württemberg wine region.  The Großbottwar region has been inhabited since at least the Stone Age and was occupied by the Romans.  The town itself was founded sometime during the mid-13th century by an alliance of prominent families.  In 1971, Großbottwar incorporated the formerly independent communities of Hof und Lembach and Winzerhausen. Unlike most towns in the region, Großbottwar was neither heavily damaged by war nor by urban fires, so there are many old buildings from the 15th through the 17th centuries with original and well-preserved timber framing.  The 16th century Rathaus, or town hall, is noted for its half-timber construction and decoratively carved façade.  The Stadtschänke, approximately dated to 1434, is the oldest half-timber building in the Ludwigsburg district.

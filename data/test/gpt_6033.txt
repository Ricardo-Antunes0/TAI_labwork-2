Sveadal is a private summer resort in the Santa Monica Mountains, located in Los Angeles County, California. The resort is a member of the Napa Valley Association of Resort Properties.  Sveadal is located at an elevation of 2,000 feet (610 m) in the Santa Monica Mountains, about 5 miles (8 km) west of the city of Santa Monica and 9 miles (14 km) north-northwest of downtown Los Angeles.  The resort has two golf courses, one tennis court, a pool, a spa, and a dozen villas with private pools and gardens.   The resort was founded in 1927 by Rudolph Arnheim and his wife Astrid. Arnheim was a painter who had met Astrid while she was vacationing in Europe. The Arnheims built Sveadal as a place for artists to congregate and work. Among the artists who have stayed at Sveadal are Philip Guston and Andrew Wyeth.   In 1999, Sveadal was purchased by the Pardee family. The Pardees are longtime residents of Los Angeles County and entrepreneurs in the wine industry. They have continued to operate Sveadal as a private summer resort while also investing in its future by updating its facilities and expanding its offering to include more activities such as golf, tennis, horseback riding, fly fishing, golf lessons and weddings.

Ella Mundhenke Russell (c. 1868 â€“ March 6, 1956) was an American suffragette, businessperson, and politician. She was president of the Everett Suffrage Club. Russell "famously defended women's right to vote before a crowd of 6,500 during a Billy Sunday crusade", and advanced the women's suffrage cause in the city of Everett and the state of Washington. In 1924, she won the nomination as the Republican candidate for the state senate in her district, but was defeated at the election by a Republican "sticker" candidate. Biography  Russell was born in Illinois in about 1868, the daughter of Henry and Elizabeth Mundhenke. She had worked as a schoolteacher in Illinois for five years, and in Washington for two years. She married Charles E. Russell, a wood shingle miller, with whom she had four daughters and a son. Russell assisted her husband with the shingle business during his lifetime, and carried on operating the mill after his death in 1925.

A ticker symbol or stock symbol is a design that is used to uniquely identify a particular security or other financial instrument. The first use of a ticker symbol was in 1852 when the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) began using the design of the sun and stars to identify the price of stocks.  Ticker symbols are used on stock exchanges, and usually consist of the company's name followed by a hyphen and a three-letter code. For example, McDonald's Corporation (MCD) is trading under "MCD" while Intel Corporation (INTC) is trading under "INTC". The ticker symbol is unique to each company and is one way in which customers can quickly identify stocks.

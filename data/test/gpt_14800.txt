Fishing in Colorado has brought in a wealth of fishing opportunities for people of all ages and experience levels. The elevated altitude allows for a cooler climate that favours the growth of fish in colder water, while the wide variety of habitat options found throughout the State make for an incredible variety of fishing experiences.   The three main types of fishing found in Colorado are ice fishing, warm water fishing, and fly fishing. Ice fishing refers to angling activities that take place on or below the surface of frozen water. This can be done in many different ways, including using a rod and reel to catch fish that are swimming in or near the ice, or using a ice auger to create holes in the ice and wait for fish to appear. Warm water fishing refers to angling activities that take place in or near bodies of water that are generally warmer than freezing temperatures. This can include fish caught on fly rods and reels, as well as bass, catfish, and trout caught using artificial lures. Fly fishing refers to angling activities that take place using rods and reels with fly gear, such as fly rods and flies. This type of fishing is best suited for fish that live in or near bodies of water where insects are present, such as trout and salmon.

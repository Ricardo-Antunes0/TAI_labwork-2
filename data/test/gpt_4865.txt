James Harkin is a British podcaster, television presenter, and political activist. He is the founder and owner of the independent political podcast, The Harkin Podcast, which is hosted by Harkin and produced by Brendan O'Neill.  Harkin was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1962. He moved to England at the age of seventeen, and began working in a number of manual jobs before becoming a sales representative for a British computer company. In the early 1990s, he began to work on a documentary about British trade unions for Channel 4. The documentary was never aired, but its footage formed the basis of Harkin's first podcast, The Trade Union Show, which he started in 2003.  Harkin has been an outspoken critic of UK Prime Minister Theresa May's policies since the 2017 general election. He has also been critical of US President Donald Trump and Brexit leader Nigel Farage.

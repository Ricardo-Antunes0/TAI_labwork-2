The Lateran Obelisk is the largest standing obelisk in the world. It was erected by the Roman Emperor Constantine I near the Lateran Palace in Rome, Italy, in 315 AD to commemorate the victory over his rival Maxentius at the Battle of Milvian Bridge.  The Lateran Obelisk is made of red granite from Egypt and measures 86.3 metres (282 feet) high, 3.36 metres (11.4 feet) wide and 2.76 metres (9.2 feet) thick at the base. It weighs over 250 tonnes and is surmounted by a hexagonal capstone, decorated with an image of Constantine and the Chi-Rho symbol.

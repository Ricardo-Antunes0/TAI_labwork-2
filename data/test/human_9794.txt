Peggy Antonio (2 June 1917 â€“ 11 January 2002, Melbourne, Australia) was an Australian women's Test cricketer, known as the "Girl Grimmett". Antonio was raised in Port Melbourne, Victoria, a working class suburb of Melbourne.  Her father was a Chilean docker of French and Spanish descent who died when she was 15 months.  With the encouragement of her uncle she learnt her cricket from the boys in her neighbourhood streets.  As a young girl during the Great Depression, she was lucky enough to find work at a shoe factory in the industrial suburb of Collingwood.  The factory was home to a women's cricket team where Antonio came to the attention of Eddie Conlon, a club cricketer with an encyclopaedic knowledge of the game.  With the assistance of Conlon, Antonio developed a rare mix of leg spin and off spin, including a top spinner and a wrong'un.

Holotrichia serrata, commonly known as the sugarcane white grub, or cockchafer grub, is a species of dung beetle found in India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Description Adult female beetles lay white, almost round eggs. The first and second instars are translucent, whitish-yellow with a characteristic ‘C’ – shape. The third instar is a dirty white color with an average length of about 34 to 39 mm.  The clearly marked brownish-orange colored head consists of strong mandibles. Slender antennae are long and brown. The instar period lasts for 60 to 70 days, and are followed by a short pre-pupal period of two days. Pupation is within an earthen chamber where the third instar burrowed deep into the soil and prepared a small earthen cell. This exarate pupa is about 25 to 27 mm in length where the pupal period is 13 to 19 days. After the onset of rain, beetles are emerged within 3 to 4 days. Adult beetles are brown in color where females are larger than males with an average length about 23 to 25 mm. Adults can survive for 12 to 26 days in captivity.

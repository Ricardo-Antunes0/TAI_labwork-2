Massey Sahib is a 1985 Hindi drama film directed by Pradip Krishen, starring Raghubir Yadav in the title role. It was Krishen's first film, and was an adaptation of Joyce Cary's 1939 novel Mister Johnson. It won Yadav two international acting awards. The film also stars Arundhati Roy, who was yet to write her first novel and win the Man Booker Prize, along with Barry John and Virendra Saxena. Synopsis The film is set in 1929, in a small town in Central India. Francis Massey (Raghubir Yadav) is a clerk in the District Collector's office in the colonial administration of British India. He aspires to be like the colonial rulers, and thinks of himself as different from his Indian compatriots. He falls in love with a tribal girl Saila (Arundhati Roy), and browbeats her family into agreeing to their marriage. They have a church wedding, with Saila's brother Pasa (Virendra Saxena) as the bemused witness. In his wish to help the rulers – in particular, his immediate superior, District Collector Charles Adam (Barry John) – Massey adopts methods that are irregular. Adam's dream project of building a road through the forest is stuck for lack of funds. Massey manages to get it completed using a mixture of manipulation, persuasion and threats. To his surprise, he is accused of corruption by the very boss whom he had meant to help, and who had condoned his earlier transgressions. His wife too is forcefully taken back by her family. He turns for help to his friend Banaji (Madan Lal) to get his wife back. Banaji refuses to help him. In an act of frustrated rage, Massey kills Banaji. He is arrested for murder, and Adam advises him to plead guilty to accidental manslaughter. However, Massey refuses, secure in the belief that his Adam Sahib will help him out, leading to the tragic denouement.

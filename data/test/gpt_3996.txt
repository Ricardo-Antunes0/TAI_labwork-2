Johan Nieuhof (22 July 1618 in Uelsen â€“ 27 October 1676 in The Hague) was a Dutch Golden Age painter.  Nieuhof was born in Uelsen, in the present-day German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. He was the son of a miller, and learned to paint from his father. He moved to Amsterdam in 1638, and became a member of the guild of Saint Luke in 1641. He married Sara Braams in 1648, with whom he had six children.  Nieuhof was popular for his religious paintings, which were often commissioned by churches. He was especially skilled at depicting light and shadow, and also made a great number of still lifes. He is best known for his work in the style of Rembrandt, but he developed his own style somewhat later. Nieuhof died in The Hague, aged 68.

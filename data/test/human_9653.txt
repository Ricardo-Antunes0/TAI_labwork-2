Hamar Cathedral  is the episcopal seat of the Diocese of Hamar within the Church of Norway. The cathedral is located in the town of Hamar which is in Hamar Municipality in Innlandet county, Norway. It is one of the churches for the Hamar parish which is part of the Hamar domprosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Hamar. The whitewashed brick church was built in a long church design in 1866 using plans drawn up by the architect Heinrich Ernst Schirmer. The church seats about 380 people. History For several centuries, the Catholic Church ran the Old Hamar Cathedral in the town of Hamar. This cathedral was constructed from 1152 to 1200 and it served as the seat of the old Roman Catholic Diocese of Hamar until the Protestant Reformation. After the Reformation, the Diocese was closed and the Cathedral was used as a regular parish church within the Diocese of Christiania. The church remained in existence until 1567 when it was burned down by the Swedish Army during the Northern Seven Years' War. After that time, the people of Hamar had to worship at the nearby Vang Church in Ridabu.

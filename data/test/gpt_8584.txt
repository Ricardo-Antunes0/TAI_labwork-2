Martin Borrhaus (Latin: Martin Cellarius) (1499â€“11 October 1566) was a Swiss physician, pharmacist, and botanist. He was one of the founders of the modern pharmaceutical industry.  Born in Bern, Cellarius studied medicine at the University of Basel, where he was influenced by the works of Andreas Vesalius. After completing his studies, he worked as a doctor in his hometown. In 1533, Cellarius moved to Frankfurt am Main, where he established a large pharmaceutical business. He also became interested in botany and published a number of works on the subject. Cellarius retired from business in 1566 and died the following year in Frankfurt.

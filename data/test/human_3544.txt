The Obuchi Cabinet governed Japan from July 1998 to April 2000 under the leadership of Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi, who took office after winning the Liberal Democratic Party leadership. Initially a continued LDP single-party government without legislative majority in parliament on its own after the 1998 election, it expanded to become a coalition involving first the Liberal Party and then the New Komeito over the course of its term. The government focused on economic revival, with former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa recalled to the position of Finance Minister, and introduced policies designed to stimulate the economy through tax cuts and public spending increases. Obuchi reshuffled his cabinet twice, firstly in January 1999 after having negotiated a coalition agreement with the Liberal Party. This did not bring about any major change in personnel other than to bring Liberal Takeshi Noda into government as Home Minister, and reduce the number of ministers by doubling up portfolios. The second reshuffle in October 1999 was a more substantial reconstruction, and took place following Obuchi's re-election as LDP president. At the same time, the coalition expanded again to include the New Komeito, beginning the long-running LDP-NKP partnership. The coalition continued until April 2000 when Liberal Leader Ichirō Ozawa decided to withdraw from the arrangement, causing a section of the Liberal Party to break away and form the New Conservative Party, which remained in the government.

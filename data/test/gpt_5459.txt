The gardens became well known for their exotic plants and ornamental trees, as well as their beautiful walks and lake.

The gardens were restored in the late 1960s and re-opened to the public in 1971. Today, Cremorne Gardens is a popular tourist destination, with a range of activities available including bushwalking, picnicking, swimming and boating.

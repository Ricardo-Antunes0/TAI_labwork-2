Lawrence Washington (1659 – February 1698), was a colonial-era Virginia planter, lawyer, soldier and politician, now principally remembered as the paternal grandfather of George Washington. Early life and education Lawrence was born in September 1659, on his father's estate at Mattox Creek and when he was five years old, the family moved to a nearby plantation on Bridges Creek, in Westmoreland County, Colony of Virginia. He was named to honor his paternal grandfather, former Oxford don Rev. Lawrence Washington (1602–1652).  His father, John Washington, had emigrated from Essex, England and married Anne Pope. His mother (who died when Lawrence was a child) was the daughter and heiress of Col. Nathaniel Pope, a merchant and planter who had emigrated first to Maryland, then to Virginia's Northern Neck decades earlier. Col. Pope had given his son-in-law start-up capital and the property as a marriage present, and died shortly before his first grandson's birth. Before her death, Ann Pope bore two more children who survived to adulthood: John Washington (c. 1660 – 1698) and Anne Washington Wright (c. 1660 – 1697). The widower John Washington married twice more, both times to widows, with whom he did not have children but substantially increased his landholdings.

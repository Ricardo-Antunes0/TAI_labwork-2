In quantum mechanics, the Mott problem is the question of how a system of particles can remain in thermal equilibrium, meaning that the average energy of the particles is constant.  The problem was first posed by Nobel laureate and physicist Richard Mott in 1930. It is a fundamental problem in the theory of quantum mechanics and has been studied extensively by physicists.  A system of particles in thermal equilibrium is said to be in a state of statistical equilibrium if the average energy of the particles in the system is constant. The problem is to find a way for a system of particles to remain in statistical equilibrium, despite the fact that some particles may be moving around and exchanging energy with other particles.

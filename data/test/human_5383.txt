He's A Smoothie (foaled 1963 in Ontario) was a Canadian Thoroughbred Champion and Hall of Fame racehorse who set track records on both dirt and  turf. Bred and raced by William R. Beasley, his sire was the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Round Table. His dam was Ratine, a daughter of Bahram, the Aga Khan's 1935 British Triple Crown champion. A successful sire of two British Classic winners, Bahram was purchased in 1940 by an American syndicate led by Alfred G. Vanderbilt II, who brought him to stand at stud in Maryland. 1966 He's a Smoothie was trained by the owner's son, Warren Beasley, who said, "I was listed as the trainer but Bobby (Bateman) was really the trainer."  Slow to develop, the colt did not race at age two. At age three, he earned his first win in May 1966 on the dirt at the Fort Erie Racetrack in Fort Erie, Ontario. He went on to win the Mohawk Handicap, the Fairbanks Handicap, the first of two straight Seagram Cup Handicaps, the  Valedictory Handicap at 1 miles, and a Canadian Classic, the  Prince of Wales Stakes.

Cristoforo Frangipani (Christoph Frankopan) (, ; 1482 – 22 September 1527) was a Croatian count from the noble House of Frankopan. As a supporter of King John I of Hungary during the succession crisis between John Zápolya and Ferdinand Habsburg, he was named the ban of Croatia in 1526, and died in battle fighting alongside supporters of Zápolya. Life  Frankopan was born in 1482, son of the Croatian nobleman Bernardin Frankopan (1452–1529), a loyal man to the King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary, and Luisa of Aragon. Decades later, after the death of the King Matthias, the Hungarian crown passed to the Polish-Lithuanian House of Jagiellon with Vladislas II of Hungary in 1490. Christoph grew loyal to the new King and decades later bravely fought against Venice and the Ottoman Empire under emperor Maximilian I and Louis II of Hungary (Vladislas II's son). In 1496, due to the Frankopan family's influence, Christoph's sister, Beatrice de Frangepan, was married by John Corvinus, the illegitimate son of the deceased King Matthias of Hungary. After the defeat of Hungary against Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Mohács (1526), the Hungarian throne again was empty with the death of Louis II. Immediately the Habsburgs reclaimed it for themselves, as a Hungarian Count, John Zápolya, also claimed his rights as husband of a Jagiellon princess.

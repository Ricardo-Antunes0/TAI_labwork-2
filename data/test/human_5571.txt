Tone Vale Hospital was a psychiatric hospital located approximately  to the north west of Norton Fitzwarren, near Taunton, Somerset, England, in what is now the village of Cotford St Luke.  It covered a large catchment area, with patients originating from places as far apart as Porlock (on the north western edge of Somerset) and Yeovil (on the south eastern edge). History Tone Vale was founded as the second Somerset County Asylum in 1892, the first Somerset County Asylum near Wells having become overcrowded. The competition to design the asylum was won by the architects Gile Gough and Trollope, and the first patient was admitted in May 1897. At that time the hospital was known as the Somerset and Bath Asylum, Cotford.  In 1986, under Margaret Thatcher's government, the Audit Commission published a report Making a Reality of Community Care,<ref>{{cite book | title=Making a Reality of Community Care |author= Audit Commission for Local Authorities in England and Wales | publisher= HMSO | year = 1986 |isbn= 978-0-11-701323-0}}</ref> which proposed the policy that became Care in the Community and led to a number of mental hospitals being closed in the United Kingdom.  In 1987, Tone Vale had 504 inpatients. In 1992, the number had reduced to 350, and in March 1994 to 117. The hospital closed in March 1995.

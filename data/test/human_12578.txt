Henry David Jocelyn, FBA, FAHA (1933–2000), commonly known as Harry Jocelyn, was an Australian Latinist and classical scholar. He was the Hulme Professor of Latin at the University of Manchester from 1973 to 1996. Early life and education  Born on 22 August 1933 at Bega, New South Wales, Jocelyn's father John Daniel Jocelyn was a police officer; both he and Jocelyn's mother Phyllis Irene (née Burton) were born in Australia, though John was descended from English migrants who settled in the goldfields and Phyllis from English and Irish convicts transported to Australia. In 1944 the family moved to a suburb of Sydney and Harry won a place at Canterbury Boys' High School two years later, where he enjoyed classics and ranked top of his year. From 1951, he read classics at the University of Sydney, graduating in 1955 with a first-class degree for which he received two university medals. Among his chief influences were G. P. Shipp, R. E. Smith, A. J. Dunston and A. H. McDonald. Supported by a travelling scholarship from Sydney, Jocelyn studied at St John's College, Cambridge (1955–57), completing part II of the classical tripos. He received the Sandys (1957) and Craven (1958) studentships from Cambridge and was student at the British School at Rome from 1957 to 1959. During that time, he completed doctoral studies at Cambridge under C. O. Brink. Among his other influences were Scevola Mariotti. His PhD was awarded in 1963.

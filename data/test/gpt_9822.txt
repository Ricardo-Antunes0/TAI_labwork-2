Mediolanum was a fort and small town in the Roman province of Britannia Inferior. The town is mentioned in the Notitia Dignitatum, and was probably abandoned in the late 4th century.  The fort was built on a promontory overlooking the River Whitchurch and probably served as a lookout point for Roman troops stationed in the area. The town probably grew up around the fort, and had a population of about 1,000 by the end of the 4th century.  The town's only remaining structure is a small church dedicated to Saint Martin. The church is currently under restoration, and is open to visitors from May to October.

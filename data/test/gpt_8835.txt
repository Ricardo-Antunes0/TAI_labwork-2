Swizzlewick was a twice weekly 1964 BBC Light Entertainment programme starring Dick Emery, Judy Loe and Kenneth Kendall.  Swizzlewick was a light-hearted and unpretentious programme that enjoyed its own in-jokes and idiosyncrasies. It ran for only two series, but its influence can still be felt today in programmes such as Never Mind the Buzzcocks.

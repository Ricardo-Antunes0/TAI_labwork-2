The Richmond Revolution was a professional indoor football team based in Richmond, Virginia that played in the Indoor Football League from 2010 to 2011. For the 2010 season, they played their home games at the Arthur Ashe Athletic Center.  Because of space issues at that facility the owner decided to move onto the SportsQuest campus in nearby Chesterfield for the 2011 season and play all home games outdoors, since the proposed arena had not yet been built. However, in late August, Richmond BizSense's writer Aaron Kremer (8/25/11) reported that Charlie Hildbold, the general manager, was laid off. He had moved to Virginia to help launch the indoor arena football team. According to Steve Burton, the owner of the team, Richmond Revolution will sit out the 2012 season and be reinstated in 2013. Scott Bass a writer for Style Weekly reported (3/9/2011) nearly half of the 40 players on the Raiders' training camp roster for 2011 defected from Richmond Revolution, as well as the Revolution's head coach, Steve Criswell. On February 9, 2012 the Virginia attorney general's office filed a civil suit against SportsQuest, the company that owns the Revolution.

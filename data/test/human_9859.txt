Ruby Mountain is a prominent  mountain summit located in the North Cascades Range of Washington state. It is situated in Ross Lake National Recreation Area which is part of the North Cascades National Park Complex. The Diablo Lake Overlook along the North Cascades Highway is at the foot of the mountain. The nearest higher peak is Colonial Peak,  to the southeast. Precipitation runoff on the east side of the mountain drains into Ross Lake via Ruby Creek, whereas the west side of the mountain drains into Diablo Lake via Thunder Creek. Climate Ruby Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below  or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

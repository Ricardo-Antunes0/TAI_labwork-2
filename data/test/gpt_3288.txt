Robert (Roy) Charles Geary (April 11, 1896 â€“ January 25, 1978) was an American astronomer who made important contributions to the understanding of binary and multiple stars, the solar system's asteroid belt, and the dynamics of galaxies.  Geary was born on April 11, 1896, in Brooklyn, New York. He received his bachelor's degree in 1921 from Brown University and his master's degree in 1922 from Harvard University. Geary began his career as an instructor at the University of Michigan in 1923. In 1926 he was appointed an assistant professor at Brown University and served in that position until 1931. Geary then became a professor at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, where he served until his retirement in 1965.  Geary made numerous important contributions to astronomy. His work on binary and multiple stars focused on the understanding of how these objects form and evolve. His work on the solar system's asteroid belt helped to clarify its origins and evolution. Geary also made important contributions to the theory of galaxy dynamics. He died on January 25, 1978, at the age of 81.

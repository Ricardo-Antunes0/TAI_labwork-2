Ben Affleck is an American actor and filmmaker. He made his film debut with a minor part for The Dark End of the Street (1981). He went on to appear in several television shows, including the PBS educational programs The Voyage of the Mimi (1984)  and The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988), and an episode of the ABC Afterschool Special in 1986. Affleck played an antisemite in the sports film School Ties (1992) and featured as a regular on the television drama Against the Grain (1993). He gained attention for playing the supporting part of a high-school senior in Richard Linklater's cult film Dazed and Confused (1993), after which he had his first leading role in Rich Wilkes's comedy Glory Daze (1995). In 1997, Affleck played a comics artist in Smith's art-house success Chasing Amy, and featured in and co-wrote the drama Good Will Hunting with Matt Damon. They won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He next starred with Bruce Willis in Michael Bay's $554 million-grossing science fiction film Armageddon (1998), which proved to be his biggest commercial success to that point. In 2000, Affleck formed a production company with Damon and Sean Bailey, named LivePlanet, which produced Project Greenlight (2001â€“05, 2015), a television series that provides training to first-time filmmakers. He has served as the executive producer of several projects directed by the winners of the show. Affleck played opposite Kate Beckinsale in Bay's war film Pearl Harbor (2001), which despite negative reviews was a box office hit. His career subsequently went through a period of decline when he starred in a series of critical and commercial failures, including the superhero film Daredevil (2003), and the comedies Gigli (2003) and Surviving Christmas (2004). He later made a comeback with the biopic Hollywoodland (2006), in which his portrayal of George Reeves earned him a Golden Globe nomination.

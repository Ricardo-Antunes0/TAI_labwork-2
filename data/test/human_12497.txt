Tamara Diane Wimer (born October 11, 1972), known professionally as Tamara Gee (formerly Isis Gee), is an American vocalist, songwriter, producer, arranger, dancer, and model.  She grew up singing and performing from the age of 5, and was a professional vocalist by the time she was 12 years old, winning various singing competitions throughout her adolescence and adulthood, as well as a beauty pageant.  Gee opened for vocalist Tony Bennett and his orchestra after being the featured vocalist on various albums throughout her teen years. She released her debut album Hidden Treasure with Universal Music in 2007, while living in Poland. Her single from the album, "For Life", was voted unanimous winner of Piosenka dla Europy, the Polish final for the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest. Tamara and her song "For Life" was the first Polish entry in history to qualify for the Eurovision final since the new rules were designed in the contest  and a French television commentator compared Gee's performance to Celine Dion. A portion of Gee's Eurovision performance was shown on The Oprah Winfrey Show on "The World's Got Talent" episode with Simon Cowell where Gee sang with former participants Celine Dion and Julio Iglesias. In 2007 Gee co-wrote and performed "Fate" on DJ Schiller's album Sehnsucht. The album went triple platinum and was nominated for a Grammy. She released her solo EP Christmas Angel in 2009.  On November 27, 2014, Tamara released a new highly anticipated album "Love, Tamara" of which she wrote with and was produced by Multi Grammy Award winning producer/songwriter Walter Afanasieff (Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, etc.).  She has been named the next Celine Dion. Gee is the co-founder, co-owner, co-creator, spokeswoman, and creative director of Nebu Milano, an Italian cosmetic brand launched in Milan on November 21, 2013.

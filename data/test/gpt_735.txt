Camp Seeley' was a United States Army training camp located in the town of Seeley, New York. It was opened in 1917 and closed in 1919.  The camp was established as a training ground for the 3rd Division of the American Expeditionary Forces, which was deployed to France during World War I. The camp was named for Major General John B. Seeley, who served as Chief of Staff of the American Expeditionary Forces from April to November 1917.   Camp Seeley was located on a site that is now part of the Town of Seeley. It consisted of two main sections: an assembly area and training ground. The assembly area consisted of barracks and other facilities, while the training ground housed rifle ranges, artillery ranges, and a cavalry range. The camp had a total authorized capacity of 4,000 officers and men, but only 2,500 men were garrisoned at any one time.   Camp Seeley ceased operations in 1919, following the end of World War I. The site was used for various purposes until the 1950s, when it became part of the United States Air Force Academy. The camp was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961.

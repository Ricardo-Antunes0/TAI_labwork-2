Lethal white syndrome (LWS), also called overo syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the OXTR gene. Affected individuals develop an exaggerated response to stress, leading to an increased risk of suicide and violence.  LWS was first described in 1984 by doctors at the University of Utah, who were investigating a cluster of suicides among young adults in the state. The syndrome is believed to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that both parents must carry the gene for their child to be affected. As of 2010, there was only one known case of LWS in the United States.  Affected individuals typically experience intense feelings of stress and anxiety that can lead to depression and suicidal thoughts. They also have a heightened response to violence and threats, which can make them more prone to assault and murder. LWS patients are also at risk for developing other psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  There is no known cure for LWS, but treatments include counseling and medication to manage the symptoms. In some cases, surgery may be needed to correct structural abnormalities in the brain caused by the syndrome.

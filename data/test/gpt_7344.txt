In 2002 the library became part of the Christchurch City Council and closed in 2005.  The library had a distinctive neo-Gothic design with a hipped roof, stained glass windows and carved stone details. It was situated on a prominent corner site at the top of Cathedral Square, and its imposing presence helped to create an early sense of community identity for the city. The library was extensively damaged by a devastating earthquake on 22 February 2011, but has since been rebuilt as an international heritage site.

The Indigo Book: An Open and Compatible Digital Library is a proposed open source, web-based digital library. The library would make available an unlimited number of books, articles, and other resources in any format. It would also allow users to create their own content and share it with others.  The Indigo Book was first proposed by the Open Library Project in December 2007. The Indigo Book project has since been renamed the Open Book Project. As of February 2013, the Open Book Project has over 70 contributors from around the world.  The Open Book Project is a collaborative effort to create a web-based digital library that makes available an unlimited number of books, articles, and other resources in any format. The library would also allow users to create their own content and share it with others. The project is divided into four stages: planning, development, testing, and launch.  The Open Book Project is currently in the planning stage. In this stage, contributors work on developing the project's infrastructure and concepts. Development focuses on creating a user interface and implementing features such as search and sharing. Testing is necessary to ensure that the library functions as intended and meets user expectations. Once the project reaches this stage, it will be ready for launch.

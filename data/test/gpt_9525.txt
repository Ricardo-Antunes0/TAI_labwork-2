Percy Goetschius (August 10, 1853 – October 9, 1916) was a German-born American ophthalmologist who is considered the father of modern cataract surgery.  Born in Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia), Goetschius emigrated to the United States with his family in 1868. After studying at various medical schools, he completed his medical training at the University of Pennsylvania in 1877. He then worked as an assistant to ophthalmologist Charles H. Greenough at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland.  In 1892, Goetschius developed a new technique for removing cataracts using a metal speculum and a hot gas. This procedure became known as "Goetschius extraction" and quickly became the standard for cataract surgery. He also developed a method for treating glaucoma using transthoracic surgery.  Goetschius served as president of the American Ophthalmological Association (AOA) from 1901 to 1902 and as president of the American College of Surgeons from 1903 to 1904. He was also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.  Goetschius died on October 9, 1916, in Baltimore after suffering a stroke. He was buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Baltimore.

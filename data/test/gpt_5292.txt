Marvin Sylvor (April 21, 1933 â€“ April 5, 1992) was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. He is generally considered one of the most important and influential tenor saxophonists in the history of jazz.  Born in Los Angeles, California, Sylvor played in a variety of ensembles as a youth, including bands led by Roy Haynes and Duke Ellington. He began his professional career in the early 1950s with the Woody Herman Orchestra. After a period with Stan Getz's quartet, he formed his own group in the early 1960s, which achieved critical and popular success with recordings such as "Avant Garde" (1968) and "Free Spirit" (1970). Sylvor also worked extensively as a session musician, contributing to recordings by Peggy Lee, Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, and Quincy Jones. He died of pneumonia at the age of 62 in 1992.  Sylvor's influence on later jazz saxophonists was profound and widespread. His playing was characterized by virtuosity and expressiveness, as well as an open-minded approach to improvisation. He is considered one of the architects of post-bop jazz.

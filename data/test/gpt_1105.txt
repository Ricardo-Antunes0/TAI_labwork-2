Langthwaite is one of the few villages in North Yorkshire, England, that has a population of only people.  Langthwaite is located in the Rosedale Valley, 10 miles northwest of Ripon and 4 miles southwest of Harrogate. The village is on the A684 road, midway between Ripon and York.  The name Langthwaite is thought to be derived from the Old English word "lang" meaning long and "thwaite" meaning a meadow or clearing. The village became a separate civil parish in 1866.  The old village centre is now a conservation area, and contains a number of listed buildings. The church, which dates from the 12th century, is situated next to the River Rosedale. There are also several old cottages, some dating from the 16th century. Langthwaite Hall, which was built in 1738 by the Duke of Richmond and Lennox, is now used as a hotel and restaurant.  Langthwaite has a population of just over 60 people. In recent years there has been a decline in population as many people have left for larger towns and cities. However, there are plans to revive the village by attracting new residents with new businesses and attractions.

Operation Unified Protector was a NATO operation in Libya, which began on 17 March 2011 and ended on 12 October 2011. The operation was conducted in support of the UN-backed government of National Transitional Council (NTC) leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil and was intended to protect civilians from attacks by the Libyan Army and Muammar Gaddafi's regime.  The operation began with a series of air strikes by NATO aircraft against military targets in Libya and lasted for more than a year and a half. During this time, NATO also deployed several thousand troops to support the NTC. The operation ended with the withdrawal of NATO forces in October 2011, following the NTC's assumption of full control over Libya.

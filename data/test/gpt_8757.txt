In 1932, brothers Alberto and Augusto Areti founded their first company, Areti Automobiles, in Bologna, Italy. The company specialized in the production of trucks and buses. In 1951, the company merged with another Italian automaker, Fiat Auto. The new company was renamed Areti-Fiat Auto.  In 1966, Alberto and Augusto's sons, Piero and Egidio, took over the company. They began to produce luxury sedans under the Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Maserati brands. Under the leadership of Piero and Egidio, the company grew rapidly and became one of Italy's leading automotive companies.  In 1993, Piero and Egidio's son Fernando took over the company. Fernando continued to grow the company by expanding into new markets including Russia and Eastern Europe. In 2000, Fernando acquired Chrysler Group's Italian operations, making ARETI one of the world's leading automotive groups.

Western supremacy: triumph of an idea? is a book about development studies, international relations and sociology written by award-winning Tunisian-born French historian, journalist, researcher, and feminist author Sophie Bessis. According to Italian political philosophy professor Flavia Monceri, Sophie Bessis shows how notions of the West have been used to justify imperial economic interests and the emergence of a free trade ideology.  Monceri contends that what is peculiar to the West is not the mere fact of a successful hegemony, but rather the fact that ‘the nations of the West … are the only ones to have produced a theoretical (philosophical, moral and scientific) apparatus to legitimate it’.  A notion of supremacy actually underpins the last 500 years of Western history and that it still does – for example, in the assumptions underlying notions such as human rights and modernization. Furthermore, the West is not yet able to give up the belief in its own superiority, despite the increasing opposite signs that indicate it's becoming more and more a particular civilization amongst many others.

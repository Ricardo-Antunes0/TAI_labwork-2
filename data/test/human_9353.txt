Algernon Cadwallader was an American emo and math rock band from Yardley, Pennsylvania. They were active from 2005 to 2012. Stereogum referred to the band as the "heroes of the emo revival". History Peter Helmis, Joe Reinhart, and Colin Mahony met in high school and formed the precursor to Algernon Cadwallader, Halfway to Holland, with their friend TJ DeBlois (drummer of metalcore band A Life Once Lost.) The lineup was Helmis and Reinhart on guitars with Mahony on bass and Helmis on vocals as well. Halfway to Holland differed from Algernon Cadwallader, with a heavier driving sound, more reverb on guitars and chords rounding out rhythm as opposed to the clean math rock riffs Algernon Cadwallader has become known for. While the band was short lived, it continues to have a cult following to this day. Helmis went on to various solo and duo acts, while Mahony and Reinhart formed another band, Like Lions, with fellow school mates. Reinhart and Mahony's collaboration with Like Lions was short lived due to musical differences, and subsequently reached out to Helmis and friend Nick Tazza (from Ape Up!) to form Algernon Cadwallader in 2005.

A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) is a type of polymer that is created by imprinting the structure of a polymer onto a surface molecule. MIPs are often used in electronics, biomedical applications, and other industries where a precise and controllable shape is desired.  MIPs are based on the principle of molecular self-assembly, which allows molecules to organize into complex structures without the need for external guidance. This process is achieved by injecting a specific set of monomers into a solvent, which then causes the molecules to interact with each other in order to form a desired structure. MIPs can be designed to have a variety of shapes and sizes, making them useful for a variety of applications.

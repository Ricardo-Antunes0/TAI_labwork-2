Queer Appalachia (also known as the Queer Appalachian Project) is a collective of writers, artists, activists, and organizers from the Appalachian region and the South at large.  Established in 2016 after the deaths of Bryn Kelly and Amanda Arkansassy Harris, Queer Appalachia distributes its art, writing, and other work through an Instagram account and a publication called Electric Dirt.  According to magazine Esquire, the collective "seeks to unify the queer people of Appalachia by capturing the variety of races, abilities, genders, religions, and addiction statuses of an area that is largely believed to be straight and white". Origins  Originally from a small town on the Virginia / Ohio border in rural Appalachia, HIV-positive transgender artist, writer, and musician Bryn Kelly became a zine enthusiast as a teenager.  At age 17 she published her first zine, Granny Witch Squares, which focused on the connections between the AIDS Quilt and Appalachian folk art.  She moved to Brooklyn to become a professional artist and activist, which gave her the opportunity to travel around the United States and interact with like minded individuals, including fellow Appalachians who chose to relocate.

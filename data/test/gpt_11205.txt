Jacob ben Solomon ibn Habib (Hebrew: יעקב בן שמולא הביבי, "Yaakov ben Shemuel ha-Babli", c. 1110 – 1185) was a Jewish philosopher and astronomer.  Jacob ibn Habib was born in Toledo, in the Muslim caliphate of Córdoba in al-Andalus (present-day Andalusia, southern Spain), to a Sephardic Jewish family. He learned Hebrew and philosophy from his father, Solomon ibn Habib, and studied astronomy with Abraham ibn Daud of Seville. He also studied mathematics with Raymond of Aguilers.   In 1116 or 1117, he moved to Jerusalem to become a Rabbi. He joined the Academy of Maimonides in 1124, taking the academic name "Ibn Habib". In 1141, he was appointed Rosh Yeshiva of the Jews' Quarter in Jerusalem.  He died on July 4 or 5, 1185 in Jerusalem. His tomb is located in the Old City's Western Wall Plaza.  Jacob ibn Habib is best known for his philosophical works on Judaism and Islamic theology. His most famous work is the "Mishneh Torah", a codification of Jewish law that is still used today. He also wrote extensively on Islamic theology, including a commentary on the Quran and a treatise on the nature of God.

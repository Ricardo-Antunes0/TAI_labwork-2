Exercise Grand Slam was an early major exercise fad in the United States. It was promoted by Robert Atkins in his book The New Atkins Diet and later popularized by Dr. Michael M. Epstein in his book The Exercise Prescription: A New Way to Keep Your Body Young.  The goal of the exercise grand slam is to complete a series of five major exercises each week. These exercises are:  1) aerobic exercise 2) resistance exercise 3) flexibility exercise 4) balance exercise 5) strength exercise

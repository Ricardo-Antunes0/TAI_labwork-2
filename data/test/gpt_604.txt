Kurt Paul Schmitt (7 October 1886 – 1 October 1963) was a German jurist and politician. As a member of the Nazi Party, he served as the Minister of Justice of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945.  Born in Vogelsberg, Schmitt attended the universities of Kiel, Göttingen and Freiburg. He became a professor at the University of Kiel in 1927, and concurrently served as a State Councillor in Schleswig-Holstein from 1928 to 1933. In 1933, Schmitt was appointed as the Minister of Justice in Adolf Hitler's cabinet. He played an important role in consolidating Nazi power and overseeing the persecution and extermination of Jews, Romani people and other groups that Hitler labelled as "undesirable". In 1945, Schmitt was captured by Allied forces and tried at Nuremberg for war crimes. He was sentenced to death, but he committed suicide before he could be executed.

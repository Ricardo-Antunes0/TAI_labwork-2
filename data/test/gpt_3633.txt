The Bugatti U-16 was a 16-cylinder water-cooled engine-powered racing car produced by the Bugatti company between 1934 and 1936.  The U-16 was designed by Jean Bugatti and built at the Bugatti factory in Molsheim, France. It was powered by a 16-cylinder engine which was based on the 8-cylinder engine used in the Bugatti Type 35 Grand Prix cars. The U-16 was raced in a number of races including the 1935 Monaco Grand Prix where it finished fifth.

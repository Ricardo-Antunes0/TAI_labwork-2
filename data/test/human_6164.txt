Léon Fiévez (30 April 1855 – 27 May 1939) was a Belgian official of the Congo Free State. While employed by the Congo Free State, Fiévez became notorious for his harsh methods of enforcing rubber production in his territory, included the wide-scale oppression and killing of local Congolese. Fiévez's actions accrued significant coverage in the foreign press, forcing his removal from office and return to Belgium. Biography  Fiévez was born to a farming family in Wallonia, Belgium. In 1888 he was recruited into the Force Publique, a military force formed to garrison Leopold II of Belgium's Congo Free State, arriving in the Congo in the town of Boma. Though the conquest of the Congo by the Belgians was well underway by 1888, Fievez quickly became noted as a particular effective soldier, successfully leading military expeditions in the upper Congo. In the late 1891 he was forced by illness to return to Belgium, but by 1893 had returned to the Congo. When the commissioner for the crown-controlled province of Équateur, former explorer Charles Lemaire, was wounded in 1893, colonial administrators (who had been dissatisfied with Lemaire's level of rubber production) replaced him with Fiévez.

Due South is a Canadian crime comedy-drama television series that originally aired on the CTV network in Canada from October 3, 2004, to May 17, 2007. Airing in the United States on the USA Network from January 14, 2005 to May 10, 2007, it is produced by Bell Media and Paramount Television.  The show follows the misadventures of police officers John Winchester (Josh Dallas) and Andy Quaid (Patrick Warburton) in their fictional Canadian town of Gooderham Bay, on the Gulf of Mexico. The show was created by David Milch and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer for CTV and Paramount Television.  The show was praised for its mixture of humor and drama, with reviewers citing its depiction of small-town life as well as its well-developed characters as particular strengths. However, owing to its high production costs and lack of a strong US viewership base, the show was cancelled after five seasons. A feature film adaptation was released in 2009.

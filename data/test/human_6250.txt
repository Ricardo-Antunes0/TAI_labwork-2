Totally Dance is an album in the Totally Hits series. This compilation is a departure from its Totally Hits parents as its main focus is on electronic dance music popular at the time instead of primarily pop hits. It is also the first compilation in the series to focus on a certain genre, before Totally R&B, Totally Hip Hop and the Totally Country series.

Jean-Luc Boulay (born 1955) is a French-born Canadian artist known for his paintings, sculptures and installations.  Boulay was born in 1955 in Paris, France. He immigrated to Canada in 1978 and has since lived in a number of cities, including Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. He is currently based in Toronto.  Boulay's work is typically characterised by its use of light and space, as well as its often conceptual approach. His paintings often depict scenes from nature or the human body, while his sculptures often rely on elements such as metal or wood. His installations often incorporate both traditional and nontraditional elements, such as video or sound.  Boulay has been the recipient of several awards, including the Governor General's Award for Visual and Media Arts in 2001 and the Prix de la Ville de Montr√©al in 2003. He was also the recipient of the 2010 David Zwirner Artist-in-Residence Award.

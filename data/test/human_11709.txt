The St. Petersburg paradox or St. Petersburg lottery is a paradox involving the game of flipping a coin where the expected payoff of the theoretical lottery game approaches infinity but nevertheless seems to be worth only a very small amount to the participants. The St. Petersburg paradox is a situation where a naive decision criterion which takes only the expected value into account predicts a course of action that presumably no actual person would be willing to take. It is related to probability and decision theory in economics. Several resolutions to the paradox have been proposed. The problem was invented by Nicolas Bernoulli, who stated it in a letter to Pierre Raymond de Montmort on September 9, 1713. However, the paradox takes its name from its analysis by Nicolas' cousin Daniel Bernoulli, one-time resident of the eponymous Russian city, who in 1738 published his thoughts about the problem in the Commentaries of the Imperial Academy of Science of Saint Petersburg.

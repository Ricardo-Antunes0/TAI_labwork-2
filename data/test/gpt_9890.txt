Lythrypnus is a genus of gobies native to the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean.  The genus Lythrypnus contains six recognized species: the common goby, L. vulgaris, the pygmy goby, L. minutus, the shortfinned goby, L. brevirostris, the longfinned goby, L. longirostris, and the oliveback goby, L. olivebacki. All six species are bottom-dwellers that inhabit water with a moderate to strong current. They are generally small gobies, ranging from 3 to 5 inches in length.   The common goby is the most widespread and common of the six species. It is a reddish brown color with a black stripe running along its back and a yellow belly. The pygmy goby is slightly smaller than the common goby and has a pale brown body with a black stripe on its back and a yellow belly. The shortfinned goby is the smallest of the six species and has a yellow body with dark spots on its head and body. The longfinned goby is the largest of the six species and has a dark brown body with light spots on its head and body. The oliveback goby is the only species that has an orange body color.

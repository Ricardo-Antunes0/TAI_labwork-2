The siege of Kamieniec Podolski (Polish: Oblężenie Kamienicy Podolskiej, German: Belagerung von Kamenz) was a military operation fought by the Russian army against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth forces in 1794. The Russians were seeking to capture the capital of the Commonwealth, Warsaw.  The siege lasted for several months and resulted in a Russian victory. It is considered one of the most significant battles of the French Revolutionary Wars.

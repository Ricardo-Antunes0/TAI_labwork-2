The Wasatch Stake Tabernacle  in Heber City, Utah, is the oldest ecclesiastical building in the state of Utah. It was built in 1848 and is the only Latter-day Saint meetinghouse that remains in use as a church building.  The tabernacle was built by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who were traveling in an oxcart from the Salt Lake Valley to Heber City. They arrived on July 24, 1848 and began work on the tabernacle that same day.  The tabernacle was originally built with four walls, a roof, and a door. The walls were made from local sandstone and were six feet high and eighteen feet wide. The roof was made from tarred hemp and had a diameter of twenty-two feet. A pulpit was placed in the center of the room and a piano was placed near the door.  In 1877, a small addition was made to the tabernacle which included a belfry and a bell tower. In 1938, an additional addition was made to the tabernacle which included an assembly hall. In 1966, an addition was made to the tabernacle which included conference rooms.  The Wasatch Stake Tabernacle is currently used for church services only. It is not open to the public.

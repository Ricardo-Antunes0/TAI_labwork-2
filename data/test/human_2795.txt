The game was first released on Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows and was ported to iOS and Android later. It was released onto Steam on the 17th of December 2015 after going through the Steam Greenlight process. The game received mixed reviews from users and video game reviewers, with the main downfalls mentioned the most being the “slippery controls” and the graphical design. Gameplay In SimplePlanes the player is given the freedom of building anything they want to create using the materials and objects provided, and players can additionally use XML modifications on their creation. Planes (or other creations) created by the community can also be downloaded from the SimplePlanes.com website. When the creation or build is finished, the player can fly/drive/sail it around the map which contains 5  different islands with unique features, (4 on IOS or Android) and/or upload it to the SimplePlanes website. The five islands each provide a different experience to the player, with interactive targets. Each island has a unique name, such as Maywar, Krakabola, Snowstone or Wright. The game also gives players the ability to build cars, boats, trains and mechanical objects. SimplePlanes contains challenges which the player can do. The challenges involve short tutorial-type activities (such as the "take-off tutorial" and the "landing tutorial") but can get more advanced with missions (such as "SAM Evasion" (a 4 stage level which gets increasingly difficult) and "Trench Run" (a race through a canyon-like area on the game map)> There are also weapons (bombs, wing guns and miniguns, missiles, rockets and torpedoes) in the game for the player to use on their creations.

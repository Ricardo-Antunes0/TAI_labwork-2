A number of aircraft have been claimed to be the fastest propeller-driven aircraft. The first propeller-driven aircraft to exceed the speed of sound was the German Heinkel He 178, which reached a speed of over 645 mph (1,050 km/h) during its maiden flight on 12 May 1935. The British Hawker Tempest, which first flew on 18 October 1938, also reached a speed of over 645 mph (1,050 km/h). The Soviet Buran shuttlecraft, which made three unmanned flights from Baikonur Cosmodrome to orbit and back in 1986 and 1987, was reportedly capable of reaching a speed of over 815 mph (1,400 km/h) in level flight.

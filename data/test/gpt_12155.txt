Moogerfooger is the trademark for a series of synthesizers created by Bob Moog in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The first Moogerfooger was the MF-1, released in 1969.  The Moogerfooger series featured many innovative features for its time, including a multimode filter with twelve resonance settings, a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), and a polyphonic keyboard. The MF-1 was followed by the MF-101 (released in 1970), the MF-102 (1971), the MF-103 (1972), and the MF-404 (1977). The MF-404 was the last model in the Moogerfooger series.

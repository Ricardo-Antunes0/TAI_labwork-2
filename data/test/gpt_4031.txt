The Yellow Oval Room is an oval-shaped room in the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham, England. It is used as a secure chamber for the Prime Minister and other high-ranking officials.  The Yellow Oval Room was first used in 1946, when it was used to transfer secret wartime messages between Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. The room has been used for confidential communications by successive British Prime Ministers since then. The room is often referred to informally as "The Cabinet Room", although its formal name is the Prime Minister's Office Conference Room.  The room is approximately 9 feet (2.7 m) wide by 15 feet (4.6 m) long, with a ceiling height of 7 feet (2.1 m). It has a fireplace, two sets of French doors that open onto a balcony overlooking the River Severn, and a desk and chairs for use by the Prime Minister and his or her advisers.

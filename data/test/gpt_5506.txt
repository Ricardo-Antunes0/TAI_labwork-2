The University of Padua (, UNIPD) is a public research university located in Padua, Italy. It was founded in 1222 and is the oldest university in Italy. The University of Padua has about 25,000 students and alumni and is a member of the European University Association and the International Alliance of Universities.  The University of Padua was founded in 1222 by a group of students and academics who left the University of Bologna after a dispute with the Bolognese academics. The first chancellor was Jacopo de' Barbari. In the early years of its existence, the University had little money and many students slept on the floors of the faculty buildings. However, over time it became one of Italy's most respected universities.  The University has produced many notable alumni, including Marco Polo, Antonio de Nebrija, and Galileo Galilei. In recent years it has made significant efforts to become more environmentally friendly, using solar power for some campus buildings and installing wind turbines to generate electricity.

The genus is named after the Ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes of Sinope, who is considered one of the founders of philosophy.  Diogenornis is an extinct genus of ratites, the only extant member being the emu. The ratites are a group of birds that includes the cassowaries, rheas, and emus. The ratites are characterised by their unusually large size and strong beaks and legs. They first evolved in the late Cretaceous period, about 100 million years ago.  Diogenornis was a large ratite, measuring up to 2.7 metres (8.9 feet) tall and weighing up to 220 kilograms (485 pounds). It had a long neck and a large head, which was heavily feathered. Its wings were small and its legs were strong and club-like. It fed on seeds and insects.  The fossil record of Diogenornis is limited, but it is thought to have existed for around 25 million years. It became extinct around 2 million years ago, due to competition from other animals and changes in the environment.

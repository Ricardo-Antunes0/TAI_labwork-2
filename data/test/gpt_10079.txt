Nepal Janabadi Morcha (lit. Nepal Democratic Front) is a political party in Nepal. The party was formed on 7 July 2006.  Nepal Janabadi Morcha is a democratic and secular party committed to the principles of democracy, human rights, women's rights and social justice. It advocates for the empowerment of the marginalized sections of Nepali society through equitable distribution of resources, development of grassroots democracy and promotion of social harmony. The party also believes in the importance of a strong national defence and is committed to safeguarding the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Nepal.  The Nepal Janabadi Morcha was founded on July 7, 2006 by Mohan Baidya and Kishor Mahara as a breakaway faction from the Nepali Congress. The party contested the 2008 legislative election as part of the United Democratic Front alliance, but failed to win a single seat. In 2010, the Nepal Janabadi Morcha joined forces with the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) and other left-wing parties to form the Madhesi Janabadi Morcha coalition for the parliamentary election that year. The alliance won 34 out of 75 seats in the House of Representatives, making it the largest opposition bloc. However, in May 2013, following disagreements over strategy within the alliance, Mohan Baidya left the party and formed his own faction, calling itself the National Democratic Front.

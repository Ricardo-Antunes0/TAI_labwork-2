Wikked Lil' Grrrls is Canadian singer Esthero's second album, her first full-length in seven years.  It was released on June 28, 2005 in North America by Reprise Records. The album elicited mixed reviews upon its release, with contemporary music critics generally praising her vocal performance but expressing mixed feelings regarding the record's eclecticism. The album gave Esthero her first album chart entry in the US, reaching number 24 on the US Heatseekers Albums chart. The album includes two singles, "We R in Need of a Musical Revolution" and "Fastlane." Background and recording Esthero was dropped from Work in late 1999 due to poor sales of her first album Breath from Another, and the label's absorption into Epic Records. She eventually signed with Reprise Records. Orlando Puerta, marketing director at Reprise Records noted: "Somehow she persevered, and she is special enough for us not to let go of her." Esthero began writing material for her second studio album before her departure from SME. It took over four years and in late 2003 she started recording sessions. In November 2004 a six-song promotional EP entitled We R in Need of a Musical Revolution was released. It features three tracks not included on the album: "The Lull-a-Bye", "I Drive Alone" and "Amber & Tiger's Eye".

Stewart-Jarrett left the show in the fourth episode of the fourth series when the character was killed off. Casting and character creation Casting for the part was announced on 17 August 2009 by Digital Spy. Stewart-Jarett went through an audition process for the part in which he commented on saying "I always thought your audition for drama school was meant to be the hardest you would ever do, but Misfits trumped that. I had to get through four auditions and five meetings before I got the part. The fourth audition was the worst. They placed around 20 of us in a house in Fitzrovia and we all had to work in groups so they could see the dynamics between us. We started in the morning and as the day wore on people were plucked out one by one and sent home. It was quite brutal". Fellow cast member Iwan Rheon revealed that Overman who created the character discussed how to write their parts with the cast and later began writing for them as actors. Stewart-Jarett added that Overman "gave us a licence to do that and it was actually quite nice in a way".

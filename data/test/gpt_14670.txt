757 Portlandia is a main-belt asteroid 32 km in diameter. It was discovered on October 3, 1892, by German amateur astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory, and named after the city of Portland, Oregon.  757 Portlandia is a carbonaceous C-type asteroid and member of the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the main-belt at a distance of 2.0–2.4 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,248 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.05 and an inclination of 5° with respect to the ecliptic.  757 Portlandia was first observed as a background asteroid by the Pan-STARRS survey in 2007. In March 2013, a rotational lightcurve was obtained from photometric observations by the NEOWISE mission, which gave a well-defined rotation period of 25.8 hours with a brightness variation of 0.42 magnitude ().

Pinus patula, commonly known as  patula pine, is a pine species in the Pinus genus. It is native to the eastern United States, from southern New Hampshire south to Florida, and west to eastern Texas. It grows in moist to wet soils, often near streams or other water sources.  Pine is a popular tree species for landscaping and forestry. It is a fast-growing tree, capable of reaching heights of 30–40 feet (9–12 m), with a trunk diameter of up to 2 feet (0.6 m). The wood is soft and weak, and is used for building purposes, furniture, and other objects. Pinus patula is also used as an agricultural crop, particularly for pulpwood production.

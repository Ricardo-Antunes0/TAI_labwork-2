Yan Fu (, IPA: ; courtesy name: Zhongshi) (born September 18, 1593, in the town of Zhaoqing, Henan province, China â€“ died May 26, 1662, in Beijing) was a Chinese poet and calligrapher of the late Ming Dynasty.  Born during the height of the Ming Dynasty, Yan Fu inherited a love for literature and poetry from his father. After spending several years in the imperial capital of Beijing during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor, he returned to his home province of Henan and devoted himself to poetry. He is credited with coining the term "shi" (poetry) and with popularizing the use of the ci (pen name) form in poetry.  Yan Fu's most famous work is the collection of poems known as The Wandering Scholar. He is also well-known for his calligraphy, which has been described as "beautiful and vigorous".

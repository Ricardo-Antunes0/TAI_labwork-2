Display behaviour is a set of ritualized behaviours exhibited by some animals in order to establish and maintain social hierarchies.   The display behaviour of an animal is often used to communicate information to other members of its species, such as dominance, submission, or reproductive status. Display behaviours can be performed individually or in groups, and can be performed at any time, including during predator or prey encounters.

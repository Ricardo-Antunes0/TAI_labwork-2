Drought tolerance is the ability to which a plant or organism survives and recovers from drought conditions. Plants and other organisms that are drought tolerant have been shown to have a greater chance of surviving and recovering from drought conditions than those that are not drought tolerant. There are many factors that contribute to drought tolerance, including the ability of the plant to reduce water loss, the ability of the plant to withstand desiccation (drying out), and the ability of the plant to synthesize new water- storage molecules.

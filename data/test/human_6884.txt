Callum "Halfway" Highway is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Tony Clay. He was introduced in the episode first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2018. Halfway is introduced as a friend of the Carter family, which was not publicised beforehand. Halfway is a comedic character who is jovial, dopey and "happy-go-lucky" who wears shabby clothing and beanie hats. Halfway's initial stint on the show focuses on his relationship with the Carter family and establishing a relationship with Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty). The actor was only contracted for two months and Halfway departs in the episode first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 16 February 2018. Afterwards, Clay was invited back to reprise his role and Halfway returns two months later after serving in the army. His experience in the army and his relationship with Whitney are explored upon his return. Producers introduced Halfway's brother, Stuart Highway (Ricky Champ); their relationship is initially portrayed as dark, but later becomes supportive. Clay's portrayal of Halfway has received a positive response from critics, with a Soaplife columnist describing him as "a welcome ray of sunshine in the bleak world of Albert Square", and Laura-Jayne Tyler of Inside Soap opining, "Square chiefs had clearly found a diamond in the rough with actor Tony Clay".

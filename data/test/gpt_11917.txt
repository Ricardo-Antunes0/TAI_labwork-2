Bernhard Christian Otto (6 March 1745 – 8 March 1814) was a German composer, conductor, and teacher.  Bernhard Christian Otto was born in Kassel, the son of the organist and composer Bernhard Otto. He studied music at the University of Königsberg and at the Royal Academy of Music in Berlin with Johann Stamitz. In 1768, he succeeded his father as organist of the University Church in Kassel.  Otto made his debut as a composer with the cantata "Gott erhalte uns vor dem Teufel" (God keep us from the Devil), which he wrote for the funeral of Prince-Elector Frederick II of Hesse-Kassel. His most successful work is the opera "Fidelio" (1782), which is still performed regularly.  Otto became director of the Royal Academy of Music in Berlin in 1800 and served in that capacity until his death. He also served as president of the Royal Academy of Music and Musiktheater Berlin from 1804 to 1814. Otto was a prolific teacher, most notably of Felix Mendelssohn.

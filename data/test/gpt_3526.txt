The Dingling  were ancient people who lived in what is now the United Kingdom. They are known from a few hundred surviving artefacts, including a type of bowl and a type of pottery.  The Dingling culture was first identified in 1967 by Professor Roy Strong, who named it after the town of Dingwall in Scotland. The Dingling people are thought to have been some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and their culture is considered to be one of the most important in pre-Roman Britain. Their artefacts date back to the late Bronze Age, and they are thought to have been influenced by the people living in present-day Denmark and Germany.  The Dingling culture is unique in that it is one of the few British cultures that has been extensively studied from an archaeological perspective. This has allowed researchers to learn a great deal about the way that this particular culture functioned and how it evolved over time. The Dingling culture is now considered to be an important part of British history, and its artifacts are regularly exhibited at museums around the country.

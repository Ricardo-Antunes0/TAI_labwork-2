The Düsseldorf Cow War   was a conflict between two groups of cows in the city of Düsseldorf, Germany. The war began in 2013 and ended in 2015.  The cows were fighting because they were both trying to get access to the same food source: the local cow patty restaurant. The restaurant was run by two rival groups of cows: the Blue and the Green cows. The Blue cows were supported by the city government, while the Green cows were supported by the cow patty restaurant's customers.  The war lasted for two years and resulted in numerous casualties. In the end, the Blue cows emerged victorious, and they now control the cow patty restaurant.

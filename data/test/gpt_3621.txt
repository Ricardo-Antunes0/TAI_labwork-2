Bolting is the production of a flowering plant through the process of pollination by a bee.   Bolting is an important process in horticulture, as it allows gardeners to produce cultivars of plants that are not possible to produce through other means, such as root division. It can also be used to create new cultivars from existing plants, or to cross different species of plants.

Eva Ring (1911–1989) was among the first, substantially few, female jockeys to ride and train winning race horses in Canada in the 1930s–1940s. It was a time in North American history when women were not permitted to obtain a jockey license or ride in flat races alongside their male counterparts, but Ring was a trailblazer and managed to overcome many of the obstacles of her time. Discrimination was not a situation unique to North America; rather, it was a global issue in the male dominated Sport of Kings.  To be able to ride, some women would show-up at the racetrack disguised as a male jockey. Ring's early photographs serve as a testament to her disguise.  Ring competed as a female jockey at venues where a jockey license was not required, such as bush track races, county fairs, and local recreational parks and exhibition centers where female jockeys were the exhibit. Some of those venues sported a grandstand and the semblance of a race oval but without a starting gate, such as the South Side Athletic Park in Edmonton. Ring was considered "well-known to horse and racing fans", and because of her outstanding riding abilities, was covered as a favorite in the Sports section of regional newspapers, such as the Edmonton Journal.

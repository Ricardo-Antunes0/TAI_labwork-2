Nonverbal autism is a subset of autism where the person does not learn how to speak. It is estimated that 25% to 50% of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) never develop spoken language beyond a few words or utterances. Background  Despite the growing field of research on ASD, there is not much information available pertaining to people with autism who never develop oral language; that, in fact, nonverbal autistic individuals are considered to be underrepresented in all of autism research. Because of the limited research on nonverbal autism, there are not many validated measurements appropriate for this population. For example, while they may be appropriate for younger children, they lack the validity for school children and have continued to be a roadblock for nonverbal autism research. Often in autism research, nonverbal autistic individuals are subgrouped with LFA, categorized by learning to make one sound or having minimal verbal language.

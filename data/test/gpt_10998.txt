LeVert was an American R&B vocal group. The group was composed of siblings Terrence, Toni, and Terry LeVert.  The group first achieved success in the late 1980s with their debut album "In the House", which yielded the hit single "I Want You (Hold Me Close)" and reached number four on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. They also scored a minor hit with their follow-up single, "Adventures in Love".  After releasing two further albums and appearing on several successful singles, including "Freakin' Out" and "I'll Be There for You", the group disbanded in 1995. However, they reunited in 2008 for a tour and have released one further album since then.

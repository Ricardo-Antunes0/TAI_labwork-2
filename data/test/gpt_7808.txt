Friedrich "Fritz" Szepan (2 September 1907 – 1 October 1978) was a German composer and conductor.  Born in Vienna into a musical family, Szepan studied with Arnold Schoenberg and Philipp Jarnach at the Vienna Academy of Music. After World War II, he worked as a conductor in various cities in East Germany, where he also taught at the Hochschule für Musik Berlin. He died in Berlin.  Szepan's compositions are characterized by their use of serialism and 12-tone technique, as well as an eclectic range that includes works for orchestra, chorus, solo instruments, and chamber music. His best-known work is the opera "Die Soldaten" (1960), which has been performed internationally.

The accession of Montenegro to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in March 2006 brought a new era of cooperation and stability to the country's relationship with its most important ally, NATO. Montenegro has been an ardent supporter of NATO since its inception, and has played an active role in the organization's military and infrastructure programs. The two countries have developed strong defense ties, and Montenegro has also been an important contributor to NATO's peacekeeping efforts. The alliance is also Montenegro's single most important economic partner, with bilateral trade totaling nearly $2 billion in 2015.     Montenegro is a member of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The country also participates in numerous international organizations dedicated to development, trade, tourism, and sport.     The Government of Montenegro maintains a diplomatic presence in more than 20 countries around the world.

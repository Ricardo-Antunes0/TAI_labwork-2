Trisha Baga (born 1985 Venice, Florida) is an American artist living and working in New York City. Her work is installation based and incorporates video, performance, and found objects. Career Beginning in 2012 Baga began to use 3D projectors and 3D glasses  for a more immersive effect as exhibited at West Street Gallery. In 2015 she added clay sculptures to her exhibitions, an outgrowth of  her involvement with the ceramics club, a loosely gathered group of artists who meet at Greenwich House Pottery. Some of her earlier works, such as Madonna y El Niño (2010–2011) involved Baga performing in front of and along with her projections, but by her 2012-13 solo exhibition Plymouth Rock 2 at the Whitney Museum of American Art, she began using found objects  (sometimes altered—as with a boom box painted with textured paint) in front of her projections in installations where she viewed "all things in the projection as bodies," preferring the "natural frequency" and one-sided/directional qualities of existing objects over the self-contained nature of sculpture. Her Solo exhibitions include: Orlando at Greene Naftali, New York (2015); Gravity at Peep-Hole, Milan (2013); Florida at  Société, Berlin (2013); Plymouth Rock 2 at Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (2012); and The Biggest Circle at Greene Naftali, New York (2011). Her work is  collected internationally and is in the permanent collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. She has received a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award (2012).

Health, according to World Health Organization (WHO), is the state of being physically and mentally healthy. It is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.  Nigeria is one of the most populous countries in Africa with a population of over 170 million people. The health status of Nigerians has improved since 1990 when the country's population was estimated at 108 million. However, Nigeria still ranks as one of the poorest countries in the world in terms of life expectancy and health indicators.   The main causes of death in Nigeria are diseases such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diarrhoea. Other major causes of death include road accidents, malnutrition, and violence. The prevalence of some diseases is increasing while others are decreasing due to increased access to healthcare facilities, better hygiene practices, and better nutrition.   Nigeria faces many health challenges including a high incidence of HIV/Aids, malaria, and tuberculosis. There is also a high infant mortality rate (IMR), which is largely due to poor maternal health and lack of access to quality healthcare services. Nigeria has made progress in narrowing the gender gap in terms of life expectancy but there is still a long way to go. In 2012, the IMR for women was 54 per 1 000 live births while for men it was 37 per 1 000 live births.   Nigeria has made significant progress in terms of public health infrastructure and programmes but much more needs to be done

Lady Eleanor Grey (died before December 1503), was the only child of King Henry VII of England and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon. She was born at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich, London.     In February 1509, when only eleven years old, she was betrothed to Arthur, Prince of Wales, eldest son of King Henry VIII. The following year, on 6 January 1510, the marriage took place in a secret ceremony at Hampton Court Palace. The marriage was annulled nine days later on 11 January 1510 on the grounds that Catherine had not yet consummated the marriage.     On 30 January 1511, she married Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk. From this union, she had five children: Edward Tudor (1512-1553), Lady Jane Grey (1537-1554), Lady Mary Tudor (1516-1558), Lady Catherine Parr (1513-1548) and Lady Anne Boleyn ( 1507-1536).  Eleanor was an intelligent and accomplished woman who exercised considerable influence over her husband and her children. She served as regent during the minority of her son Edward and was responsible for the upbringing of her daughter Jane Grey. She was beheaded in 1536 after a failed attempt to overthrow King Henry VIII and restore her daughter to the throne.

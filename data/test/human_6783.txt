Pikin Santi, sometimes spelt as Pikien Santi, is a Ndyuka village on the Cottica River in Suriname inhabited by the Pinasi and Piika lo. Pikin Santi is situated upstream from Pinatjaimi and Lantiwei, and downstream from Tamarin. It lies in the vicinity of the Buku creek and should therefore be close to the ruins , which as of yet have not been identified. History  Like all Ndyuka villages in the Cottica River area, Pikin Santi was settled somewhere in the early 19th century, when the peace treaty concluded between the Ndyuka and the Dutch colonial authorities in 1760 allowed Maroons to move to the plantation colony without running the risk of being caught by colonial military forces. The Ndyuka settled logging camps in the Cottica area, and lived off the profits of selling wood. The people of Pikin Santi belong to the matrilineal clans or lo of Pinasi and Piika, which are both members of the Mi√°fiyabakaa federation, and originally stem from the Aduwataa area on the Tapanahony River.

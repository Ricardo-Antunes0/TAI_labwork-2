Paul Wilson Brooks (28 May 1921 â€“ 26 January 1946) was an English cricketer. Brooks was a left-handed batsman who bowled left-arm fast-medium. The son of William James Brooks and Mabel Brooks, he was born at Marylebone, London. Prior to appearing in first-class cricket, Wilson had played Second XI cricket for Middlesex, and on one notable occasion he bowled the Australian Don Bradman in a practice session at Lord's before the 1938 season began, making him a celebrity for a short time. The following year he made what was to be his only first-class appearance for Middlesex against Warwickshire in the County Championship at Lord's. This was the final first-class match played by Middlesex that season, and Brooks was drafted into the team after a number of regular players had been drafted into the armed services due to rising tensions with Germany. In a match which Middlesex won by an innings and 200 runs, Brooks batted once, scoring an unbeaten 44.

Ellen Powell Tiberino (1937 – February 28, 1992) was an artist who infused works in the figurative tradition with an African American spirit. Themes to which she frequently returned in her work include African American life and history, and portrayals of girls and women in life situations such as pregnancy and motherhood. She exhibited widely in both Philadelphia and New York. Her drawings and paintings are held the Philadelphia Museum of Art, among others. Museum director Anne d'Harnoncourt particularly admired Powell Tiberino's ability to convey character and her use of line, describing it as "alive and forceful". Powell Tiberino has been acclaimed as Philadelphia's "premier African-American woman artist". Biography Ellen Powell was the daughter of William and Queenie Powell, Baptist sharecroppers who moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from Cape Charles, Virginia in 1937, just a few weeks before Ellen was born. At 12, Ellen converted to Catholicism. She attended Overbrook High School, and then went to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1956–1961). She was the second black woman to receive a Cresson Traveling Scholarship, in 1959, which she used to travel in Europe. She lived in New York City for the next six years.

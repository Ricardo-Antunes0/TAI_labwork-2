Sahara Blue is a 1992 concept album by the British rock band Yes. The album is a collaboration between Yes and Brian Eno, and is their first joint venture.  The album was recorded over a six-week period at AIR Studios in London, England. The sessions were plagued by problems, including the death of drummer Alan White and keyboardist Rick Wakeman's battle with leukemia. Nevertheless, the album was finished in time for its November 1992 release.  Sahara Blue received mixed reviews from music critics. Some praised the album's experimental nature and Eno's production, while others found it uninspired and overwrought. Nevertheless, it reached number eight on the UK Albums Chart and has since been certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry.  Yes released their seventh studio album, Owner of a Lonely Heart in 2012.

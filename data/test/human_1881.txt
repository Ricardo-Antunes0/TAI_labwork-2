KAAA (1230 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a News Talk Information format, licensed to Kingman, Arizona, United States. The station is currently owned by Cameron Broadcasting, Inc. and forms a full-time simulcast with KZZZ in Bullhead City. The stations feature programming from Fox News, Premiere Networks, Westwood One and Salem Radio Network among others. History KGAN signed on October 7, 1949. It broadcast with 250 watts on 1230Â kHz. The station, an ABC affiliate, was sold in early 1956 by original owner J. James Glancy to Wallace Stone and John F. Holbrook for $25,000; the new owners changed the call letters to the present KAAA on February 19, 1956. Stone bought out Holbrook two years later, and in 1963, the station was authorized to increase daytime power to 1,000 watts. Stone sold KAAA in 1971 for $225,000 to Sun Mountain Broadcasting, the principals of which included an FM station applicant in Lake Havasu City and a station salesman. Under Sun Mountain, a companion FM station, KZZZ 92.7 (now KFLG-FM 94.7), was launched. By the time KAAA-KZZZ was sold to Mohave Sun Broadcasting in 1981, KAAA broadcast a mixed Top 40-country format.

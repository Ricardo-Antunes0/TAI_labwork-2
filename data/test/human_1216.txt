Shanti  is an Indian Kannada language film directed by Baraguru Ramachandrappa. The film features only a single actor (Bhavana) and hence has found an entry in the Guinness World Records in the category "Fewest actors in a narrative film". Theme Baraguru Ramachandrappa decided to direct this film to portray different faces of peace by juxtaposing symbolism and monologues. The main theme of the film is to explore the various ways to fight terrorism without any compromise with the human values promoted by the United Nations. The UN was used as a vital aspect in the film since Baragur feels that it is a world body that has created two contradicting influences of war and peace. Baragur indicates that though this was sort of an experiment, experimentation was not the main motivation for producing this film. Rather than the concept, more focus has been given on the creative aspects of the theme. A female character was chosen as the sole actress in the film since peace is generally considered feminine whereas war is more masculine. The film does not end with a moral, something uncommon among Indian movies. This is because Baraguru wanted the audience to start off a discussion to weigh the pros and cons of war against peace.

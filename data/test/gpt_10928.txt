McLean's Mansion (originally Holly Lea) is a historic mansion located at 6200 Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, D.C. The mansion was built in 1878 for banker and financier Archibald McLean, who later became the head of the powerful J. P. Morgan banking empire.  The mansion has been the residence of numerous members of the American political and social elite, including Ulysses S. Grant, Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. It served as the official residence of the first lady during the administration of Eleanor Roosevelt, and was also the home of Joseph Kennedy, Jr., when he was assassinated in 1963.  Today, McLean's Mansion is a museum operated by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. It is open to the public daily from 9:00am to 5:00pm.

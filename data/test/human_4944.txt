The Rawlett School is a secondary school with academy status located on the outskirts of Tamworth, a market town in Staffordshire, England. It was previously known as Rawlett Community Sports College and, before that, as Rawlett High School. The school is sponsored by the Academies Enterprise Trust. Rawlett educates around 1,250 students aged 11â€“16. The headteacher is Heather McLachlan. The catchment includes Tamworth, Fazeley, Mile Oak, Elford, Hopwas, Riverside, Coton Green and Gillway. History  The school was officially opened in September 1980, by local Councillor Arnold Ward. In 1983 the school merged with the soon to be closed Perrycroft Girls' school and for some of that academic year operated as a split site. By 1985 all 5 year groups were full and the sixth form was becoming established. Four Houses were set up, Grosvenor, Weymouth, Townshend and Wolferstan, named after historically prominent Tamworth families and landowners. In 1999 a fifth House - Peel - was established. Following the loss of the sixth form in 2012 (a Sixth form College was built in Tamworth by Landau Forte Academy) the school reverted to four Houses and Grosvenor ceased to exist. In Jan 2018 the school was criticised by many (including parents) for the introduction of rules for maximum nail length for students.

Emanuel "Manny" Steward (July 7, 1944 – October 11, 2017) was an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He was the founder of the E Street Band and its lead singer from 1973 to 1985.  Steward was born in Bayonne, New Jersey to a Jewish family. He grew up in Asbury Park and played guitar in local bands before forming the E Street Band in 1973 with his brothers-in-law Mike Campbell, Phil Collen and John "J.D." Geils. The band rose to fame in the early 1970s with their blues-infused rock sound and their songs about social issues such as poverty, racism and the Vietnam War. They became one of the most popular hard rock groups of all time, with sold-out tours throughout the world. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. Steward retired from performing in 1985 but continued to produce and work on E Street Band recordings until his death from cancer in 2017 at the age of 71.

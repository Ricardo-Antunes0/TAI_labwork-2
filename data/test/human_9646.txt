Glenn Rhee is a fictional character from the comic book series The Walking Dead, in which he is known simply as Glenn. He was portrayed by Steven Yeun in the television series of the same name and voiced by Nick Herman in the video game of the same name. In both forms of media, Glenn is a young pizza delivery boy from Atlanta (although in the television series it's stated that he's originally from Yeun's home state, Michigan) who is separated from his family after the zombie outbreak and joins a group of survivors led by Rick Grimes. Glenn is known for being quick thinking and resourceful, which makes him the group's primary supply runner. As the group begins to move around the region looking for sanctuary, Glenn meets Maggie Greene and they fall in love. Their relationship is tested in numerous ways throughout the course of the series as their humanity is challenged in the face of numerous threats, including hostile survivors the group comes into contact with. They eventually marry and have a child, although Glenn is killed by Negan before the child is born.

A Frost diagram or Frostâ€“Ebsworth diagram is a graphical depiction of the thermodynamic state of a system, usually in terms of the energy levels of its constituent atoms or molecules. The diagram is named after the British physical chemist Lawrence Frost and American chemist Robert E. Ebsworth. The diagram is also known as a Venn diagram, after the British scientist John Venn.  Frost diagrams are commonly used to understand the principles of thermodynamics and chemistry. They can be used to show how molecules interact with each other, how heat is transferred between different parts of a system, and how chemical reactions take place.  A Frost diagram can be created by taking the energy levels of the atoms or molecules in a system and plotting them on a graph. The x-axis shows the energy level, while the y-axis shows the number of particles in that level. The horizontal line at the bottom of the diagram shows the total energy in the system.  Frost diagrams are often used to show how different substances interact with each other. For example, on a Frost diagram showing how water vapor interacts with air, water vapor will be at the top of the diagram, while air will be at the bottom. This is because water vapor has a higher energy level than air, and therefore forms larger molecules that can hold more energy. As these molecules interact with each other, they move down the diagram until they reach air, which has a lower energy level and is therefore displaced.

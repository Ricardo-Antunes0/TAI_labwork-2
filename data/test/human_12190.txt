Veneto State (Veneto Stato, VS) was a Venetist political party active in Veneto and eastern Lombardy. The party's goal to achieve full political independence for the former territories of the Venetian Republic from Italy through a referendum. VS had a handful of municipal councillors and was once represented in the Regional Council of Veneto. After the exit of the libertarian faction led by Lodovico Pizzati, Paolo Bernardini and Gianluca Busato in December 2011 and the formation of Venetian Independence in May 2012, VS was seen as the communitarian wing of the Venetian independence movement. The party was also influenced by Christian democracy and social democracy. Both its latest secretary, Antonio Guadagnini, and its former president, Giustino Cherubin, were former Christian Democrats. VS had close ties with Independentist Youth, the Venetians Movement, and, strangely enough, the Libertarian Movement. At the European level, VS cooperated with the European Partnership for Independence and the International Commission of European Citizens.

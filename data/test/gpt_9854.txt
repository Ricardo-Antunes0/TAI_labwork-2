The word Maharashtra, the land of the Maharashtrians, derives from the ancient Marathi term mahratta, which means "one who resides in the middle of the land". The name Maharashtra is believed to have originated from the words mahara (in local parlance, a term for a small island in a river) and ata (meaning "middle"). The region now known as Maharashtra was first inhabited around 100 BCE by the Satavahanas. The Deccan was ruled by the Chalukyas and then by the Rashtrakutas. Finally, the Yadava dynasty of Devagiri took control of the region in the 12th century. In 1536, Mughal emperor Babur defeated Ibrahim Shah of the Gujarat Sultanate and annexed much of present-day Maharashtra. In the 17th century, Maratha warriors under Shivaji conquered most of present-day Maharashtra, extending their rule over an area that reached from Bangalore in the south to North Kanara in the north. In 1818, British administrator Sir Charles Metcalfe declared this region a part of the Bombay Presidency. In 1948, with the independence of India, Maharashtra became a state within the new Indian federation.  Maharashtra is bounded by Gujarat to the northwest, Madhya Pradesh to the north and east, Chhattisgarh and Telangana to the southeast, Karnataka to the south and southwest and Andhra Pradesh to the west. The region is about 1,600 km (1,000 mi)

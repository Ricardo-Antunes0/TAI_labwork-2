Indo-Fijians or Indian-Fijians (also known as Fiji Indians) are people of Fijian descent with at least partial South Asian heritage, including descendants who trace their heritage from various regions of the Indian subcontinent. Although Indo-Fijians constituted a majority of Fiji's population from 1956 through the late 1980s, discrimination and the resulting brain drain resulted in them numbering 313,798 (37.6%) (2007 census) out of a total of 827,900 people living in :Fiji . The term Indo-Fijians refers to the Indian subcontinent, not only modern day India, formally the Republic of India. Although they hailed from various regions in the Indian subcontinent, the vast majority of Indo-Fijians trace their origins to the area of modern-day Bihar and South India. The major home districts of Fiji's North Indian labourers were Basti, Gonda, Faizabad, Sultanpur and Azamgarh, in the present-day Awadh region of Uttar Pradesh and the present-day Bhojpur region of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Others (in a smaller quantity) originated in the Tamil and Telugu regions of the Madras Presidency and free immigrants came from Gujarat. Many of the Muslim Indo-Fijians also came from Sindh and Balochistan and various other parts of South Asia and speak the Urdu language. Fiji's British colonial rulers brought Indian people to the Colony of Fiji as indentured labourers between 1879 and 1916 to work on Fiji's sugar-cane plantations.

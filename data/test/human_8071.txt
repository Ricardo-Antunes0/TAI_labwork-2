Vinita Vasu is a self-taught woman visual artist and designer in Delhi, India. She directed a short film, Beaming Blossom which, at the  Children's International Cine Festival in 2016, won a 'Special Festival Mention Award'. Introduction In a career spanning over a decade, Vasu has worked in paint and  varied media. She paints on walls, on fabrics, on canvas, paper, fiber-glass, on bottles and boards, and even on pebbles and stones. Born in Kerala, and brought up in Delhi, â€“ Vasu won all the art competitions she participated in, during her school years. However she could not pursue a degree in fine art education. Her untrained expression also lends her art a distinctive freshness and purity. As Vasu herself explains: "In my works colours, shapes and patterns are used to celebrate the journey of life." Each of her creations emerges from the depths of her soul, her inner consciousness. "Although my consciousness is the fundamental source of all my creations, it reflects the phenomenal visual experience of body, mind and soul."

Robert Erwin Johnson (3 February 1923 â€“ 17 November 2009) was an American musician and singer-songwriter. He is best known as the lead singer and songwriter of the rock and roll group The Beatles. Johnson also composed "I Want To Hold Your Hand" and other well-known songs for the Beatles.  Johnson was born in Harlem, New York City, to a poor family of farmers. He began playing the guitar at age six, influenced by country music and blues. Johnson attended Hackensack High School in New Jersey, where he met John Lennon and George Harrison. The three formed a band in early 1941 and were soon performing around Liverpool. After two appearances on BBC radio, the group signed with Parlophone Records in England in February 1962.  The Beatles achieved worldwide fame during the 1960s with their original lineup of John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. After the band's break-up in 1970, Johnson pursued a solo career. His most successful songs include "Hey Jude" (1968), "Let It Be" (1970), "The Pretender" (1972), "You Can't Do That" (1978), "I Feel Fine" (1979), "Helter Skelter" (1969) and "The Lady Is a Tramp" (1955).

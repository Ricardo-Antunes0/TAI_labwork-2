James "Jimmy" McClellan Boal (â€“1862) was an American journalist and author, who was best known for his abolitionist writing.  Born in Charleston, South Carolina, Boal attended the prestigious Transylvania University where he studied law. He soon abandoned his plans to practice law and instead became a journalist, working first for "The Liberator" and then "The National Era". In 1848, he moved to New York City and worked as a correspondent for "The New York Times".  In 1851, Boal co-founded the weekly abolitionist newspaper "The Liberator". He remained its editor-in-chief until 1861, when he was forced to flee the Union Army during the American Civil War. After the war, Boal returned to "The Liberator", but died a few months later in 1862.  Boal is best known for his writings on the American Civil War, which covered a wide range of topics from military strategy to African American history. He is also remembered for his humorous writing style and his advocacy for free speech and free press rights.

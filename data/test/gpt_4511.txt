Al-Mansur al-Husayn (1669â€“1720) was an Imam over Shi'ite Muslims from the Safavid dynasty. He was the third son of the Safavid shah Abbas I and succeeded his father in 1705. After reigning for eleven years, he was killed by a rival faction at the Battle of Karbala in 1720.  Al-Mansur al-Husayn is considered one of the most influential figures in Shi'ite history. He is especially venerated for his role in leading Shi'ites during their revival after centuries of decline, and for his actions during the Battle of Karbala, which is considered one of the most important events in Shi'ite theology.

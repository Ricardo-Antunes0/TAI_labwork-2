Julian Pender Hume (born 3 March 1960) is an English palaeontologist, artist and writer who lives in Wickham, Hampshire. He was born in Ashford, Kent, and grew up in Portsmouth, England. He attended Crookhorn Comprehensive School between 1971 and 1976. His career began as an artist, specialising in the reconstruction of extinct species, after which he undertook a degree in palaeontology at the University of Portsmouth, followed by a PhD in the same subject, jointly hosted by the University of Portsmouth and the Natural History Museum, London and Tring. He is presently a Research Associate at the Natural History Museum, and has travelled extensively, working on fossil excavations that include the Cape Verde Islands; Lord Howe Island, Tasmania, Flinders, King and Kangaroo Islands, Australia; Madagascar, Seychelles, and Hawaiian Islands. However, his main area of research is the Mascarene Islands of Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues, where in particular he has studied the history of the dodo (Raphus cucullatus). He has contributed both scientifically and artistically to a large number of palaeontological papers, and described seven new species of extinct bird from the islands, with at least five more awaiting description. He has also written popular books and magazine articles, and published a critically acclaimed book 'Lost Land of the Dodo,' co-authored with Anthony Cheke, on the subject of extinct Mascarene species. His other books include ‘Extinct Birds of Hawaii’ published in 2016 with Michael Walther, which includes his own artwork for all fossil species. His latest book, which also includes his own artwork, is the second edition of the book entitled 'Extinct Birds', published in September 2017; the first edition was co-authored with Michael P. Walters and published February 2012. A third edition is currently in preparation.

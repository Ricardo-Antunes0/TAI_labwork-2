Circus music (also known as carnival music) is a genre of music associated with circuses and carnivals. It is typically an upbeat genre, characterized by circus-style percussion instruments such as tambourines, cymbals, and bells, and by lively, sing-along melodies.  Circus music has been part of human culture for centuries, and it is often used to entertain audiences during carnivals and other events. It is also popular among circus performers themselves, who often use it to energize their performances.

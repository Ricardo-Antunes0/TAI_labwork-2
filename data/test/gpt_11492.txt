Sunspottery was a pejorative term assigned to a group of painters active in Rome in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, who were characterized as frivolous and superficial.  The term "sunspottery" was first used by Giorgio Vasari in his 1550 book Le Vite de' pi√π eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori, where he describes a group of Roman painters that he refers to as "gaudiosi e superficiali". Vasari used the term to criticize these artists for their lack of skill and their tendency to focus on trivial subjects. He claimed that they were unable to produce any truly great works of art.  The term "sunspottery" was later adopted by other historians and critics to refer to a group of artists who were considered to be lightweight and superficial. This term was often used to compare these artists with the more accomplished painters of the Renaissance period.  Sunspottery is no longer commonly used to refer to a specific group of artists, but it remains an apt description for a group that was considered frivolous and superficial by many critics.

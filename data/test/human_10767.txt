is a Japanese anime television series centered around the mostly female crew of a commercial Warship, the Pascal Magi, which is trying to fight pirates in the near future. The series is mix of serious combat, political intrigue, light romance, and comedy, a classic story of the underdogs trying prove their worth amidst superior enemies, and doubtful arrogant allies. The series was produced with mix of traditional and computer generated animation. This was an anime produced with cooperation from the Japanese Self-Defense Force (JSDF) during a period that there was no collaboration between anime producers and fandoms of similar types of anime. The show was broadcast on TV Kanagawa, Chiba TV, TV Saitama, TV Aichi, Sun TV and KBS Kyoto. Reportedly, the Pascal Magi was based on the Murasame-class destroyer, and the ship in the show was given a designation with the consent of the JSDF, which the producers worked with to create realistic battle scenes and models for the anime. The theme song, ending theme, and background music for the show were created by Lantis Co., Ltd.

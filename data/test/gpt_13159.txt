Caladenia aperta, commonly known as the western spider orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia.  The western spider orchid is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single green leaf with a red stripe along its length. Up to three green and yellow flowers with a black spider on their labellum are borne on a spike above the leaf. The flowers are self-fertile and open during the day.  The western spider orchid was first formally described by John Lindley in 1839 and the description was published in "A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony". The specific epithet ("aperta") is from the Latin words "a - open" and "pater" meaning "father".  The western spider orchid is found in the south-west of Western Australia between Mount Babbage and Albany where it grows in sandy soils.

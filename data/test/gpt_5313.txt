In mathematics, the Pfeffer integral is an integral operator that is named after Johann Pfeffer. It is a generalization of the absolute value function and the elliptic integral, and is used in various areas such as mathematical physics, fluid dynamics, and seismology.  The Pfeffer integral is defined on a closed interval [a, b] as:  where "I" is the Pfeffer integral operator, "f" is a continuous function on [a, b], and "x" is an arbitrary point within [a, b]. The integral can be written as:  where "S" is a closed surface in [a, b], and "E" is the elliptic integral with domain [a, b] and range [c, d]. The Pfeffer integral converges monotonically to zero on E as "x" approaches "c", and diverges to infinity on E as "x" approaches "d".

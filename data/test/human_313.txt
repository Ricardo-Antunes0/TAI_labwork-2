Oleg Vladimirovich Deripaska (; born 2 January 1968) is a Russian oligarch and industrialist. He is the founder of Basic Element, one of Russia's largest industrial groups, and Volnoe Delo, Russia's largest charitable foundation. Until 2018, he was the president of En+ Group, a Russian energy company, and until 2018 headed United Company Rusal, the second-largest aluminium company in the world. Deripaska enriched himself on previously state-owned assets that were privatized in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union. He has been characterized as a victor in the "aluminium wars" in Russia during the 1990s, which were frequently violent conflicts between businesspeople to obtain state-owned assets. In 2000, Deripaska founded Rusal, the result of a partnership between Sibirsky Aluminium and Roman Abramovich's Millhouse Capital. In 2007, Rusal merged with SUAL Group and Glencore International AG to form UC Rusal, with Deripaska as chairman.  	 He was once Russia's richest man, but lost a substantial part of his fortune amid the 2007â€“08 financial crisis. As of November 2021, his wealth was estimated by Forbes at $4.1 billion and the 775th richest person in the world. Deripaska bought himself Cypriot citizenship in 2017. As part of a public relations campaign, he said in April 2021 that Rosstat (Federal State Statistics Service) data showing that there are 17.8 million poor people living below the country's subsistence minimum was wrong, and that the correct number was about 80 million.

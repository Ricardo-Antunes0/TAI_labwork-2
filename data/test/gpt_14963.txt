Caspase-1/Interleukin-1 converting enzyme (ICE) is an evolutionarily conserved protein found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is a member of the caspase family of enzymes, which are responsible for the apoptosis (or programmed cell death) of cells.  The caspase-1 gene is located on the short arm of the human chromosome 16, and encodes a protein of 471 amino acids. The caspase-1 protein is a heterotetramer composed of two alpha subunits and two beta subunits. The alpha subunit contains the active site of the enzyme, while the beta subunit is responsible for its substrate binding and catalysis. The caspase-1 gene is expressed predominantly in cells that undergo apoptosis, such as lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and pancreatic cancer cells.  The caspase-1 enzyme plays an important role in the apoptotic process. In apoptosis, the cell undergoes a series of events that lead to its death. The first step in apoptosis is the activation of caspases, which are enzymes that catalyze the cleavage of proteins. The caspases then cleave other proteins, such as the DNA molecule, leading to the death of the cell.  The caspase-1 enzyme is responsible for the activation of other caspases, such as caspase-3 and caspase-7. Caspase-1 also plays a role in the promotion of apoptosis by medi

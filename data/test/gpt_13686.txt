An autotroph or primary producer is an organism that derives its energy from photosynthesis, the process that converts light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose by photosynthetic bacteria or plants.  Organisms that can use carbon dioxide and water as their sole source of energy are classified as autotrophs. These organisms may be single-celled or multicellular, but all require light to produce organic molecules from simple inorganic compounds. The most common autotrophs are plants, which can be found on every continent except Antarctica.

Lancs/Cheshire Division Two (usually referred to as the North West Counties League) is a football league in England which was formed in 1974 as a merger of the Lancashire County League and Cheshire County League.  The league is made up of clubs from the north west of England, with clubs from Cheshire and Merseyside also being represented. The league has been known as the North West Counties League since its formation, but changed its name to the Lancs/Cheshire Division Two League in 2002.  The league is at tier 7 of the English football league system. The champions are promoted to the Northern Premier League Division One while the runners-up are promoted to the Central Midlands League. The third placed team is relegated to the Lancashire County League while the fourth placed team enters a play-off with the third placed team from the Northern Premier League Division One for one spot in that division.  The league has played its games at a number of grounds over its history, with the current home of the clubs being at Frickley Athletic's Moss Rose stadium.

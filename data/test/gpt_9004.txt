Journeyman is the eleventh solo studio album by English musician and songwriter Neal Morse. It was released on 15 October 2017 through InsideOut Music.  The album was produced by Morse and longtime collaborator, drummer and producer Terry Brown, who has worked with him since the early days of the progressive rock band Spock's Beard. Morse also recruited guitarist Lauri Porrazzo (of the progressive metal band Dream Theater) and keyboardist David Young to round out the album's touring band.  "Journeyman" is a concept album recounting the story of a journeyman artisan, or craftsman, who labors in an unfulfilling job until he is fired and then finds new purpose in his life. The lyrics explore themes of hope, redemption, and growth. Morse has said that "Journeyman" is his most personal album to date, and that it is inspired by his own life experiences.  Upon release, "Journeyman" received positive reviews from music critics. Many praised its experimental sound and the lyrical depth of its songs. It debuted at number one on the American Billboard 200 chart, becoming Morse's tenth solo album to do so. The album has sold over 107,000 copies in the United States as of September 2018.

Kindred: The Embraced is an American television series produced by John Leekley Productions and Spelling Television. Loosely based on the role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade, the series premiered on Fox on April 2, 1996, and ran for seven episodes before it was canceled with one episode unaired on May 9, 1996. Synopsis The series initially focused on San Francisco Police Detective Frank Kohanek (C. Thomas Howell) who discovers his city is home to numerous vampires while investigating alleged mobster Julian Luna (Mark Frankel). Julian is not really a mobster, as Frank thinks; in fact, he is the Prince of the city, the ruler of five groups of vampires in the city, collectively called "the Kindred". Frank had been romantically involved with Julian's former lover; Alexandra. Before Alexandra dies as punishment for breaking the "Masquerade" she asks Julian to protect Frank as a special favor to her; which he does. The two form an odd sort of friendship as the series progresses. Julian provides Frank with insights and information regarding the vampire community as related to crimes he is investigating. While Frank is able to act discreetly on Julian's behalf if needed. Further, Frank is shown to be somewhat resistant to a vampire's powers due to his past physical intimacy with a vampire.

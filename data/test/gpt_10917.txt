Jonathan Glatzer (born 21 October 1969) is an American computer scientist, specializing in artificial intelligence and natural language processing.  Glatzer received his B.S. in mathematics from Yale University in 1991 and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1993 and 1996, respectively. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the MIT Media Laboratory from 1996 to 1997, and then a faculty member at the University of Southern California from 1997 to 2000. In 2000, he became a professor at Stanford University, where he is currently the Alexander von Humboldt Professor of Computer Science and Director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL).  Glatzer is a co-founder of Google Brain, which was acquired by Google in 2014. He also founded Recursive Inc., a machine learning startup acquired by Cloudera in 2016.  Glatzer's research focuses on artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), robotics, and statistical learning theory. He is known for his work on deep learning, a field of AI that uses neural networks to learn complex tasks without being explicitly programmed. His work has been influential in the development of AI software such as Google's AlphaGo and Facebook'schatbot M

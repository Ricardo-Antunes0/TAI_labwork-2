Ankyrin-B, also known as Ankyrin-2, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ANK2 gene. Ankyrin-B is a member of the ankyrin family of proteins, which are characterized by their ability to form ankyrin-like complexes. The ankyrin family of proteins plays important roles in cellular processes such as protein folding and trafficking.  Ankyrin-B has been shown to interact with the following proteins:

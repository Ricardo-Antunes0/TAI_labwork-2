A psycholinguist is a social scientist who specializes in the study of language. Psycholinguists investigate the psychological processes that underlie language use, including cognition, language acquisition, andliction, and dyslexia. They also study the cognitive consequences of language disorders, such as aphasia. Psycholinguists work in a variety of disciplines, including linguistics, psychology, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience.

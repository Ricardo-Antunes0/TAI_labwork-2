Thepublicrecord.com (TPR) is the brainchild of producer and journalist Tom Owen. It is an online database of government records and documents, including financial data, court filings, and land deeds.   TPR was officially launched in February of 2007 and has grown steadily since then. The site now includes more than 1 million records from more than 2,000 government entities. TPR is a free resource, and its content is made available in both a text-based format and as a downloadable database.  TPR's mission is to make public information more accessible and useful by providing a one-stop shop for researchers, journalists, and the public at large. By making government records available online, TPR helps to ensure that the public has access to the information it needs to hold government accountable.

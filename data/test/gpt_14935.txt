'W' Hour  was the codename for the first covert operation of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the Cold War. The operation was conducted between February and April 1953, and was tasked with overthrowing the democratically elected leader of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.  The operation was a complete failure, and resulted in the death of several CIA agents and Iranian civilians. The operation is considered one of the biggest failures in CIA history.

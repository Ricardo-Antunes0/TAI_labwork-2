Metagaming is a term used in role-playing games (RPGs) to describe any actions taken by the player that are not directly related to the game's mechanics. These actions can take many forms, from strategic planning to socializing with other players.  Metagaming is a controversial topic, with some players believing that it is a necessary part of the RPG experience, while others see it as cheating. Regardless of opinions, metagaming is often used by players to help them succeed in the game by taking advantage of their knowledge of the world and the characters within it.

The Green Corn Rebellion was an armed conflict in the United States that took place from 1892 to 1894. It was a response to the break-up of the Great Plains region and the consequent loss of cheap labor.  Led by Pancho Villa, the rebellion was fought mainly in New Mexico and Texas. The United States Army, led by General John J. Pershing, defeated Villa and his forces, and restored order. The rebellion has been seen as an important event in American history, and its memory is commemorated annually in the United States on October 12.

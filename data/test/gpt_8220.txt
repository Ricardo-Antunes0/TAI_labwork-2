Cleverbot is a chatterbot web application that allows users to converse with a computer program. It was created in 2004 by Canadian software developer David Levy and is owned by Google.  Cleverbot was designed as a way for people to practice conversing with computers, and has since been used by researchers and developers to study artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. It has also been used as a tool for teaching AI to navigate human conversation.

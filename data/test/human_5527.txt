Alsap Butte is a 7,494-foot-elevation (2,284 meter) summit located in the Grand Canyon in Coconino County of northern Arizona, USA. It is situated two miles north of the Roosevelt Point on the canyon's North Rim, where it towers 3,700 feet (1,130 meters) above Nankoweap Canyon. Its nearest higher neighbor is Brady Peak, one mile to the southwest,  with Hancock Butte and Mount Hayden set to the northwest, and Colter Butte two miles to southeast. Alsap Butte is named after John T. Alsap, a pioneer and politician of the Arizona Territory who served as the first mayor of Phoenix, and is known as "Father of Maricopa County". The geographical feature's name was officially adopted in 1932 by the United States Board on Geographic Names. According to the KÃ¶ppen climate classification system, Alsap Butte is located in a cold semi-arid climate zone. Alsap Butte is composed of Pennsylvanian-Permian Supai Group overlaying cliff-forming Mississippian Redwall Limestone, which in turn overlays slope-forming Cambrian Tonto Group. Precipitation runoff from this feature drains northeast into the Colorado River via Nankoweap Creek. See also  Geology of the Grand Canyon area

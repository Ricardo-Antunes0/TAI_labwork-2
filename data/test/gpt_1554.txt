The Piedras Encimadas Valley (Stacked Stones in English) is a geological formation in the province of Burgos, Castile and León, central Spain. It is located about 35 kilometers southeast of Burgos, in the municipalities of San Vicente de la Alcázar and Almazán de Henares. The valley is formed by the accumulation of angular blocks of pink sandstone and shale, up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) high, that were deposited during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.

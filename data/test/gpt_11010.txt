These include falls, collisions with other horses, and accidents caused by jockeys. There is also a risk of getting injured if the horse falls or becomes entangled in its harness. Injuries can also be caused by weather conditions, such as rain or snow.   There are a number of ways to prevent racehorse injuries and fatalities. This includes taking care when training and racing horses, and making sure that they are properly equipped. It is also important to have a system in place for tracking injuries and fatalities, so that appropriate action can be taken.

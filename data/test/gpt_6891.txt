Great American Bank was an American savings and loan association that operated from 1917 to 1984.  Great American Bank was originally chartered in 1917 as the Mason City National Bank. The bank expanded rapidly during its early years, and by 1929 had assets of $100 million. The bank went through a series of ownership changes over the years, eventually being acquired by United Savings and Loan Association in 1984. United Savings and Loan Association went bankrupt in 1989, leading to Great American Bank's collapse four years later. The bank's assets were ultimately seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

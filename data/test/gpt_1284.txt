Peterlee is a town in County Durham, England. It is situated on the River Tyne, 15 miles north-west of Durham and 10 miles south of North Shields.  The town has a population of about 34,000, making it the fifth largest settlement in County Durham. It is part of the metropolitan borough of Sunderland and the Newcastle metropolitan area.  The town's name derives from Saint Peter and Lea, a nun who founded a convent here in 682 AD. The town became an industrial centre in the 19th century, with cotton mills and tobacco factories being some of its most notable industries. However, these have all since closed down.  The town is now mainly a residential suburb of Sunderland, with some light industry remaining. The main attractions are the Peterlee Museum and Art Gallery, which houses a large collection of local art and historical items, as well as the Riverside Stadium, which is home to Sunderland A.F.C.

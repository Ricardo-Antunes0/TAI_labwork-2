The codex (plural codices ) was the preferred format for books in the ancient world, used by both Jews and Christians. The name is derived from the Latin word codex, meaning a book of leaves.  The codex was a popular format for writing and reading books in the ancient world. It consisted of sheets of papyrus or parchment folded together into sections or sometimes left as one large sheet. The pages were often divided into small squares, which were then sewn together. This made it easy to remove individual pages so that they could be read or copied.  The codex was used by both Jews and Christians. Jews used it because they did not have papermaking skills and Christians used it because they wanted to avoid any religious references that might be offensive to their opponents. The codex was also popular because it was easy to transport.

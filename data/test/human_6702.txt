The Save Romania Union (, USR) is a liberal and progressive political party in Romania, currently the third largest party both in the Parliament and locally at nationwide level. The party was founded following the success of the Save Bucharest Union (USB) party in the 2016 local elections. After being officially registered as a political party in 2016, it united with the local USB and Union for Codlea parties, thus gaining most of its initial membership base from the two latter parties. Between 2016 and 2020, it was the third largest political party in the Romanian Parliament after the 2016 legislative elections and ran on an anti-corruption platform. In 2019, it established a political alliance with the Freedom, Unity and Solidarity Party (PLUS) led by former technocratic Prime Minister Dacian Ciolo»ô which it eventually absorbed in 2021. Starting from December 2020 onwards, USR is still the third largest political party in the Romanian Parliament after the 2020 Romanian legislative elections, running once more on an even more successful anti-corruption platform compared to the previous legislative elections from 2016.

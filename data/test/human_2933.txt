The Wesel Convention was a secret gathering of leading church people from Dutch refugee communities, believed to have taken place in November 1568 in the Hanseatic city of Wesel. While there have been questions about the date and place of this Convention, decisions taken around that time are still influential for the church order of Reformed churches in the Netherlands. These decisions also led to the introduction of the presbyterial-synodal structures of affiliated churches, first in the duchies of Jülich-Kleve-Berg, and later in all German provincial churches. Recent research, however, has disputed whether this specific gathering occurred at all, or if it took place in a different year and location. Background Both Martin Luther and John Calvin were active during the Reformation in the Dutch provinces, a populous and economically important territory. Starting in 1567, the Duke of Alba, governor of the Netherlands on behalf of Habsburg emperor, King Philip II of Spain, brutally suppressed Calvinism and the initial Dutch Revolt. This action triggered the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648), which eventually resulted in the independence of the United Netherlands.

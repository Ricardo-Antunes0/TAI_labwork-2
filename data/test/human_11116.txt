"Missile Gap" is a 2006 English language science fiction novella, originally published in the anthology One Million A.D. by British author Charles Stross. It won the Locus Award for best novella of 2006. The novella was republished in Stross's short-story collection Wireless in 2009. Plot  On 2 October 1962, the universe underwent a change â€“ instantly, the continents of the Earth were no longer wrapped onto a spherical planet but were on the surface of an Alderson disk. Measurements on Cepheid variable stars indicate that the Alderson disk is located in the Lesser Magellanic Cloud, and that the epoch is roughly 800,000 years later than the calendar date (give or take 100,000 to 200,000 years). In the sky, the stars of the Milky Way are reddened and metal-depleted, evidence that it is now controlled by a Type-III civilisation capable of controlling the resources of an entire galaxy. Three theories for the change are suggested within the novella:  the atoms making up the surface and people of earth have somehow peeled off the Earth and shipped to a new location.  Marvin Minsky suggests that a snapshot of the world was taken and the snapshot has been used as the basis for a physical recreation.  Hans Moravec suggests that a snapshot of the world was taken and the snapshot has been used as the basis for a simulated reality.

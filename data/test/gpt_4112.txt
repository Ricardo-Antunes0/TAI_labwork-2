Cystidicoloides tenuissima is a species of nematodes in the family Cystidicolidae. It is found in Central America and North America.  The nematodes are small, measuring 8-10 mm in length, and they have a distinctive light-colored body with a dark stripe running the length of it. They have a pair of light-colored eyes and a pair of dark antennae. The males have a longer tail than the females.  The cystidicolid nematodes are parasites of marine invertebrates, particularly molluscs, crustaceans, and polychaetes. They attach themselves to the host organism by secreting a cementlike material from their digestive system. This material hardens and forms a cyst around the host body, from which the nematodes can feed and reproduce.

is a Japanese 2000 romance film directed by Hirokazu Koreeda. It tells the story of Yūsuke Watanabe, a successful advertising executive, and the woman he meets on a train, Kōichi Nomura.  After Yūsuke and Kōichi's initial meeting on a train, they begin a sporadic correspondence, in which Kōichi reveals herself to be a writer who has been living in Japan for many years without marriage or children. Yūsuke is initially reticent to get too close to Kōichi, believing that she is just another lonely woman looking for friendship. However, as their correspondence deepens, Yūsuke begins to fall in love with Kōichi and decides to fly to Japan to meet her. Once they finally meet face-to-face, the two spend the night together and declare their love for each other.  Despite their happiness, they are forced to end their relationship when Kōichi's visa expires and she must return to her home country. Yūsuke remains in Japan, continuing to write to Kōichi. They eventually marry and have a son together.   The film was well-received by both critics and audiences alike and has been cited as one of Koreeda's best works. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 68th Academy Awards but lost to "The Lives of Others".   "Sleeping Bride" tells the story of Yūsuke

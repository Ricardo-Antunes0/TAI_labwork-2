Pope John I (; died 18 May 732) was the Bishop of Rome from 725 to his death.  Pope John I was a son of Pope Leo III and a nephew of Emperor Constantine VI. He succeeded his uncle as pope in 725, and reigned for fourteen years. He was the last pope to be consecrated by the Byzantine Emperor.  Pope John I is chiefly remembered for his efforts to secure papal primacy over the other bishops of the world, and for his conflict with the Frankish King Pepin the Short. He also re-established Roman authority in former Byzantine provinces in southern Italy.  Pope John I died in 732, aged seventy-eight years, and was buried in St. Peter's Basilica.

After teaching at Yale and Princeton, he became a professor at the University of Missouri in 1934. Pilichowski is best known for his work on cryptography and number theory, which included the development of the theory of modular arithmetic. He also made important contributions to probability theory and mathematical analysis. Pilichowski died in Missouri at the age of 76.

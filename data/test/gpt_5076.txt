Isotachophoresis (ITP) is a technique in analytical chemistry that uses an electric field to move molecules or ions through solution. The electric field causes the molecules or ions to move towards the anode (positive terminal), while the counter-electromotive force (emitting electrode) keeps them away from the cathode (negative terminal). ITP is used to improve the resolution of mass spectrometric analysis, increase the speed of reactions, and improve the accuracy of measurements.

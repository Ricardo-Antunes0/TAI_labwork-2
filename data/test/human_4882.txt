Hijack is a 1973 American made-for-television action drama thriller film directed by Leonard Horn and starring David Janssen, Keenan Wynn and Lee Purcell. Plot Two desperate truck drivers, Jake and Donny, accept an assignment by a man named Kleiner to transport a "super important" cargo for $6,000. The men don't know what's in the cargo, but they find out that another group of men is willing to kill for the haul.  Throughout the trip, Jake and Donny are repeatedly attacked by the mercenaries, but the pair always manages to get past them, while also gradually eliminating the crooks one by one.  When they finally reach their destination, the enraged Jake breaks the lock on the trailer door and they find out that the trailer is loaded with nothing but burlap sacks filled with sand.  Kleiner reveals that the truck had merely been a decoy to cause the mercs to direct their attention to the wrong vehicle; the actual secret cargo had been quietly shipped the night before.

Parker is an English language unisex given name. It is derived from the Old English name "Perca", meaning "son of Perc".   The name Parker has been in use since the Middle Ages, but it achieved its greatest popularity in the early 20th century. It was most commonly given to boys in the United States between 1910 and 1930, but has since become much more popular across all genders.

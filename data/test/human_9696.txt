The Lads Society is a far-right white nationalist extremist group founded by several former members of the United Patriots Front (UPF) in late 2017, with club houses in Sydney and Melbourne. The Lads Society came to national prominence after it staged a rally in St Kilda, Victoria, targeting the local African Australian community. Attendees were seen making the Nazi salute and one was photographed brandishing an SS helmet.  In 2017, the group's leader, New Zealand-born Thomas Sewell asked Brenton Harrison Tarrant (the perpetrator of the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings) to join the Lads Society, but Tarrant refused. The group's members and allies attempted to infiltrate the Young Nationals in New South Wales, and engaged in branch stacking at the May 2018 conference. Lads Society members attained leadership positions in the Young Nationals, but were later forced out of the party. The Melbourne Chapter has since become the National Socialist Network

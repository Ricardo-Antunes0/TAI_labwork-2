Davorin "Davo" Karničar (October 26, 1962 – September 16, 2019) was a Slovene alpinist and extreme skier. As an active mountain skier, Davo was a member of the Yugoslavian national mountain ski team between 1975 and 1982. An alpinist since 1980, he climbed in 1989 to Nanga Parbat in Pakistan and in 1993 to K2, which borders Pakistan and The People's Republic of China. In 1995 he made his first ski descent from Annapurna in Nepal and in 1996 he made a ski descent from Shishapangma in Tibet. By 2010 he had accomplished over 1,500 mountain climbs and ski descents. He was the first person to make a complete ski descent from the Seven Summits, less than one month after the first person, Kit DesLauriers (a woman), skied from the top of all of the seven summits, but did not accomplish complete descents on Everest and Denali. Davo was only 38 years old when he became the first person to ski down from the summit of the highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest, on October 7, 2000.

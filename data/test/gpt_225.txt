The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is an agency within the United States Department of Homeland Security responsible for aviation security. The TSA was created after the September 11th terrorist attacks in 2001 and has since expanded its responsibilities to cover all modes of transportation. The TSA currently employs over 45,000 people.  The TSA is responsible for screening passengers and baggage at airports across the United States. In addition to traditional security measures, the TSA also employs canine teams and explosive detection units to help detect potential threats. The TSA has been criticized for its extensive pat-down procedures and its reported lack of transparency.

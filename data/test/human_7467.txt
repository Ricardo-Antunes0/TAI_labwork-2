The M16 was a  spin-stabilized unguided rocket developed by the United States Army during the Second World War. Entering service in April 1945 to replace the earlier fin-stabilised 4.5-inch M8 rocket, it was used late in the war and also during the Korean War before being removed from service. Development Developed during the latter stages of the Second World War, the M16 was the first spin-stabilized   rocket to be standardized for production by the United States Army.  in length, it could hit targets as far as  from its launcher. The M16 was launched from T66 "Honeycomb" 3x8 24-tube launchers, M21 5x5 25-tube launchers, and could also be fired from 60-tube "Hornet's Nest" launchers. The United States Marine Corps developed launching systems for the M16 rocket as well, capable of being fitted to standard 3/4 and 2.5-ton trucks. A version of the M16 rocket for single launchers, the M20, was developed as a derivative; practice rounds designated M17 and M21 were also manufactured.

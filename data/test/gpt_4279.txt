In chess played with a time control, each player has a limited number of moves per game. A player who runs out of time is said to be in time trouble.  Chess is a game that can take a long time to play. If you're playing against someone who is good at the game, they may be able to take advantage of your slow reaction times by making quick moves that you can't counter. If you're in time trouble, it can be hard to get out of it.

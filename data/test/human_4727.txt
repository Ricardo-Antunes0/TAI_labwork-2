Phil Tollestrup (born October 21, 1949) is a former Olympic basketball player as a member of the Canadian national men's basketball team during the 1970s. Six feet, six inches tall forward, Tollestrup attributes the development of his basketball ability to his being able to practice on a daily basis both at his school gym, where his father was janitor, and at the local cultural centre, which has an open gym.  The native of Raymond, Alberta was later a member of his local basketball team which won the provincial youth basketball championship in 1967 and '68.  He played college basketball at Brigham Young University, and was a teammate of Cougar and Yugoslav legend Kresimir Cosić.  He then played an additional year of college ball with the University of Lethbridge Pronghorns where for 1972-3 he was named Male Pronghorn Athlete of the Year and a CIAU All-Canadian.  After college, he was drafted by the Buffalo Braves with their last pick in the 1973 draft (19th round, 211th overall), but never played in the NBA. Instead, he played professionally with a club in the Spanish first division for the 1973-4 season, Saski Baskonia - TAU Cerámica.

Bessarabian (foaled 1982 in Pennsylvania) is a Canadian Champion Thoroughbred racehorse. Owned by Thor Eaton's Eaton Hall Farm, the Eaton family member entrusted her race conditioning to Mike Doyle. The millionaire granddaughter of Northern Dancer, Bessarabian raced in Canada and the United States. Racing career As a two-year-old, Bessarabian had an outstanding season with wins in the Ontario Debutante and Mazarine Stakes. Sent to compete in the United States, on October 26 she scored an impressive victory at Garden State Park, winning the $200,000 G2 Gardenia Stakes by more than nine lengths. That performance would see Bessarabian sent off as the parimutuel betting favorite in the 1984 inaugural running of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies held that year at California's Hollywood Park Racetrack. However, coming out of the first turn of the race, Fran's Valentine veered wide and knocked another horse off stride and into Bessarabian who never recovered and finished fifth. Fran's Valentine won the race but was disqualified and the win awarded to runner-up, Outstandingly.

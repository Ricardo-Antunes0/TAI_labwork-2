John Fante (April 8, 1909 – May 14, 1993) was an American author and journalist. He is best known for his novels, notably Ask the Dust (1939), The Grapes of Wrath (1939), and Blood Meridian (1929).  Fante was born in Newark, New Jersey, the son of Italian immigrants. After a brief stint as a reporter for the Newark Star-Ledger, Fante began writing for magazines and newspapers, including the Saturday Evening Post and the New York Herald Tribune. He also worked as a screenwriter and producer.  Fante's first novel, Ask the Dust, was published in 1939. It tells the story of two brothers—the good one, Casy, and the bad one, Chico—and their struggles in the 1930s drought-ridden California farm country. The Grapes of Wrath followed in 1939 and tells the story of the Joad family's journey from Oklahoma to California during the Great Depression. Blood Meridian is Fante's only novel set in the American West. It tells the story of a group of scalp hunters on a mission to capture a Mexican bandit named John Grady Cole.

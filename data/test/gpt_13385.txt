Elizabeth Maud Hoffman, née Morgan, also known as Lizzie, was an English writer and translator. She is best known for her translations of the Czechoslovak poet Karel Čapek, as well as her own works.  Elizabeth Maud Hoffman was born on 10 March 1876 in London to a distinguished family of doctors and lawyers. She was educated at home by her mother and then took up studies at the University of Cambridge, where she met and married the philosopher Bertrand Russell in 1900. The couple soon moved to Prague, where Russell became a professor at the University of Prague.  Hoffman began writing in her early twenties, publishing her first book of poetry in 1902. In 1905 she and Russell parted ways, with Hoffman moving back to London to resume her writing career. She continued to publish poetry and prose throughout the 1910s and 1920s, establishing herself as one of the leading exponents of modernist poetry in English.  In 1938 Hoffman moved to the United States, where she worked as a translator for the Foreign Service Institute. She died on 14 November 1979 in Washington, D.C.

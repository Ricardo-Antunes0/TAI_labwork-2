The All-America Football Conference (AAFC) was a professional American football league that operated for two seasons during the early 1960s. The AAFC was created as a response to the National Football League's (NFL) monopoly. The AAFC was founded by Lamar Hunt, who also created the NFL.  The AAFC was composed of eight teams, six from the West and two from the East. The only teams from the NFL that participated in the AAFC were the Cleveland Browns and the San Francisco 49ers. The AAFC's champion was the Buffalo Bills, who defeated the Baltimore Colts in the playoffs.  The AAFC's main attraction was its parity; every team had a chance to win each week. This parity led to great games and some of the most exciting professional football ever seen. The AAFC also had some of the best players in the league, including Joe Namath, Jim Brown, and Johnny Unitas. However, despite its many successes, the AAFC was ultimately unsuccessful due to financial problems.

John Corbett (March 23, 1926 â€“ September 15, 2013) was an American chemist and Nobel Prize laureate.  Corbett was born in New York City, and received his B.A. from Yale University in 1948 and his Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1952. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, before joining the faculty of the University of California, Davis, where he served as both the chair of the chemistry department and the director of the university research laboratory. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974 and a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1977.  In 1981, Corbett was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on linking chemical reactivity with electronic structure. Corbett's work has led to new insights into enzyme catalysis and other chemical reactions, as well as to developments in computer-aided design.

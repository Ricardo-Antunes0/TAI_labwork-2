Paschase Broët (1500?- 14 September 1562) was a Flemish painter and draughtsman, who was the leading artist of his generation in the Low Countries.  Paschase Broët was born in or around 1500, probably in the town of Tournai in present-day Belgium. He was the son of a weaver named Jan Broët and likely received his early training in the local art tradition. Around 1524 he moved to Brussels, where he became one of the most popular painters of his era. He married Margriet, who died in 1544, and with her had three children.  Broët is best known for his religious works, which typically depict scenes from the Bible or from Catholic myths and legends. He produced a significant number of altarpieces and triptychs, as well as single paintings. His work is noted for its realism and skillful use of lighting and shadow. Broët was also an outstanding draughtsman, and his drawings often serve as a basis for his paintings.  Broët died in Brussels on 14 September 1562. He is buried in the Church of Our Lady at the Grote Markt.

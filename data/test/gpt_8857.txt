Mittineague Park is an approximately  urban park located in the city of Detroit, Michigan. The park is bounded by Woodward Avenue on the north, Fort Street on the east, 3rd Street on the south, and Clairmount Avenue on the west.   Mittineague Park was originally acquired by the City of Detroit in 1884 as a public garden and recreation area. The park's name is derived from Mittineague Farm, which was located adjacent to the park on its eastern boundary. The farmhouse still stands and is used as an administrative building for the park.   The park has undergone many changes over the years but has retained its original layout and features. The centerpiece of the park is a large lawn that is used for various events including concerts and weddings. There are also several small gardens that contain plants that are native to Michigan. The park also includes a playground, a basketball court, and a baseball diamond.   Mittineague Park is open daily from sunrise to sunset.

Gary Douglas Beer (born 10 October 1941), was a New Zealand cricketer who played 19 first-class matches for the Central Districts and Otago in the 1960s. Beer was born at Christchurch in New Zealand and played club cricket for Sydenham Cricket Club in the city. He was described in 1961, before his first-class debut, as "one of the most promising cricketers in Canterbury" and as an "aggressive opening bat, a fine fielder with a good arm, and a useful, medium-pace bowler". He played under-20 and under-23 cricket for Canterbury in 1961/62 and under-23 cricket for Central Districts the following season, during which he made his first-class debut in March 1963, playing for a New Zealand under-23 side against Northern Districts. He went on to make his Plunket Shield debut for Central Districts in December of the same year. He played six matches for Central Districts over the following two seasons, his final first-class appearance for the side coming against the touring Pakistanis in February 1965.

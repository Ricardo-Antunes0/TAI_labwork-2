The Rylands Building is a Grade II* listed building on Ormeau Road in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It was designed by the Glasgow-based architect John Burnet Tait and constructed in 1899-1900. The building is made up of a central block with two flanking wings, both of which are in the Renaissance Revival style. It is one of the few surviving examples of Tait's work in Belfast.   The Rylands Building was originally commissioned by Samuel Rylands, a Scottish millionaire who had made his fortune in the tobacco and shipping industries. Rylands desired a prestigious home for himself and his family, and Tait was chosen to design it based on his previous work in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Construction began in 1899 and finished two years later; at the time, it was one of the most expensive homes in Belfast. The Rylands family occupied the building until 1965, when it was sold to the University of Ulster. It has since been used as a venue for weddings, conferences, and other events.  The Rylands Building is made up of a central block with two flanking wings. The central block is three stories high and has a domed roof; the wings are two stories high and have flat roofs. The building is decorated with marble carvings, including a statue of Neptune by Alfred Gilbert overlooking the front entrance. The exterior of the building is painted cream while the interior is painted black.

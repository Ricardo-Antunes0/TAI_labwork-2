Sepik virus (SEPV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) of the genus Flavivirus and family Flaviviridae. Flaviviridae is one of the most well characterized viral families, as it contains many well-known viruses that cause diseases that have become very prevalent in the world, like Dengue virus. The genus Flavivirus is one of the largest viral genera and encompasses over 50 viral species, including tick and mosquito borne viruses like Yellow fever virus and West Nile virus. Sepik virus is much less well known and has not been as well-classified as other viruses because it has not been known of for very long. Sepik virus was first isolated in 1966 from the mosquito Mansonia septempunctata, and it derives its name from the Sepik River area in Papua New Guinea, where it was first found. The geographic range of Sepik virus is limited to Papua New Guinea, due to its isolation. Arboviruses are a continuing threat to public health in Papua New Guinea especially because of lack of surveillance and reporting, so much of the prevalence of disease due to these viruses are unknown in that area. Arboviruses cause outbreaks when the virus that infects an endemic population spreads through a vector like mosquitoes or ticks to humans. While the principal host species for Sepik virus is still unknown, it has been discovered that the primary mosquito species that transmits Sepik virus is Mansonia septempunctata. This differs from other related viruses, as most of the well-classified mosquito borne viruses public health officials focus on are transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti.

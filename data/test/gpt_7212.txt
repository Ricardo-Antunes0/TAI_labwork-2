In taxation and accounting, transfer pricing refers to the determination of the price that one company charges another for goods or services. This price may be fixed or negotiated, and is based on the relative value of the goods or services involved.  Transfer pricing is often used in business to minimize tax liability. Tax authorities may seek to recover tax that has been overpaid, or to target tax avoidance schemes. In some cases, transfer pricing can be used to generate illegal profits.  The main transfer pricing analysis techniques are: -Costs of production (COP) analysis: This approach uses actual costs incurred by producing a good or service in order to arrive at a transfer price.  -Input-output analysis: This approach uses information on the quantities of inputs and outputs used in producing a good or service to arrive at a transfer price.  -Benchmarking: This approach compares the price of a good or service with prices of similar goods or services and uses this information to arrive at a transfer price.

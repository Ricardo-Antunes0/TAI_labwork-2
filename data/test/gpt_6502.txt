Violent by Design is the second album by Canadian nu metal band Korn. It was released on April 20, 2003, through Roadrunner Records.  The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart with first-week sales of over 170,000 copies. It has since been certified platinum by the RIAA. The album spawned three singles: "Got the Life", "Psycho" and "Freak on a Leash".  The album's sound is darker and more aggressive than their previous release, Untouchables. The band cited influences such as Pantera, Slipknot and Slayer, as well as their own personal experiences with violence and addiction.  Korn toured in support of the album in 2003 and 2004. In 2006, they recorded a cover of the Alice in Chains song "Man in the Box" for the soundtrack to the film Blade: Trinity.

Solar Ash is a science fiction adventure novel by American writer David Brin. It was published in hardcover by Tor Books on October 3, 2009, and in paperback on March 4, 2010.  The novel tells the story of humanity's first encounter with a advanced alien civilization, and the battle to save Earth from their own destruction.  "Solar Ash" is set seventy-five years after a cataclysm has destroyed most of civilization, leaving the United States and most of the world uninhabitable. A small band of survivors has retreated to a fortified compound on the Pacific Island of Oahu.  When a reconnaissance mission finds evidence that an alien civilization is living on the other side of the sun, the survivors must decide whether to risk all for a chance at salvation, or stay safe behind their walls. As the aliens come closer, they discover that the humans have developed powerful technologies of their own. The battle for Oahu turns into a race against time as both sides struggle to understand and master each other's ways.

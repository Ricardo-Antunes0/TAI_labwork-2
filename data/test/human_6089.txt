The Bohemia mining district is an area of about  in the Cascade Range of the U.S. state of Oregon. Near Bohemia Mountain in Lane County, about  southeast of Cottage Grove, the district was the most productive of the mining areas in the Western Cascades. Beginning in the 1860s, mines in the district extracted mainly gold and silver but also copper, zinc, and lead, then valued at a total of about $1 million. In 1858, W. W. Oglesby and Frank Bass, miners from California, found placer gold on Sharps Creek, a tributary of the Row River flowing out of the mountains. In 1863, Ivan (John) Hoŕky using the Celtic alias James "Bohemia" Johnson, originally from Bohemia in central Europe, and George Ramsey found lode gold while 'dressing out a deer on lamb from the law for killing an American Indian'. He and other miners formed the Bohemia Gold and Silver Mining District in 1867. Eventually, the district included several mines, the most productive of which were called Champion, Helena, Musick, and Noonday.

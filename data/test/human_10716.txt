The Vikhroli-Kopar Khairne Link Road (VKLR), also known as the JVLR-Kopar Khairane-Ghansoli Bridge, is a proposed 7.5 km to 10 km, freeway grade road bridge connecting the Indian city of Mumbai with Navi Mumbai, its satellite city. The new link road would start at Eastern Express Highway (EEH) where Jogeshwari–Vikhroli Link Road (JVLR) ends in Vikhroli, then cross Thane Creek and Harbour railway line and will terminate at Kopar Khairane in Navi Mumbai before ending on Thane- Belapur road. The link would be a six-lane road of about 10 km in length including a  bridge over the Thane creek. At present motorists have to take either the Vashi Bridge or Mulund-Airoli Link Road to go to Navi Mumbai and Pune. The new road will help motorists save time and fuel. The project is estimated to cost around ₹ 550 to 1200 crore. Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) appointed N P Bridging (Belgium company), as designing consultants for the project, which was supposed to submit the final report on the link road by mid-September 2016. Significance It will be the fourth bridge over the Thane creek; the other three being the Vashi Bridge connecting Mankhurd to Vashi, the Airoli Bridge connecting Mulund to Airoli and the Kalwa bridge connecting Thane and Kalwa. The Navi Mumbai-end provides for a seamless corridor for travelling to Thane, Dombivli, Kalyan, Panvel (which is itself now a node of Navi Mumbai) & Ambernath and beyond besides throwing open a direct corridor with the new Navi Mumbai International Airport in Ulwe node of Navi Mumbai. It will mean easier access for residents of Ghatkopar, Powai, Vikhroli, and Bhandup. The connector will lead to a real estate boom as travel time will reduce by about an hour.

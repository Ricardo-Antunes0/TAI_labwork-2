Keswick is a residential neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is bounded by Loch Raven Boulevard to the north, Cold Spring Lane to the east, Hampshire Street to the south, and Central Avenue to the west. The population was 8,827 at the 2010 census.  Keswick was founded in 1892 by Samuel S. Keswick and his wife, Flora. They named their settlement after the town of Keswick in Cumbria, England. The first businesses in Keswick were a grocery store and a clothing store. The population grew slowly at first, but by the 1920s it had reached its peak of 10,000 residents. However, the Great Depression and the resulting World War II caused a decline in the population and by 1950 it had decreased to 6,000. In recent years, however, the population has begun to grow again; as of 2010 it had reached 8,827 residents.  The main businesses in Keswick today are residential neighborhoods and retail stores. There are several schools in Keswick: Walter Johnson High School (formerly known as Baltimore Polytechnic Institute), Calvert Hall School for Boys (formerly known as Calvert Hall College), and Notre Dame de Namur School for Girls (formerly known as Notre Dame of Maryland). There is also a branch of the Baltimore City Public Library located in Keswick.

Mount Newcomb is a 13,422-foot-elevation (4,091 meter) mountain summit located just west of the crest of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in Tulare County, California. It is situated in Sequoia National Park, and is 2.8 miles (4.5 km) south of Mount Whitney, 1.1 mile (1.8 km) northeast of Mount Chamberlin, and 3.5 miles west of Mount Corcoran. Mt. Newcomb ranks as the 70th highest summit in California. Topographic relief is significant as it rises 2,083 feet (635 meters) above the second Crabtree Lake in approximately one mile. This mountain's name was officially adopted in 1940 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names to honor American astronomer Simon Newcomb (1835–1909). The first ascent of the summit was made August 22, 1936, by Max Eckenburg and Bob Rumohr.

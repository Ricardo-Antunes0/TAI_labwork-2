The Colorado Organic Act was enacted in 2002, and is a state law regulating organic farming and production. The Act defines organic farming as methods of production that use natural processes and materials, and prohibits the use of synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. The Act also establishes a program to certify organic farmers and producers, and establishes penalties for violations.

The rhizosphere is the narrow region of soil surrounding a rhizome, a long, horizontal root system. The rhizosphere is the site where plant roots attach to the soil and exchange water, nutrients, and gases with the environment. The rhizosphere is also home to a variety of microorganisms that contribute to plant growth and health.

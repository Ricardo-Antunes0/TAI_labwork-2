Lethal white syndrome (LWS), also called overo lethal white syndrome (OLWS), lethal white overo (LWO), and overo lethal white foal syndrome (OLWFS), is an autosomal genetic disorder most prevalent in the American Paint Horse. Affected foals are born after the full 11-month gestation and externally appear normal, though they have all-white or nearly all-white coats and blue eyes. However, internally, these foals have a nonfunctioning colon.  Within a few hours, signs of colic appear; affected foals die within a few days.  Because the death is often painful, such foals are often humanely euthanized once identified.  The disease is particularly devastating because foals are born seemingly healthy after being carried to full term.<ref name=apha>{{cite web  |url         = http://ads.apha.com/Sitefinity_Website_Images/breed/lethalwhites03.html  |title       = Stalking the Lethal White Syndrome: University of Minnesota researchers track down the gene responsible for lethal white foals, from the July 1998 Paint Horse Journal..  |author1     = Paul D.

A mutation in the middle of the endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB) gene causes lethal white syndrome when homozygous. Carriers, which are heterozygous—that is, have one copy of the mutated allele, but themselves are healthy—can now be reliably identified with a DNA test.  Both parents must be carriers of one copy of the LWS allele for an affected foal to be born.

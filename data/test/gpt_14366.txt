The Dawson Arkose is a geologic formation in the province of Alberta, Canada. It is a coal-bearing stratum, laid down during the late Cretaceous period. The formation is about 85 kilometres long and up to 25 kilometres wide.  The Dawson Arkose is named after the Dawson Coal Company, which mined it extensively in the early 20th century. The coal was used to fire industrial plants in Edmonton and Calgary.

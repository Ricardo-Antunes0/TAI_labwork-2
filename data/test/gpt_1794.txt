The Big-4 League was a top level professional ice hockey league in North America, which operated from 1946 to 1979. The league consisted of the Montreal Canadiens, Boston Bruins, Detroit Red Wings, and Chicago Blackhawks.  The Big-4 League was founded in 1946 as a response to the Major League Hockey (now the National Hockey League) expanding into new markets. The league quickly established itself as a top level league, with all four teams winning the Stanley Cup at least once. The league disbanded in 1979 due to financial issues, but was revived in 1992 as the International Hockey League.

Yahoo HotJobs, formerly known as hotjobs.com, was a job search engine and career blog network. It was acquired by Yahoo! in January 2007.  The Yahoo! HotJobs website provided job seekers with a searchable database of job postings from companies across the United States, Canada, and the UK. The site also offered users the ability to create their own resume, post a resume online, and track their job search progress.  As of January 2017, the site no longer operates as a standalone service and has been merged into the Yahoo! Jobs website.

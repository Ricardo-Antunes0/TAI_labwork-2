WWOR EMI Service was a New York City-based record label that was active from 1957 to 1975. The label was founded by jazz and blues singer Ruth Brown and producer Quincy Jones.  WWOR was one of the first black-owned record labels in the United States. It was also one of the first labels to issue soul and funk music, as well as early recordings by Michael Jackson, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Stevie Wonder.  After Jones departed WWOR in 1975, the label went bankrupt. In 1977, it was acquired by Mercury Records.

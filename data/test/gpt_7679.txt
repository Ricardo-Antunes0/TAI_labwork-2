Ouvrage Laudrefang is a lesser work (petit ouvrage) of the Maginot Line, located in the Jardin des Plantes sector of the Moselle d√©partement in northeastern France. Located on the heights of Laudrefang, it was part of a series of fortifications designed to protect the approaches to Metz and Thionville. Construction began in 1931 and was completed in 1935. The ouvrage consisted of two infantry blocks and one artillery block, all connected by a system of underground galleries.   Laudrefang is unusual among the Ouvrages du Maginot for its lack of armament; instead, it was designed to house a single 75 mm gun in its artillery block. The ouvrage was also equipped with two self-propelled howitzers and several smaller artillery pieces. During World War II, Laudrefang served as a headquarters for the 2nd Army Corps. After the war, it was used as a military prison until it was abandoned in 1968. Today, the ouvrage is in a state of disrepair and is only partially accessible to the public.

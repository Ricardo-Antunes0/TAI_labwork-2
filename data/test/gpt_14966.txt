The Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA) is a United States federal law that authorizes the President of the United States to detain certain individuals who are suspected of terrorism or serious crimes. It was passed in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The DTA applies only to individuals who are captured in the course of hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, and does not apply to individuals held as part of normal criminal proceedings.  The DTA allows the President to detain an individual for up to 90 days without charge or trial, provided that the individual is determined by the President to be a terrorist, a member of al-Qaeda, an associated force of al-Qaeda, or a terrorist group. The detention can be extended once for an additional 90 days if the President determines that continued detention is necessary to ensure the safety of U.S. citizens or property. The DTA also authorizes the transfer of detainees to foreign countries for treatment or trial, provided that such countries agree to adhere to U.S. standards on human rights and humanitarianism.

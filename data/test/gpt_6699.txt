Reinhold Knacke (1 January 1919 â€“ 3 January 2002) was a German composer and conductor.  Knacke was born in Berlin, the son of a chemist. He studied music at the Berliner Musikhochschule, where he was initially taught by Ernst Krenek. In 1939, Knacke went to Paris to study with Nadia Boulanger. After the war, he established himself as a conductor in his home country, leading the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra from 1949 until his retirement in 1984. He also served as director of the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival from 1959 to 1984.  Knacke's compositions include operas, symphonies, chamber music, and solo works. He is particularly noted for his innovative use of electronic sound technology in his music, which has led him to be dubbed the "father of electronic music." His works have been performed by leading symphony orchestras around the world, including the Berlin Philharmonic, Cleveland Orchestra, and London Symphony Orchestra.

Vivian Bales (married name Faison, January 1909–December 2001) was the first motorcycle cover girl and was known for several long-distance motorcycle rides around the US, and motorcycle stunt riding, in the 1920s and 1930s. Bales was born in Florida in and raised in Georgia. After leaving school, she worked as a seamstress and dance instructor, and in 1926 bought her first motorcycle, a new Harley-Davidson Model B. She taught herself to ride on this motorcycle, and took her first long tour of 300 miles with a female friend from her home in Albany, Georgia to St. Petersburg, Florida, Florida. The Model B  was a 350 cc,  single cylinder, side-valve, with a manually shifted three speed engine with a battery, and not a magneto ignition, and a fully floating seat. It was brought out to compete with the successful Indian Prince model and was called "the peashooter" for the sound of its exhaust. One of the first 'streamline' models, it sold for around $235.

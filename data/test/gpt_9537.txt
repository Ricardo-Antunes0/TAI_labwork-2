China initiated its "Grain for Green" program in 2007 with the goal of reducing its environmental impact. The program encourages farmers to grow grain instead of using fertilizers, and it provides subsidies to farmers.  The "Grain for Green" program has had a positive effect on the environment. In 2008, China reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 7.5 percent, and the program is credited with helping to reduce emissions by 12 percent in 2009. The program has also helped to improve the livelihoods of farmers, and it has encouraged them to switch from using fertilizers to growing grain.

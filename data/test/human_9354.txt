The Aurora Subdivision or Aurora Sub is a railway line in Wisconsin and Illinois operated by BNSF Railway.  It is part of BNSF's Chicago, Illinois, to Seattle, Washington, Northern Transcon.  This segment runs about  from the St. Croix Subdivision in La Crosse, Wisconsin, to the Chicago Subdivision in Aurora, Illinois. The original line created by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad ran out of Aurora, Illinois to Oregon, Illinois. In 1885, the line was continued from Oregon to connect to St. Paul, Minnesota. From then on, this track hosted some of the fastest trains in the world for the time period, including the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad's Twin Cities Zephyr.  The Northern Pacific North Coast Limited and Great Northern Empire Builder also ran to Minneapolisâ€“Saint Paul and on to the west coast on this track.  However, with the advent of Amtrak in 1971, the Empire Builder changed its route between Chicago and the Twin Cities to run on the route of the former Milwaukee Road Hiawatha instead.

Radiosynthesis is a  fully automated synthesis of  chemical compounds from atomic nuclei using electromagnetic fields.  Radiosynthesis is a process of creating chemical compounds from atomic nuclei using electromagnetic fields. The first step in this process is the absorption of a high energy photon by an atom. This energy is then used to break the nucleus of the atom open, allowing the release of its electrons. These electrons then travel through an electric field, and collide with other atoms, creating new molecules.

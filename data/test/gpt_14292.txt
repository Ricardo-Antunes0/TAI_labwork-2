Duty-free permit (or Duty-free vehicle permit or DFP) is a permit allowing the holder to drive a vehicle without having to pay any duties or taxes on the vehicle. Duty-free permits are generally issued to residents of certain countries who are visiting or living in another country for a certain amount of time.  Duty-free permits are usually issued to citizens of certain countries who are visiting or living in another country for a certain amount of time, but they can also be issued to people who are born in another country but have citizenship in a qualifying country. A duty-free permit is not a visa and does not allow the holder to work.

Insulin resistance (IR) is a pathological condition where the body's cells do not respond to insulin as expected. The result is that blood sugar levels remain high, even when the person consumes normal amounts of food. This can lead to type 2 diabetes and other health problems.  Insulin resistance is a growing problem around the world, and it is believed to be the leading cause of type 2 diabetes. It can occur in people of any age, but it is more common in people over the age of 40. There are many factors that can cause insulin resistance, but the most common are obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and genetic factors.  Insulin resistance can be treated with lifestyle changes, weight loss, and medications such as insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. If left untreated, insulin resistance can lead to type 2 diabetes and other serious health problems such as heart disease, stroke, and liver disease.

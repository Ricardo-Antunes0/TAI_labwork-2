Team Ico was a Japanese video game development studio founded by Hidetaka Miyazaki and his brother, Toshihiro Miyazaki.  Team Ico is best known for developing the PlayStation 2 game "Shadow of the Colossus" with Sony Computer Entertainment Japan Studio. The game was released in 2005 and was well received by video game critics, who praised its graphics and gameplay. The success of "Shadow of the Colossus" led to Team Ico developing two sequels, "The Colossus of Rhodes" and "The Shadow of the Colossus". Team Ico also developed a spin-off game, "Ico & Shadow", which was released in 2009 for the PlayStation Portable.  In February 2014, it was announced that Team Ico dissolved due to creative differences between Hidetaka Miyazaki and Toshihiro Miyazaki.

The Peotone Mill, formerly known as the Peotone Cotton Mills, was a cotton mill located in Peotone, Illinois, United States. The mill was operational from 1871 to 1982. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.  The Peotone Mill was established in 1871 by J.P. and A.L. Peotone as a cotton mill. The mill employed over 1,000 workers at its peak, and produced textiles for both domestic and international markets. The mill was one of the first in Illinois to install the waterjet cutting system. In 1982, the mill closed due to competition from overseas mills. After the mill closed, it was used as a storage facility for various businesses until it burned down in 1995.

Thomas Fletcher Tedder, Ph.D., (born May 14, 1933, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) is a Canadian physicist who has made seminal contributions to wave mechanics and quantum electrodynamics.  Thomas Tedder received his B.A. from the University of Toronto in 1954 and his Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1958. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland from 1958 to 1959 and at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, from 1959 to 1960. He was an assistant professor of physics at McGill University from 1960 to 1962 and an associate professor of physics at Harvard University from 1962 to 1966. He was a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley from 1966 to 1984, when he retired.  In 1964 Tedder and Abdus Salam jointly won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on the theory of quantum electrodynamics. The prize was shared with J. Robert Oppenheimer, who had played a central role in the development of the theory.  Tedder has been a member of the Royal Society since 1966 and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1970. In 1984 he became a fellow of the Royal Society. He was president of the American Physical Society from 1985 to 1986 and has been a member of its Board of Directors since 1988. He is also president-elect of the European Physical Society

Kliment Arkadievich Timiryazev (, surname sometimes transliterated as Timiryazev, Климент Аркадьевич Тимирязев, born May 4, 1878, date of death unknown) was a Russian geneticist who made significant contributions to the study of genetics and heredity.  Born in the town of Oryol in southern Russia, Timiryazev completed his undergraduate studies at the University of St Petersburg in 1901 and then worked as a laboratory assistant under the geneticist Gregor Mendel. In 1904 he completed his doctorate at the University of Vienna and returned to St Petersburg to work as a researcher at the Institute of Experimental Genetics. In 1912 he was appointed professor at the University of Moscow, where he remained until his death.  Timiryazev's greatest contribution to genetics was his development of the theory of genetic inheritance. His work on this topic culminated in his book Genetics and The Gene (1915), which remains one of the most important texts in the field. He also made significant contributions to the study of eugenics and population genetics, and is credited with being one of the founders of modern genetics.  Timiryazev was a recipient of numerous awards and honours, including the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (1928). He died in Moscow in 1934, aged 60.

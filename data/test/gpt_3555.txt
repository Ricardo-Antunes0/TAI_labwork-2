The tourdion (or tordion) (from the French tourdion, meaning tourniquet) is a bowed string instrument with four strings. The modern tourdion was developed in the 16th century in northern Italy and became popular in France and Spain. The instrument is now also used in Brazil, the United States, and elsewhere.  The tourdion is an instrument with four strings, typically played by blowing into a pipe or by plucking the strings with the fingers. The strings are tuned in fourths, like the violin, and the instrument has a sound reminiscent of the violin but is more powerful.

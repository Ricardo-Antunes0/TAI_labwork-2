James Moran was a shipbuilder from St. John's, Newfoundland who built some of the most notable vessels in the early days of the Newfoundland fishery. Moran is particularly known for his schooners, which were versatile and efficient vessels able to navigate the rocky coasts and treacherous bays of Newfoundland.  Born in 1814 in St. John's, James Moran began his career as a shipbuilder at a time when Newfoundland was still a colony of the United Kingdom. Moran built schooners for the fishery, and his vessels were well-known for their speed and strength. He was also one of the first shipbuilders to use iron in his construction, which made his schooners much more durable.  Moran retired from shipbuilding in 1875, but continued to work on private boats until he died in 1892. His legacy lives on in the many beautiful schooners that still sail in Newfoundland waters.

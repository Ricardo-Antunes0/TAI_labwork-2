The Arctic Cordillera is a terrestrial ecozone located in the Arctic regions of North America, Asia, and Europe. The Arctic Cordillera is bounded by the North Atlantic Ocean to the west, the North Pacific Ocean to the east, and the Arctic Ocean to the north.  The Arctic Cordillera is a physiographic province that consists of three major physiographic sections: the Canadian Shield, Interior Alaska, and Coastal Alaska. The Canadian Shield is a largely ancient sedimentary rock formation that covers much of central and eastern Canada. Interior Alaska is made up of younger sedimentary and igneous rocks that were deposited over a period of about 160 million years. Coastal Alaska is made up of younger volcanic and sedimentary rocks that were deposited over a period of about 10 million years.  The Arctic Cordillera has a broad range of habitats including tundra, taiga, boreal forest, high mountain ranges, and lowland wetlands. The tundra occupies areas that have a permafrost layer below 0°C. Taiga is a boreal forest community that occupies areas that have a permafrost layer below 2°C. Boreal forest is a mixedwood community that occupies areas that have a permafrost layer below 4°C. High mountain ranges are located in interior Alaska and consist of peaks above 6,000 feet (1,800 meters). Lowland wetlands are located in coastal Alaska and consist of wetlands that receive more than 50 inches (1,270 millimeters) of rainfall per year.

The Dougherty Mission House is a house located at 18459 Mission Road in Peninsula Township, Michigan.  It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1956 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. The house was certainly one of the first frame buildings constructed in Grand Traverse County, and is thought to be the first post and beam house constructed in Michigan's lower peninsula north of Grand Rapids. History In 1839, the Presbyterian Board of Missions sent Reverend Peter Dougherty to the Grand Traverse area.  He originally chose a site at what is now Elk Rapids, Michigan, and constructed a log church there.  However, in May 1839, Chief Ahgosa of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, asked Dougherty to move to what is now Old Mission, Michigan.  There, Dougherty established a small settlement, moving the mission church from the Elk Rapids site and adding a school and cabins.  In 1840, Dougherty married Maria Higgins of Princeton, New Jersey, and the couple returned to Michigan to live at the Old Mission site.  Peter and Maria Dougherty eventually had nine children born in Michigan

Adeline Werligh (23 December 1813- 11 September 1886) was a Danish artist who specialised in portraits and genre scenes.  Born in Copenhagen, Werligh was the daughter of the landscape painter Wilhelm Werligh and his wife Juliane. She began her training at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1833, but she soon became dissatisfied with the academy's conservative approach to art. In 1838 she travelled to Rome, where she studied under Canova and Correggio.   Back in Denmark, Werligh became one of the most successful portrait painters of her era. She was particularly noted for her beautiful female portraits, which were often based on sketches she made during idle moments. Her most famous work is a series of portraits of Danish princesses, commissioned by their father Frederick VII.  Werligh retired from painting in 1868, but she continued to live and work in Copenhagen until her death a few years later. She is buried at Christiansborg Palace.

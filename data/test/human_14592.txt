Early life and family Sue Anschutz grew up in Russell, Kansas, the daughter of Frederick and Marian Pfister Anschutz. Farming was part of her family's history, as her great-grandfather, Christian Anschutz, was one of the German farmers brought to Russia by Catherine the Great to increase the yield in the Volga River valley. Anschutz eventually left Russia for America and started a farm in Kansas.

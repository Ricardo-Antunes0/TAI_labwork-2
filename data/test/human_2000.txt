Kim Davis, better known by her stage name of Choice or MC Choice, is an American female rapper based out of Houston, Texas. She is best known for her album The Big Payback, which first came out in 1990. Signed to the label Rap-A-Lot Records, her strident, sexually explicit album prefigured the image and sound of later female rappers such as Lil' Kim, with music journalist Roni Sarig mentioning Choice in Third Coast: Outkast, Timbaland, and How Hip-Hop Became a Southern Thing as one of the U.S. south's underground kings and queens of rap alongside the Geto Boys and Street Military. She first appeared on Willie D's 1989 album Controversy (with him then known as "Willie Dee"). The release ended up peaking at #53 on the U.S. R&B Albums chart. Ironically, Choice would soon criticize Willie D in a diss track also aimed at various male MCs of the time (such as Ice Cube).

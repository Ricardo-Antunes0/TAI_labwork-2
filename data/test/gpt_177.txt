Water droplet erosion (WDE) is "a form of weathering that is caused by the action of raindrops or snowflakes on a surface exposed to water." WDE is a type of physical weathering.  Water droplet erosion is a form of weathering that is caused by the action of raindrops or snowflakes on a surface exposed to water. The drops cause tiny tears in the surface layer, which then allows water and other particles to enter and erode the surface. This process can happen quickly on exposed surfaces such as rocks, concrete, and metal, but can also take longer on softer materials, such as soil.  WDE can cause damage to surfaces by removing chunks of material, which can lead to erosion and loss of land or even structural stability. It can also contaminate surfaces with debris and pollutants, which can be harmful to people and animals. WDE is an important process in the natural landscape, and it is important to keep it in mind when planning construction or landscaping projects.

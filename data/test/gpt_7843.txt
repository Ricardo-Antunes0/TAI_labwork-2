Anemone occidentalis, the white pasqueflower or western anemone, is a species of anemone in the family Actinidiaceae. It is found in North America, where it can be found in most of the western United States as well as some parts of Canada.  The white pasqueflower is a popular garden plant, due to its pretty white flowers that are typically borne in large clusters at the top of tall stems. The flowers are pollinated by bees, and the plant is capable of regenerating from offsets.

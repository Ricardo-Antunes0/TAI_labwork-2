Thraco-Macedonian is a conventional name in the field of Ancient Greek and Latin philology for the dialect continuum of the Eastern Macedonian dialects spoken in the region of Macedonia, southern Bulgaria, and northeastern Greece. The name was first introduced in 1879 by the German scholar Friedrich KÃ¼hne.  The Eastern Macedonian dialects are one of the three major dialect groups in the Greek language, together with Pontic and Southern Aegean. They are transitional between the Doric dialects to the north and the Aeolic dialects to the south.  Most Eastern Macedonian speakers reside in Greece, where they make up around 12% of the population. There are also sizable communities in Bulgaria, where they form around 5% of the population, and in Macedonia, where they form around 30% of the population.

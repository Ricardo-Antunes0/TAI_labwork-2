IDT Spectrum, a subsidiary of IDT Corporation, manufactures and markets communications products and services. The company offers a broad range of products and services aimed at the worldwide communications market, including voice and data transmission, broadband access, switching, storage, and transport.  IDT Spectrum traces its origins back to the early 1900s when American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) began providing long-distance telephone service. In the 1970s, AT&T began selling telecommunications equipment to other carriers and began manufacturing its own products. In 1984, AT&T spun off its telecommunications equipment business into a separate company called IDT Corporation.  IDT Spectrum has since grown to be one of the world's leading suppliers of communications products and services. In 2010, the company generated revenues of $19 billion. IDT Spectrum employs more than 73,000 people around the world. The company's headquarters are in Dallas, Texas.

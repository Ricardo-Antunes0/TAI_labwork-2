Wuppertal (;  "Wupper Dale"; named Barmen-Elberfeld from 1929 to 1930; founded in 1929 by the merger of the cities of Elberfeld, Barmen, Ronsdorf, Cronenberg and Vohwinkel) is, with a population of approximately 355,000, the seventh-largest city in North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the 17th-largest city of Germany. It is regarded as the capital and largest city of the Bergisches Land (historically this was Düsseldorf).  The city straddles the densely populated banks of the River Wupper, a tributary of the Rhine called Wipper in its upper course. Wuppertal is located between the Ruhr (Essen) to the north, Düsseldorf to the west, and Cologne to the southwest, and over time has grown together with Solingen, Remscheid and Hagen. The stretching of the city in a long band along the narrow Wupper Valley leads to a spatial impression of Wuppertal being larger than it actually is. The city is known for its steep slopes, its woods and parks, and for being the greenest city in Germany, with two-thirds green space of the total municipal area. From any part of the city, it is only a ten-minute walk to one of the public parks or woodland paths.

Li Song  (died December 12, 948), nickname Dachou , was an official of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period states Later Tang, Later Jin, and Later Han, as well as the Khitan-led Liao dynasty. He was particularly prominent during Later Jin, when he served as chief of staff (Shumishi) and chancellor.  During Later Han, he was falsely accused of treason and executed. Background  It is not known when Li Song was born, but it is known that he was from Raoyang (饒陽, in modern Hengshui, Hebei).  His father Li Shunqing  was the tactical officer at Shen Prefecture (深州, in modern Hengshui), which Raoyang belonged to.  He had at least two younger brothers, Li Yu  and Li Yi (李㠖). Li Shunqing was a descendant of Li Lin (李𬭸). Li Lin said to be 6th generation descendant of Li Yuanyi, Prince Zhenghui (鄭惠王, 李元懿), who was a 13th son of Emperor Gaozu of Tang. It was said that he was intelligent in his youth, and was writing artful texts even when he was in his teenage years, surprising his family members.  Once he reached adulthood, he became an officer at Shen Prefecture.  (Historical descriptions do not give dates, or even the sovereigns that he was under, during these events.)

Notch homolog 2 N-terminal-like is a family of proteins that are found in the cytoplasm of cells. They are thought to be involved in proteinâ€“protein interactions, as well as in the regulation of cell cycle progression. Notch proteins are members of the notch family, which is a group of proteins that share a common sequence motif known as the Notch domain. The notch family is composed of four members: Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, and Notch4.

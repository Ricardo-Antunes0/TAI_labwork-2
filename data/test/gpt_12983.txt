Simon bar Giora was born in 1840 in the village of Metula, in the Galilee region of Ottoman Syria. He was a member of a prominent family of rabbis and scholars. In 1875 he led a group of Jewish rebels against Ottoman rule, and after several failed attempts to capture Jerusalem, he was captured by the Ottomans and executed in 1881.  Simon bar Giora is best known for his role in leading a series of armed rebellions against Ottoman rule in the late 19th century. He is also well known for his role in the First and Second Aliyah, which saw a large influx of Jews to Palestine from Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe.

William Arbuckle "Bill" Reid (1933 â€“ 2 September 2015) was a British curriculum theorist. Born in Gloucestershire, Reid obtained his BA degree in languages from Cambridge University, after which he taught in English high schools. He went on to conduct curriculum research at the University of Birmingham, where he obtained his PhD and subsequently taught MEd students.  He took early retirement from the University of Birmingham in 1988 and was appointed as a visiting professor at the London Institute of Education, and subsequently the University of Texas, Austin.  He also undertook collaborative projects with colleagues at the University of Oslo and taught summer schools at the University of Victoria, British Columbia. Some of his reminiscences were published in 2009 in "Leaders in Curriculum Studies", edited by E.C. Short and Leonard J. Waks (Sense Publishers, Rotterdam, 2009). In retirement he self-published pamphlets and books concerning archaeology and other local history in his native Cotswold landscape, as well as memoirs, articles on chess, books of poems and a novel. A series of articles published in "Glevensis", a journal of the Gloucestershire Archaeological Society were formed into a self-published book (Chantry Press; Windmill Print and Graphics) entitled "From Roman to Saxon in a Cotswold Landscape" (2006).

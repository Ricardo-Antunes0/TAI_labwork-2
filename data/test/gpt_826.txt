The bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) is a small North American bird, a member of the sparrow family.  The bobolink is the smallest North American songbird and has the shortest bill of any landbird. It is about 20 cm long, with a wingspan of about 35 cm. The male has a glossy black head and back, a white throat, and a blue-green breast. The female is similar but has more brown on the head and less blue in the breast. The bobolink's call is a plaintive wail.  The bobolink is found in most of Canada and the eastern United States, as well as in parts of Mexico. Its natural habitats are temperate mixed forests and brushy areas.

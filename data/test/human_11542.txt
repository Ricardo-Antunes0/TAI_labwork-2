Morgan the Escapist is a magic performer specialising in escapology. She is based in South Plainfield, New Jersey, USA, and often works with the magician John Bundy. She has also had careers as a theatrical designer and script writer. In October 2009, she received the title "Best female escape artist" at the World Magic Awards. Biography Morgan has stated that her magic career owes a lot to early inspiration drawn from seeing Dorothy Dietrich perform on television. After an education in theatre and graphic arts, Morgan worked in a touring magic show and then in a professional theatre. In addition to performing and stage managing at the theater she learned to direct and was the resident graphic artist. In 1994, she was chosen to study at the Jim Henson Studios in New York. The same year she met Bundy and later became his assistant in his successful and long-running show, Spooktackular. She then developed an escape-based act in her own right whilst continuing her successful involvement in Bundy's productions. Her signature tricks include the Table of Death.

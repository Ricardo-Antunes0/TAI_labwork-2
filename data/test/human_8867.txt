Caquenga's Revolt was a revolt that occurred in 1607 in modern-day Rizal, Cagayan. The leader of the revolt was Caquenga, an animist priestess who acted as a spiritual head of her Malaueg community, which was a village named Nalfotan. The coming of a Dominican friar, Fray Pedro, into Nalfotan triggered the revolt that spread throughout the surrounding region. Background With the creation of the Nueva Segovia diocese in 1595 in the Cagayan Valley, Catholic missionaries from Europe began flooding into the region to convert the indigenous inhabitants to the Catholic faith. Per the Dominican account, Pagulayan, the chief of Nalfotan, had tried contacting Catholic missionaries for years. Fray Pedro then accepted the invitation and went to Nalfotan to visit Pagulayan and the Malaueg people. To his astonishment, he found a church erected and the people waiting to adopt the religion. However, Caquenga, an indigenous animist leader, or priestess, apprehended the coming of the friar. Christianity posed a threat to her indigenous animism, and Catholic missionaries and Spanish officials worked continuously to eradicate animism. In response to this threat against her spiritual beliefs, she gathered a group of followers and they revolted against the priest.

Sophar Rangoon ( â€“ 22 January 1890) was the son of a Chief of the Kingdom of Ava (Burma). At around age eight Sophar was taken by Captain Frederick Marryat during the First Anglo-Burmese War . When Captain Marryat returned to England he gave Sophar as a gift to Prince Augustus Frederick, the Duke of Sussex. "Soon after his return Captain Marryat lent his Burmese trophies and curios for an exhibition at the Royal Asiatic Society, the most spectacular exhibit being a golden statue of the King of Ava set with rubies... and he was as prodigial as the traditional sailor with his generosity in giving such valuable gifts to friends. The most unusual gift was that of an eight-year-old Burmese boy, whom he had brought home in his ship; said to be a chieftan's son, Sofar was presented to the King's brother and sixth son of King George III, the  Duke of Sussex, as a page and was soon to be seen at Kensington Palace and Windsor Castle."

Loyd Hayden Riley (September 14, 1921 – March 10, 2001) was an American mathematician who made significant contributions to the theory of Lie groups, linear algebra, and differential equations. He is also credited with designing the first computer algorithm for solving systems of linear equations.  Riley was born in 1921 in Clinton, Oklahoma. He obtained his bachelor's degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1942 and his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1948. After a year of post-doctoral research at the California Institute of Technology, he joined the faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he remained for the rest of his career.  Riley made significant contributions to the theory of Lie groups, linear algebra, and differential equations. He is also credited with designing the first computer algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. His most famous result is the so-called Riley–Bruenker–Chebyshev theorem, which states that a Lie group has a unique normal subgroup that is isomorphic to a certain Lie supergroup. Riley was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974 and a Member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1978. He died in 2001 at the age of 80

Boudougate is a political scandal in Argentina involving the president of Argentina, Mauricio Macri. It began on 2 December 2015, when Jorge Lanata, a journalist with the TV program Periodismo Para Todos, broadcast an interview with Carlos Zannini, a former minister of economy in the government of NÃ©stor Kirchner. Zannini had testified before the Senate about a scheme to award public contracts to businessmen close to Macri.  In the interview, Zannini claimed that Macri had known about and approved of the scheme. This accusation quickly became known as Boudougate, after Economy Minister Florencio Randazzo's nickname, "Boudou". On 4 December, Lanata released a video in which he revealed that he had recorded the interview without Zannini's knowledge.  On 7 December, Macri was questioned by the Senate about the allegations. He denied any knowledge of or involvement in the scheme. On 14 December, Lanata published another interview with Zannini in which Zannini claimed that he had recordings of conversations between Macri and businessmen involved in the scheme. On 15 December, Lanata confirmed that he had also obtained recordings of these conversations.  On 16 December, Kirchner made a televised speech in which he implicated Macri in Boudougate. The next day, 16 December 2015, Macri resigned as president of Argentina.

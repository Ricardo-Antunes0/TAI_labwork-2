Kryostega is a large temnospondyl amphibian from the Late Triassic of South Africa. It is the only known species in its genus and family, and is the largest known temnospondyl. Kryostega was aboutlong and had a long, conical skull covered in small bumps. Its limbs are short and robust, and it had a long tail that it used to prop itself up on its back when swimming.  Kryostega was a very specialized animal: it was the only known temnospondyl that could glide through the water by using its long tail to control its body position. It could also use its limbs to prop itself up when swimming, which made it very efficient at moving through water. Kryostega was also one of the first animals to evolve true teeth: rather than having sharp teeth that were used to shear meat, Kryostega's teeth were flattened into plates that were used to grind food.

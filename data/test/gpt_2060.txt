Roger George Kennedy (August 3, 1926 â€“ April 7, 2009) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 43rd Attorney General of the United States from 1961 to 1963 and as a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts from 1960 to 1988.  Kennedy was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, one of four children of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. His siblings were Joseph Jr., John F. Kennedy, and Robert F. Kennedy. He attended the prestigious Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut and then Harvard College, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1946. Kennedy attended the University of Virginia Law School, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review. He served in the United States Army Reserve from 1946 to 1948 and then entered private practice in Boston.  Kennedy was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1958, succeeding his father after he was appointed United States Ambassador to the United Nations by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He served for almost thirty years before being elected attorney general in 1961, defeating incumbent Republican Edward M. Brooke. As attorney general, Kennedy pursued civil rights cases, including Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared racial segregation in schools unconstitutional; and Miranda v. Arizona (1966), which clarified the rights of criminal suspects who are questioned by law enforcement officers. He also presided over the prosecution of members of the John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy

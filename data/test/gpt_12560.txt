Heart failure (HF), also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), is a condition in which the heart is not able to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. The most common symptom of HF is shortness of breath, but it can also cause chest pain, fatigue, and poor exercise performance. HF is a leading cause of death in the United States, and it can occur at any age. There is no known cure for HF, but treatment focuses on relieving the symptoms and preventing further damage to the heart.

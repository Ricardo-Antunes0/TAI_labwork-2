Madanpur is a census town in Kalyani Community Development Block in the Kalyani subdivision of the Nadia district in the Indian state of West Bengal. History  In the middle of the eighteenth century when the railways were yet to come to Bengal, the present day area of Madanpur (situated on the bank of river Ganges) was full of grassland. The current station area was located entirely in the river bed. People started to reside here after 1750. The origins of the name 'Madanpur' maybe traced to a popular myth in which Thakur Madangopal who accompanied with Sri Radha took rest at this place on their way to Krishnanagar. The people of the village were very much happy with this and they started worshipping Lord Madangopal. From then on people started calling this place 'Madanpur' which means the place of Madangopal. Even today, there still remains the temple of Thakur Madangopal near Birohi.

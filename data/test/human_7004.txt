Nánabeszter or Nána-Beszter (Nanabezter) was the name of a minor gens (Latin for "clan"; nemzetség in Hungarian) in the Kingdom of Hungary, which mostly possessed lands along the river Danube in Central Hungary, around the capitals Esztergom and Buda. After their only known branch, which existed until the early 14th century, the clan was also known as Berki family. Social status 19th-century historian János Karácsonyi considered the clan rose from the social status of castle warriors to the Hungarian nobility, while his contemporary, Mór Wertner identified them of noble origin. György Györffy excluded  them from the list of kindreds of castle warrior origin too. Although they were referred to as "iobaiones" ("serfs") in 1228, when the kindred first appeared in historical documents, historian Attila Zsoldos argued there is no indication that any member of the clan was in the service in the system of castle districts in Hungary. It is possible that a certain Nana (I), who served as ispán of the udvornici in Esztergomváralja (a settlement at the foot of Esztergom Castle) in 1184, belonged to this kindred. In his later monograph, Zsoldos considered the early members of the Nánabeszter clan were initially royal servants, who were subordinate only to the king and rose to the nobility due to their loyalty and faithful service.

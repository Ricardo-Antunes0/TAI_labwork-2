Nine-ball (sometimes written 9-ball) is a discipline of pool playing, with nine balls and a cue ball. The object of the game is to pocket as many balls as possible without going out, by sinking the cue ball into the pool at least once.  Nine-ball is one of the most popular pool games, with millions of players around the world. It is played with a standard pool table and uses the same rules as nine-ball pool except for the addition of a ninth ball, which is worth half a point. Nine-ball can be played as a single game, or as part of a tournament.

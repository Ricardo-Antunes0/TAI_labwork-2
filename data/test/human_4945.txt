The Kahlert Mercantile Store is a historic commercial building in Browerville, Minnesota, United States.  It was built in 1883 as Browerville was springing up around a newly built railroad line.  The simple wooden building with a false front contained retail space on the ground floor and a community meeting hall upstairs.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 for having local significance in the themes of commerce and exploration/settlement.  It was nominated for being a highly intact example of the vernacular commercial architecture erected in Minnesota's railroad boomtowns. Description The Kahlert Mercantile Store is a two-story wood-frame building with a  footprint.  It has the squared-off false front typical of 19th-century rural and frontier towns.  However the second floor rises a full story to accommodate the meeting hall, whereas most such buildings had a truncated upper floor.  The Kahlert Store lacks any basement.  The building is covered in clapboard siding broken by two-over-two sash windows.

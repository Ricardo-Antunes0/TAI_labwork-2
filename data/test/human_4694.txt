The Dusit Thani Bangkok, often referred to simply as the Dusit Thani Hotel , was a luxury hotel in the Thai capital's Bang Rak District. The original hotel was the country's tallest building when it opened in 1970 as the first property of Dusit International. The building was demolished for redevelopment from 2019 to 2020, and a new hotel with the same name is scheduled to open on the site in 2023. History The Dusit Thani hotel was founded by hotelier Thanphuying Chanut Piyaoui. It was her second hotel after the Princess Hotel on Charoen Krung Road, which opened in 1948 and expanded as Bangkok's hospitality industry grew during the Cold War period. Thanphuying Chanut conceived the Dusit Thani as an internationally recognised luxury hotel to compete with the Siam Inter-Continental Hotel, which had opened in 1966. On a visit to the Hotel Okura in Tokyo, she became impressed with the hotel's design, and enlisted Japanese architect Yozo Shibata, who had worked on the design team for the Okura, to design her new hotel. Construction was supervised by Tokyo-based C. Itoh, while Thai Obayashi served as the main contractor. The name Dusit Thani was borrowed from King Rama VI's miniature city project which experimented with democracy during the 1920s.

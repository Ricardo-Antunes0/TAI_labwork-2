The Suqour al-Sham Brigades , also known as the Levant Liberation Brigade or the Sham Legion is a Syrian rebel group operating in the northwestern Idlib province. The brigades consists of Syrian Sunni Muslim militants and has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Turkey, and Russia.  Formed in October 2011, Suqour al-Sham Brigades initially consisted of around 300 fighters who were mostly drawn from the Al-Nusra Front and the Free Syrian Army. The brigades played an important role in the early stages of the Syrian Civil War, staging numerous attacks against government forces and providing crucial support to rebel groups in Idlib province. However, in recent years the brigades have suffered from infighting and a lack of support from other rebel groups. In May 2017, Suqour al-Sham Brigades merged with Ahrar al-Sham to form Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.

Terrance Michael Caffery (born April 1, 1949) is an American serial killer, rapist, and kidnapper who was active from the late 1960s to the early 1980s. Caffery is also a suspect in the disappearances of several other women during that time period.  Caffery was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to a working-class Irish-American family. He spent much of his early life living in poverty and running with a rough crowd. His criminal record began at the age of 15, when he was convicted of armed robbery. He served time in prison and was released in 1967.  Caffery's criminal activities escalated in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He is responsible for at least eight murders and five rapes during this time period. His most notorious case occurred in 1971, when he kidnapped and raped a 17-year-old girl. Caffery was eventually arrested and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. He is currently serving his sentence at the Maryland Correctional Institution, Jessup.  Caffery's suspected involvement in the disappearances of several other women during this time period has generated significant media attention. However, he has never been charged with any of these crimes and there is currently no evidence linking him to any of them.

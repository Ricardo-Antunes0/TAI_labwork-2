The Seng-gut narrative is a Korean shamanic storytelling tradition that is often used to convey the spiritual beliefs and practices of shamanic cultures. The term "seng-gut" is a compound of the words "seng" (spirit) and "gut" (story), and is used to describe the Oral Tradition of Korean shamanism in general.  The Seng-gut narrative is composed of short stories or folktales, which are often connected to one another through motifs or common characters. They are often performed by shamans or storytellers during shamanic ceremonies or festivals, and are also used as educational tools to teach children about the spiritual world.  The Seng-gut narrative has been influenced by various cultures and traditions, including the Buddhist and Confucian religions. It is believed that the seng-gut narrative originated with the ancient Korean kingdom of Silla, and has since been passed down through the generations.

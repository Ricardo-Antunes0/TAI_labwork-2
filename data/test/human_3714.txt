Eitan Tadmor (born May 4, 1954) is a distinguished university professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, known for his contributions to the theory and computation of PDEs with diverse applications to shock wave, kinetic transport, incompressible flows, image processing, and self-organized collective dynamics. Academic biography  Tadmor completed his mathematical studies (B.Sc., 1973, M.Sc., 1975, Ph.D., 1978) at Tel-Aviv University. In 1980-1982 he was a Bateman Research Instructor in Caltech. He returned to his alma mater, and held professorship positions at Tel-Aviv University during 1983â€“1998, where he chaired the Department of Applied Mathematics (1991-1993). He moved to UCLA (1995-2002), where he was the founding co-director of the NSF Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) (1999-2001). In 2002 he joined the University of Maryland, College Park, serving as the founding Director of the University Center for Scientific Computation and Mathematical Modeling (CSCAMM), (2002-2016). He is on the faculty of the Department of Mathematics, the Institute for Physical Sciences and Technology and CSCAMM. In 2012 he was awarded as the PI of the NSF Research network "Kinetic Description of Emerging Challenges in Natural Sciences" (KI-Net), (2012-2018).

The SkyHook JHL-40 was a proposed hybrid helicopter/LAPV designed by Skyhook International in the late 1990s. It was intended as a successor to the unsuccessful SkyHook JHL-25, and was to use a single main rotor and two pusher rotors to provide lift.  The SkyHook JHL-40 was cancelled in 1999, although design work continued on the project until 2002.

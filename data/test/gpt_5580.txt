Rock Steady Live is a video album by the British rock band The Who. It was recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon in London on 20 and 21 December 1978 and released in 1979.  The Who were on tour in support of their album, "The Who by Numbers" (1978) when they played two shows at the Hammersmith Odeon on 20 and 21 December 1978. The shows were recorded for a live album, but because of disagreements between the band and their record label, it was not released until 1979.  The album consists of performances from both shows, with no edits made. However, several tracks from the first show were cut from the final release because they were not well received by the audience.  The album has been reissued several times since its initial release. A remastered version was released in 2002, followed by a deluxe edition in 2007. A 3-disc box set was released in 2013 which included both remastered and previously unreleased material from the 1978 tour.  "Rock Steady Live" has been generally well-received by music critics. It has been praised for its sound quality, as well as for its performances by The Who. However, it has also been criticized for its lack of originality and its uneven quality.

A flexion teardrop fracture is a fracture of the distal radius, typically caused by a fall on an outstretched hand. It is a common pediatric fracture, occurring in about 1 in 1000 children. The fracture is typically seen as an isolated event and does not typically require surgery. Treatment typically consists of immobilization and analgesia.

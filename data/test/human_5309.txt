Stephen Nelson Haskell (April 22, 1833 â€“ 1922) was an evangelist, missionary and editor in the Seventh-day Adventist Church who became one of the pioneers of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the South Pacific. Personal life He was born in Oakham, Massachusetts on April 22, 1833. He converted himself to Christianism at the age of 15 when he joined the Congregational church. When he was 17 years old, while working in a farm, the owner on his deathbed, asked him before he died to take care of his 38-year-old sister who was paraplegic due to illness. After thinking about this, he accepted and he thought that the best way to look after her was marrying her. By this time, he and Mary were Methodists. Eventually, a couple of years later, Mary Haskell's health improved and was able to walk again. He had been married for two years when he heard about the imminent second coming of Jesus according to Millerite preachings and soon embraced this hope. Haskell started telling everyone about the Adventist message and even a friend of him invited to preach. As a soap manufacturer and dealer, he had to travel a lot, which gave him the chance of meeting people and making new friends wherever he went. After the death of Mary Haskell in 1894 at the age of 81, Stephen spent the next five years as a missionary in Africa and Australia. Intensely lonely and often depressed after Mary's death, he drew much encouragement from the letters of Ellen White. He received more letters from her than any other person outside her immediate family. Eventually he proposed marriage to her [as she was widowed] but she declined, suggesting instead that Hetty Hurd would make a good companion for him.

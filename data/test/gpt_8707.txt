Beit al-Tutunji is an early nineteenth-century historic mosque in the Old City of Jerusalem.  The mosque was commissioned by Muhammad al-Qasim, a local Muslim dignitary who served as the governor of Jerusalem in the early nineteenth century. The building is a relatively small and simple structure, with an entrance on the southeast corner and a dome topped by a small minaret. The mosque was extensively renovated in the 1990s, and currently serves as the headquarters of the Islamic Waqf.

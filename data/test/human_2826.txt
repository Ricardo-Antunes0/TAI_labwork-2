Alister Clark (1864–1949) was the best known and most influential Australian rose breeder. His roses were the most widely planted in Australia between the World Wars and made an enduring difference to the appearance of Australian cities. His experiments hybridising Rosa gigantea were in world class and have never been surpassed. Biography Alister Clark was the son of an immigrant Scottish tenant farmer who did well in Australia, leaving his family with several outback cattle stations, as well as "Glenara", a big property in a valley at Bulla, north of Melbourne. Clarke and his siblings  received a genteel upbringing and knew Europe well: Clark was educated at Loretto School in Scotland and at Jesus College, Cambridge. He married a New Zealander with a fortune and never worked, giving himself over to the business of being a gentleman: huntsman, polo player, racehorse owner, golfer, photographer — and rose breeder. He began his rose breeding by ordering roses from Paul & Son in England; later they came from the Nabonnand nursery at Golfe-Juan on the French Riviera. Between 1912 and his death, Clark released about 150 roses, usually through the garden and sporting clubs to which he gave the royalties.

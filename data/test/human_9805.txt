The Luoyang–Zhanjiang railway or Luozhan railway , is a major rail corridor in China between Luoyang, Henan Province on the Yellow River in the Central Plain, and Zhanjiang, Guangdong Province on the South China Sea.  The rail corridor runs through four provinces and one autonomous region—Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi and Guangdong—and is designed to facilitate the shipment of goods from the Chinese interior to the Port of Zhanjiang.  The rail corridor was proposed in 1999 and is a combination of preexisting railways and new railway sections built for the Luozhan railway.  The new railway sections fill a gap in the railway network of South Central China between the Beijing-Guangzhou and Jiaozuo–Liuzhou railways.  In eastern Guangxi, the Luozhan railway forks at the town of Cenxi and follows two routes to Zhanjiang.  The Luoyang–Zhanjiang Rail corridor's total length has been reported as  to . Route The Luozhan line is composed of seven sections, consisting of three preexisting railways built prior to 1999, and four new railway sections built for the Luozhan line.   	 From Luoyang, the line follows the preexisting Jiaozuo–Liuzhou railway to Shimen in northern Hunan Province.  From Shimen, the line follows the preexisting Shimen–Changsha railway through Changde to Yiyang, in north central Hunan.  From Yiyang, a new  railway to Yongzhou in southern Hunan via Loudi and Shaoyang was completed in 2006. From Yongzhou, a new,  railway to Yulin in eastern Guangxi Autonomous Region via Lingling, Dao County, Jianghua, Fuchuan, Zhongshan County, Hezhou, Wuzhou, Cenxi, Rong County (Guangxi) and Beiliu, was built from December 2004 to July 2009. From Yulin, the line follows the preexisting Litang–Zhanjiang railway to Zhanjiang, in southwestern Guangdong Province. The Luozhan Line also takes a more direct route to Zhanjiang via Cenxi and Maoming.    From Cenxi, just north of Yulin, in eastern Guangxi, a  single-track electrified section to Maoming in neighboring Guangdong via Xinyi and Gaozhou opened on January 3, 2011. From Maoming, a  section to Zhanjiang, opened on December 28, 2013.

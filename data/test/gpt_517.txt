Platform envelopment refers to one platform provider's ability to control the entire supply chain for a specific product or service, from design and development to manufacture and delivery. By exerting such control, the platform provider can optimize the process for its own benefit, while also reducing the costs and risks associated with the production and delivery of the product or service.  The term platform envelopment has been used in business since at least the late 1990s, when vendors such as Microsoft and Dell began to dominate the market for personal computer systems. In recent years, platform envelopment has become a major focus of business scholars and economists, as companies such as Google, Apple, and Amazon have begun to exert increasing control over a wide range of markets.  Platform envelopment raises a number of important questions for businesses: How can platforms be successfully exploited by providers of products and services? What are the implications for competition and innovation? How should companies respond when their rivals become dominant players in a market?  Despite its complex implications, platform envelopment is a relatively new topic in business research. This article provides an overview of the concept, discusses some of its key applications in business, and offers some insights into how businesses can best respond when their rivals become dominant players in a market.

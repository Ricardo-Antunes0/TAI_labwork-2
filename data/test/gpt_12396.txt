David Rubinger (; 29 June 1924 â€“ 23 November 2001) was a pioneering Israeli mathematician and computer scientist. He was the first to develop the theory of decision diagrams and to propose the use of probabilistic algorithms for decision making.  David Rubinger was born in Vienna, Austria on 29 June 1924. He was educated at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, obtaining his doctorate in 1955. He became a professor at the Hebrew University in 1965, and retired in 1996. Rubinger also held visiting positions at universities in Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, and the United States.  Rubinger is best known for his work in decision theory and probabilistic algorithms, particularly his theory of decision diagrams and his proposal of the use of probabilistic algorithms for decision making. His work has had a profound impact on both mathematics and computer science, and has helped to shape the way that these fields approach problem solving.  Rubinger died on 23 November 2001 at the age of 80.

Bessarabian (foaled 1982 in Pennsylvania) is a Thoroughbred racehorse who has won four major races in North America. After winning two Grade I races and finishing second in the other two, Bessarabian was voted American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly in 1986. She then won the inaugural running of the Breeders' Cup Distaff, defeating several high-class opponents including Mine That Bird, winner of the 1987 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes.  Bessarabian's racing career was cut short by a tendon injury in 1990 but she had a successful breeding career, producing several successful runners including Tudor Minstrel, winner of the 2003 Grade 1 Travers Stakes.

Viral load, also known as viral burden, is the number of copies of a virus in a cell or body tissue. It is an indicator of the severity of an illness caused by a virus and is used to plan the treatment.  Viral load can be assessed through a variety of methods, including viral culture,copy number assay, or polymerase chain reaction. Treatment options depend on the virus and the individual's symptoms. In general, the goal of treatment is to reduce the viral load to undetectable levels.

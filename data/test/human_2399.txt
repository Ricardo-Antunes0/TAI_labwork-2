Early on he wrestled under the ring name Cobrita Oriental ("Little Asian Cobra"). Later on he would adopt the ring name Fantastico II, teaming with Fantastico I to form Los Fantasticos. It has not been confirmed that Fantastico I was his brother, but later on the two did team together. In 2005/2006 he adopted the name Ángel Azteca Jr. and his brother began wrestling as Ángel Azteca II, both having paid the original Ángel Azteca for the rights to use the name. The original Ángel Azteca even returned to the ring to help jumpstart the careers of Ángel Azteca Jr. and Ángel Azteca II. The original Ángel Azteca died in early 2007, after which Ángel Azteca II changed his ring name to Imperio Azteca while Ángel Azteca Jr. kept his name as an homage to his mentor. Since the death of Ángel Azteca promoters have been very careful not to bill Ángel Azteca Jr. as the actual son of the original and more of his successor.

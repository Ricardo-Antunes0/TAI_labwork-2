The Račak massacre  or Račak operation was a massacre of Bosniaks that took place on the night of 31 August to 1 September 1995, during the Bosnian War. It was committed by the Croat military and paramilitary forces of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) and Croatian National Guard (ZNG) against Bosniak civilian population in the village of Račak in eastern Bosnia. The operation killed at least 78 people and wounded more than 100, who were rounded up and shot dead.  The massacre was part of a larger campaign conducted by the Croatian forces against the Bosniak population in eastern Bosnia. The Bosnian government accused the Croatian forces of deliberately targeting civilians, while the Croats claimed that they were merely responding to attacks by Bosniaks on their troops.

The mandibular first premolar is the tooth located in the front of the mandible. It is the first tooth in the upper jaw and is situated between the molar teeth on the lateral (or outer) side of the mandible.  The mandibular first premolar has a convex crown and a concave base. The crown is wider than it is deep, and has a triangular shape. The tooth's surface is smooth, although there may be some ridges on its surface. The mandibular first premolar measures 3.5 to 4.0 mm wide and 2.5 to 3.0 mm deep.  The mandibular first premolar is generally fairly strong and can withstand a great deal of wear and tear. However, if it becomes damaged, it may need to be replaced with a new tooth.

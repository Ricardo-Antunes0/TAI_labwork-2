"Delay Box" is a common slang term for a music player with a feature that allows the user to increase the delay time of the music. The delay box is often used in electronic music to create a thick, reverberant sound.  The delay box has a number of different features that allow the user to control the delay time and create different effects. Some of the common features include: a tempo slider to control the speed of the delay, a reverse slider to create a backwards delay effect, and a range slider to control the length of the delay. Some delay boxes also have an amplitude knob to adjust the volume of the delay effect.

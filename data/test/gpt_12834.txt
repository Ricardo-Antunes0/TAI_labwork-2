Consequentialist libertarianism, also known as consequentialist liberalism, is a philosophy which holds that the only rational basis for action is the maximization of good consequences. It is a form of ethical libertarianism.  Consequentialist libertarianism arose in the mid-20th century as a reaction against the classical liberalism of thinkers such as John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer, which placed an undue emphasis on individual freedom and liberty. In contrast, consequentialist libertarians argue that freedom and liberty are not ultimate ends in themselves, but are instead means to the end of achieving the greatest possible aggregate good. This is sometimes referred to as "the principle of effective freedom".  As with any ethical theory, there are a number of different interpretations of consequentialist libertarianism, with some theorists placing more emphasis on consequences achieved through individual actions, while others place more emphasis on collective actions.

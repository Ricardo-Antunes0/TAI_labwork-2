A Gaelscoil (; plural: Gaelscoileanna) is an Irish-language dual-language primary school.  The Irish government has legislated for the establishment of Gaelscoileanna since the early 1990s, in response to a perceived need for more Irish-speaking primary schools in the Republic of Ireland. The first Gaelscoileanna opened in 1994 in Dublin. Currently, there are over 150 Gaelscoileanna in Ireland, as well as a number of overseas Gaelscoileanna.  Gaelscoileanna operate under the auspices of the Irish Department of Education and Science and are state-funded. They are typically autonomous bodies within their respective communities, with their own boards of management and staff. They adhere to the national curriculum and enjoy autonomy in regards to admissions policies and curricular content.  Gaelscoileanna are often associated with Gaelic football, as many of their pupils take up the sport at secondary level. However, the school is not limited to Gaelic games; pupils can participate in a variety of sports and activities based on their interests and abilities.

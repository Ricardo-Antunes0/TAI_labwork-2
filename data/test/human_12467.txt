Adcote School is a non-selective independent day and boarding school for girls, located in the village of Little Ness,  northwest of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England. The school was founded in 1907, and is set in a Grade I listed country house built in 1879 for Rebecca Darby, the widow of Alfred Darby I (1807â€“52) and a great niece of Abraham Darby. The Darbys were the iron-master family who built Ironbridge. The school has a Junior School that takes girls aged 7 to 11, a Senior School for girls aged 11 to 16 and a Sixth Form taking girls from 16 to 19. As of April 2016, the school is owned by IQ Education (IQE), a Chinese backed education company based in Birmingham. The school transferred from a charity to a limited company status, managed by IQ Schools Group. The school is a sister school to Myddelton College in Denbigh, owned by the same company.

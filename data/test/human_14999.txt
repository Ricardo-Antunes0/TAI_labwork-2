History  The gymnasium school type in the Netherlands originates from the “Latijnse school” (Latin school), a medieval school type for the upper class where Latin, an essential language for studying at university, was taught. The school originates from the in 1342 established “Hoofdschool”, which in the 16th century became the “Latijnse School”, which in turn became the “Amsterdam Stedelijk Gymnasium” in 1847. In the thirties of the 20th century, the Gymnasium school type became so popular that a second public gymnasium had to be founded in Amsterdam. Thus in 1926 the “Amsterdam Stedelijk Gymnasium” was split into the Barlaeus Gymnasium and the Vossius Gymnasium with the latter claiming the earlier dates of foundation.

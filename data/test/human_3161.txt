The Adler Primus is a small family car introduced by the Frankfurt based auto-maker, Adler in March 1932.    In a move reminiscent of British Leyland in the 1970s, Adler launched two similarly sized cars in the same year, one of which followed the then new trend set by DKW for front-wheel drive, and one respecting the conventional rear-wheel drive configuration still used by the market leader, Opel. The Primus was the first of the smaller Adlers to be introduced, early in 1932, and was the rear wheel drive offering; Adler Trumpf was the other. The conservative design was the responsibility of Otto Göckeritz, the man who had designed the company's first small car back in 1906.   The 1932 Primus was effectively a scaled down version of the manufacturer’s  Standard 6 of 1927, applying the same high bodied design with a simple “overslung” chassis on which the car's rigid axles fitted underneath the principal loadbearing lengths of the chassis.

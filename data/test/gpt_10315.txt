Lubachevsky-Stillinger (compression) algorithm (LS algorithm, LSA, or Stillinger algorithm) is a powerful data compression algorithm used in various communication and storage applications.  The Lubachevsky-Stillinger algorithm is an iterative algorithm for data compression. It was developed by Yuri Lubachevsky and Alfred Stillinger in the early 1960s. It is one of the most popular data compression algorithms, being used in a wide range of applications, including email, image compression, and software distribution.  The LSA is a fast compression algorithm that achieves good compression ratios with modest memory requirements. It has been widely implemented in software and hardware, and is well suited for a variety of applications, including video and audio compression.

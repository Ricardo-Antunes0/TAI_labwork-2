Set in the small town of Roswell, New Mexico, in 1951, the film tells the story of a murder and its aftermath. Sheriff James T. Lee (Sterling Hayden) is investigating the death of a young girl, which has all the hallmarks of a typical murder case. However, he is met with resistance from the townspeople, who are not willing to believe that a local could have committed such a crime. Lee's investigation leads him to discover that the girl was actually killed by an extraterrestrial being known as "The Killer". The Killer has been stalking and killing people in Roswell for years, and Lee must stop him before he kills again.

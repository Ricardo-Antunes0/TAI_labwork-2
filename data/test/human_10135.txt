Maria Johansdotter, or Maja Jansdotter, also known as Magnus Johansson (fl. 1706), was a Swedish spelman (a player of Swedish folk music) and parish clerk. She was the first woman parish clerk in Sweden. She was put on trial for homosexuality and for having posed as a man in 1705. Life Maria Johansdotter arrived in Stockholm from Ã…land with her stepfather during the Great Northern War. She later stated, that in her home parish she often dressed in trousers and performed both male and female tasks. In Stockholm, she performed tasks normally given to men on farms outside of the capital. She also became a well known musician in the capital, when she played the harp as a spelman on the taverns of Gamla stan. Although she wore trousers, she still used her female name. One evening, she was given a passport under the male name Magnus Johansson by a guest at a tavern. After this, she dressed completely in male clothing and stated to her employer that she was a hermaphrodite and would henceforth live as a man. She later moved to another part of the city's surroundings where she was unknown as a woman.

David Anton Randall (5 April 1905 â€“ 25 May 1975) was an American book dealer, librarian and bibliographic scholar.  He was head of Scribner's rare book department from 1935 to 1956, librarian of the Lilly Library and Professor of Bibliography at Indiana University.  Randall was responsible for the sale of two copies of the Gutenberg Bible. As a practitioner of bibliology with a bibliophiliac addiction, a raconteur of history of books, and an avid collector, he developed a keen appreciation for books as physical objectsincluding the tasks of collecting, cataloging, finding and preserving them. Early life  Randall was born in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania and educated at Harrisburg Academy (graduated 1924) then Lehigh University from which he graduated with a B.A. degree in English in 1928. He began to study law at Harvard but dropped out after one term after attending George Parker Winship's course on the history of the book. He got a job working for E. Byrne Hackett in New York for whom he attended the Jerome Kern auction. In 1931 the depression found him unemployed and he took up independent book scouting to support himself. He had doubts about the decision, his wife was pregnant and "the only thing to do, it seemed, was to return to the Pennsylvania coal mines." Mrs Randall, however, thought otherwise, saying that he was hard enough to live with as it was and he would be "completely intolerable" if he wasn't doing a job he liked. He formed a relationship with Max Harzof through whom Randall met important figures in the book world. Randall also prepared catalogs based on Harzof's stock.

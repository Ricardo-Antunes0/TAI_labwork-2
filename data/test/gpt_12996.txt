The Sinking Creek Raid took place in December 1862, during the American Civil War. A Confederate force of 1,200 men under General John Bell Hood unsuccessfully attempted to raid Union supply trains on the Sinking Creek Railroad in Tennessee.  The raid was a significant failure for Hood and the Confederate army, as it resulted in a large number of casualties and little gain. The Union forces were able to repel the attack and maintain their supply lines. The raid has been cited as an example of strategic incompetence on Hood's part.

Mitochondrial ROS (mtROS or mROS) are reactive oxygen species (ROS) that originate from the mitochondria. Mitochondrial ROS are generated through the electron transport chain, and can damage cellular proteins, lipids, and DNA.  Mitochondrial ROS play an important role in cellular physiology, and have been implicated in a number of diseases including heart disease, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and diabetes.Mitochondrial ROS are also thought to contribute to aging.

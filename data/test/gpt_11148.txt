Pornography in Japan has unique characteristics that set it apart from pornography in other countries. Generally, pornography in Japan is not as explicit as pornography in other countries, and is often considered a form of entertainment rather than a form of sexual exploitation.  Pornography in Japan has a long history dating back to the Meiji period (1868-1912). At that time, pornographic books and magazines were widely available, and many Japanese men and women became familiar with pornographic representations through these materials.  During World War II (1939-1945), the Japanese government enacted laws regulating pornography, and these laws were used to target individuals associated with the production and distribution of pornography. This led to the imprisonment of many individuals who were accused of engaging in pornographic activities.  After World War II, the Japanese pornography industry gradually began to decline due to competition from Western pornography. However, the Japanese pornography industry experienced a resurgence in the late 1980s and 1990s due to the increasing popularity of Internet pornography. In recent years, there has been a decline in the number of pornographic movies being released in Japan, but this may be due to stricter regulation of pornographic content by government agencies.

Triton X-100 (n) is a nonionic surfactant developed by Rohm and Haas in the early 1970s as a replacement for SDS. It is a clear, colorless liquid with a slightly sweet odor. The molecule is linear, with a short hydrocarbon tail.   Triton X-100 is known for its ability to disperse oil and grease in water, as well as being effective in removing dirt and stains from surfaces. It is also commonly used in industrial cleaning applications and as a degreaser.

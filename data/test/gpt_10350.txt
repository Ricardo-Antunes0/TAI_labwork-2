Paddle dolls are a type of ancient Japanese dolls made from wood, with a cloth or paper skirt and a wooden head with a hole for the neck. They are often decorated with a simple design, often including a boat or paddle.   Paddle dolls are thought to have originated in the Kansai region of Japan in the Muromachi period (1336-1573). They are said to have been used to teach children how to use a paddle, and are also thought to have been used as dolls to promote family unity.   Today, paddle dolls are popular collectors' items, and can be found in many different styles and sizes. They are often used in traditional Japanese doll making, and can also be found in overseas markets.

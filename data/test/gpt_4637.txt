Bride price, bridewealth, or bride token, is a custom in many cultures around the world, primarily in societies that practice traditional marriage. The custom derives from the belief that a bride's family must pay a fee to the groom's family in order to secure the marriage.  The practice can be found in many parts of the world, including Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The custom varies from culture to culture, and may or may not involve payment of cash or goods. In some cases, the bride's family may simply provide hospitality to the groom's family during the wedding festivities.  Bride price is often seen as an important part of traditional marriage customs and is seen as a way to ensure that the marriage will be successful. It is also seen as a way to secure the financial resources of the bride's family so that they can support the bride during her married life.

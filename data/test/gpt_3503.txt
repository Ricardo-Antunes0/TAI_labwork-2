Jacqueline Picasso or Jacqueline Roque (24 February 1881 – 11 December 1962) was a French painter, sculptor, printmaker and ceramist.  Jacqueline Roque was born in 1881 in Paris, the daughter of the sculptor Auguste Roque and his wife Sophie-Rose. She began her training as a painter at the Académie Julian in 1907 with Jules Lefebvre, but soon switched to sculpture. Her early works were influenced by Auguste Rodin and Henri Matisse, but she eventually developed her own unique style.  Roque was a member of the Cercle Artistique de Paris and the Salon d'Automne. In 1935, she was awarded the Grand Prix national de la sculpture. Jacqueline Roque died in 1962.

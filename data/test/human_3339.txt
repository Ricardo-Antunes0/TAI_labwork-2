KVTX-LD, virtual channel 45 (UHF digital channel 15), is a low-powered Telemundo-affiliated television station licensed to Victoria, Texas, United States. Owned by Morgan Murphy Media, it is sister to ABC affiliate KAVU-TV (channel 25) and four other low-power stations: NBC affiliate KMOL-LD (channel 17), CBS affiliate KXTS-LD (channel 41), MeTV affiliate KQZY-LD (channel 33), and Univision affiliate KUNU-LD (channel 21). Morgan Murphy Media also operates Fox affiliate KVCT (channel 19) under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with owner SagamoreHill Broadcasting. All of the stations share studios on North Navarro Street in Victoria and transmitter facilities on Farm to Market Road 236 west of the city. Even though KVTX-LD has a digital signal of its own, the low-power broadcasting radius only covers the immediate Victoria area. Therefore, the station can also be seen through a 16:9 widescreen standard definition simulcast on KVCT's second digital subchannel in order to reach the entire market; this signal can be seen on VHF channel 11.2 (or virtual channel 19.2 via PSIP) from the same Farm to Market Road 236 transmitter site west of Victoria.

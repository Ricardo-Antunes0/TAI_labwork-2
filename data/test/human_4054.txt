Edith Graef McGeer,  (born November 18, 1923) is an American-Canadian neuroscientist, best known for her work and contributions to the research of prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Edith McGeer, along with her husband and co-collaborator, Patrick McGeer, were recognized by the International Scientific Institute as one of the 100 most highly cited researchers in neuroscience.   She's a co-founder of Aurin Biotech, which is advancing the drug AUR1107  in pre-clinical trials and FDA approval as an anti-inflammatory treatment for Alzheimer's, muscular degenerative conditions and some cancers. Education McGeer, who says her interest in mathematics began when she was five, skipped grades at the St. Agatha's School for Girls. At 16 years old, she declared a chemistry major at Swarthmore College and was not met with encouragement from the head of the chemistry department, since science wasn't considered a fitting profession for a woman in 1940. Graduating Phi Beta Kappa, McGeer completed her doctorate in organic chemistry from the University of Virginia in two years.

Modesto Christian School is a private Christian school in Salida, California, on the outskirts of Modesto. It was formerly affiliated with the Assemblies of God; it was founded in 1962 by Pastor Roy Blakeley, who had previously founded Neighborhood Church. It was a charter member of the Association of Christian Schools International. The school educates children from preschool through 12th grade and is divided into an elementary, a middle, and a high school, which are housed on the same campus. It is a small school; combined enrollment was 285 in 2009 and 343 in 2013â€“14. The first graduating class, in 1976, consisted of 8 students; in 2007 there were 86. In 2016, a group headed by Glen Villanueva, a local physician, purchased Modesto Christian School and part of the campus from Neighborhood Church. The school is now under the ownership of Modesto Christian School Incorporated, and is now non-denominational. A charter school, Great Valley Academy, bought the remainder of the campus.

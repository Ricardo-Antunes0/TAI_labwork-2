Wolfgang Liebe (22 June 1911 in Bad Gandersheim, Germany – 21 October 2005 in Berlin, Germany) was a German aerospace engineer and pioneer in aerodynamics, specialising in research to avoid stall in airfoils. He introduced the concept of wing fences. They obstruct span-wise airflow along the wing, and are widely used specifically in early swept-wing designs. Raised in Cottbus, Germany, Liebe attended the University of Danzig, receiving his degree in aircraft engineering in 1936. Very early on he had decided to become an aircraft engineer, having been an intern at the Junkers aircraft factory in Dessau. After university he joined the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt (DVL, German Research Institute for Aviation) and concentrated on the problem of preventing stall.  DVL was one of the foremost aircraft research facilities in Germany at the time.  To this end he tried out various devices to increase safety on a Me 109. These trials led to a patent being granted in 1938: “Device to avoid the spread of  flow disturbances”.

Andrea Somers is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Madeleine West. West had previously played the role of Dee Bliss, who disappeared after a car crash into the ocean after marrying Toadie Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney). West originally reported that she was returning to Neighbours as Dee Bliss, but it was later revealed she was playing the conniving Andrea Somers, who comes to Erinsborough to scam Toadie by pretending to be Dee. West stated that returning to the sets was a homecoming for her and she was thrilled to be invited back to the cast. Andrea made her first appearance on 20 January 2017 and her first stint ended on 23 March. Andrea is initially credited as Dee Bliss and is depicted as calm, polite and charismatic. As her identity of Andrea Somers is revealed, her character increasingly becomes impatient, insecure, restless and easily agitated. West returned to filming for a short stint at the end of 2017 and again in mid 2018. For these scenes, she was not credited as either Andrea Somers or Dee Bliss, but as a special appearance, leading viewers to question whether it was really Dee. Andrea returns when Toadie discovers that he is the father of Andrea's son, Hugo (John Turner). Producers later introduced Andrea's mother, Heather Schilling (Kerry Armstrong), who was acting as a nanny for Toadie's children and in an attempt to unite Toadie and Andrea. Whilst in rehabilitation in 2019, Andrea gives full custody of Hugo to Toadie and tells Toadie's wife that a man approached her and called her Karen, suggesting that Dee is still alive.

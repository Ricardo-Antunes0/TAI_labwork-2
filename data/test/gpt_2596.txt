Evolutionary anthropology, the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human and primate behavior, is one of the most rapidly growing and diverse areas of anthropology. Drawing on a range of methods, from quantitative genetics to archaeological analysis, evolutionary anthropologists seek to understand the origins and evolution of human behavior, culture, and cognition.  The discipline has grown rapidly in recent decades, as researchers have come to appreciate that evolutionary theory provides a powerful tool for understanding a wide range of human phenomena. This appreciation has led to the development of new methods and approaches in evolutionary anthropology, as well as to the incorporation of evolutionary theory into existing anthropological theories and models.  Evolutionary anthropology is currently divided into two main branches: social and cultural evolution, which focuses on the origins and evolution of human social institutions and behaviors, and biological evolution, which examines the origins and evolution of human biology. Other subfields within evolutionary anthropology include evolutionary psychology, evolutionary psychiatry, evolutionary linguistics, evolutionary neurobiology, and behavioral ecology.

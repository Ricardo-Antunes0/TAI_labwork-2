Hair bleaching, is the practice of lightening the color of hair by using either chemicals or light. It is most commonly used to remove unwanted hair, but it can also be used to change the color of hair.  The use of bleaching agents in hair removal has been around for centuries. Historically, bleaching was used to lighten the color of dark hair so that it would match the lighter hair of those with lighter skin. The use of bleaching products today is more likely to be used to remove unwanted hair.  There are a few different types of bleaching products available on the market. These products can be used at home or in a salon. Some products contain hydrogen peroxide, while others use ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light is the most effective type of bleaching for removing hair, but it is also the most damaging.  Bleaching can be done on its own or as part of a hair removal treatment. Most people choose to bleach their own hair, but it can also be done in a salon. There are several different types of bleaching treatments available, including laser, radiofrequency, and IPL (intensity-pulsed light).

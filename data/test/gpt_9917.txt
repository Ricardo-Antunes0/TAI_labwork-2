The Branimir inscription  is the oldest known inscription from the territory of Croatia. It was found in 1875 on a stone slab near the Branimir monastery in the town of Kastav, near Zagreb. The inscription is dated to the year 527 and records the donation of a vineyard by a man named Branimir to the monastery.  The inscription is notable for its archaic form of Croatian, its use of the Latin alphabet, and its evident dedication to the Christian faith. It is also significant for its reference to the Kingdom of Croatia, which had not yet been established at this point in history.

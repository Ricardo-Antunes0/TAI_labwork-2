In Christian theology, the Harrowing of Hell is the final and most severe punishment that will be inflicted on the wicked after they have died. According to the belief, when a person dies, their soul is immediately sent to Hell, and their body is left to decompose in the ground. The wicked are then visited by an angel who leads them through a series of six harrowing experiences, including being burned alive, being dragged through hot coals, and being forced to swim in pools of boiling water. Once they have completed these trials, the angel supposedly leads them into Hell itself, where they are tormented for eternity by demons.

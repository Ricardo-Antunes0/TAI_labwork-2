The Cummins Aeos is a concept electric-powered tractor developed and manufactured by Cummins Inc. The tractor is designed to provide farmers and ranchers with a reliable and fuel-efficient alternative to traditional diesel-powered tractors.  The Cummins Aeos was unveiled in late 2016 as a possible replacement for traditional diesel-powered tractors. The Aeos is powered by an electric motor, providing increased fuel efficiency and reduced emissions. The tractor also features an advanced onboard computer system that allows users to remotely control various functions of the tractor, including the engine, transmission, and steering.  The Cummins Aeos is currently in development by Cummins Inc., and the company plans to begin production of the tractor in 2020.

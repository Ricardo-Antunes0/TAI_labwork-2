The C class as designated in 1913 was a class of destroyers built for the Royal Navy in the early 20th century. The class was a major advance over the previous destroyer design, the A class. The C class was significantly larger than the A class and was armed with more powerful guns and more torpedoes.  The C class played a significant role in World War I, serving in both the Home Fleet and Mediterranean fleets. They also saw service in World War II, fighting in the Battle of the Norwegian Sea and the Battle of Dunkirk. After the war, many of the C class were sold to other countries and replaced by newer designs.

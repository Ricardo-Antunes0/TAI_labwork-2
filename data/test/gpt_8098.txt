Jonah or Jonas, son of Amittai, is the subject of the Old Testament Book of Jonah.  Jonah is a prophet of the Hebrew Bible, and the story of his journey and repentance is recounted in the Book of Jonah. Jonah is mentioned in the Torah (the first five books of the Jewish Bible), and is also mentioned in the New Testament book of Revelation.  Jonah's story takes place in the second half of the 10th century BC, during the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah. After being informed by Yahweh that he would be destroyed for his disobedience, Jonah fled to Tarshish to escape Yahweh's wrath. But Yahweh caused a storm to arise in the Mediterranean Sea so great that the ship carrying Jonah and his crew was swallowed by it. For three days and three nights Jonah was inside the fish, until he came up on shore in Nineveh. There he preached to the people and Yahuwah spared their city from destruction.  The Hebrew Bible contains four other prophets with similar names: Jonah is unique among these prophets in that he does not appear to have prophesied about Israel or Judah, but about a foreign country, Tarshish. Some scholars have suggested that these other prophets may have been based on Jonah, with different details added to make them more distinctive.

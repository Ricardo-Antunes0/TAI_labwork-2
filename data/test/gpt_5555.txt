The Victoria Social Association (HKVSA) was a social club that operated in Hong Kong from the late 1930s to the early 1990s. It was one of the few social clubs in Hong Kong that was open to both men and women, and its members included a wide range of socialites and businessmen.  The Victoria Social Association was founded in 1937 by a group of expatriates living in Hong Kong, and its first headquarters were located at the then-new Peak Tower. The club soon became popular among the city's wealthy residents, and its membership roster included such notable figures as Sir Robert Blackwood, Sheikh Mohammed al-Fayed, and Lady Doris Hart.  In the early 1990s, faced with increasing competition from other social clubs in Hong Kong, the Victoria Social Association closed its doors. Its legacy, however, remains alive today as one of the city's most prestigious social institutions.

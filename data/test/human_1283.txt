The Bougainville monkey-faced bat or Bougainville flying monkey (Pteralopex anceps) is a megabat endemic to Bougainville Island of Papua New Guinea and Choiseul Island of the Solomon Islands in Melanesia. It inhabits mature forests in upland areas, within the Autonomous Region of Bougainville and Bougouriba Province. Discovery and taxonomy It was first collected by English naturalist Albert Stewart Meek in April 1904 from Bougainville Island. That specimen was later used by Danish zoologist Knud Andersen in 1909 to describe a new species. The species name anceps comes from Latin, meaning "double-headed" or "having two heads." This could possibly be a reference to it being the second described member of Pteralopex, or that it had characters similar to both Pteralopex and Pteropus, especially the Bonin flying fox. In 1954, it was listed as a subspecies of the Guadalcanal monkey-faced bat. In 1978, it was once again listed a separate species. Some have considered it synonymous with the greater monkey-faced bat, which is found in the same range, while others maintain them as separate species.

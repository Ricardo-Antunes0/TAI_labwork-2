Michael Curtiz (1886–1962) was a Hungarian-born American film director whose career spanned from 1912 to 1961.  During this period he directed, wholly or in part, 181 films.  He began his cinematic career in Hungary, then moved to Austria and finally the United States.  As his biographer Alan K. Rode notes, "A cinematic pioneer, Curtiz made a seamless transition from hand-cranking cameras in silent films to directing the first sound feature where the characters spoke their parts. He led the way in two- and three-color Technicolor, directed the first motion-picture produced in VistaVision, and worked extensively in CinemaScope." Rode also notes that "he helmed rousing adventures, westerns, musicals, war movies, romances, historical dramas, horror films, tearjerkers, melodramas, comedies, spectacles, and film noirs." Born in Budapest, Curtiz graduated from Hungary's Royal Academy of Theatre and Art in 1906. After six years as a stage actor and director he joined the nascent Hungarian film industry. His first film credit was the 1912 drama, Maés Holnap ("Today and Tomorrow"). In 1913, after directing several films, Curtiz traveled to Denmark to hone his skills as an apprentice for director August Blom.  Returning to Hungary, he became a freelance director for several film companies. In 1919, Curtiz immigrated to Vienna and became one of Austria's top film directors.  His first film there was Die Dame Mit Dem Schwarzen Handschuh ("The Lady with the Black Gloves", 1919), starring his wife, Lucy Doraine. Among his subsequent Austrian films were the two-part epic Sodom and Gomorrah (1922) and Die Sklavenkönigin ("The Slave Queen", 1924).  The latter film was released in the United Kingdom as The Moon of Israel. Harry Warner, one of the founders of Warner Bros., instructed his brother Jack to view the film. After doing so, they were impressed enough to offer Curtiz a contract to direct in the United States.

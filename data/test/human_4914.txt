Other singles on JMI Records were "I Ain't In A Long, Long Time", and "Clean Your Own Tables".After JMI Records closed, the band went on to sign with RCA Records and began touring with Willie Nelson, Bobby Bare, Freddy Fender, Gary Stewart and numerous others. Still today they are often referred to as the first country band to sign to a major label. Some of their songs were written by Dave Gillon who also wrote hits for other artists such as Roy Clark, and Kenny Rogers. Watson, a keyboardist and guitarist, later became a backing musician for Don Williams.

The Ollis-class ferries are a trio of passenger ferries on the Staten Island Ferry, the first of which entered service in 2022. The class is named after US Army Staff Sergeant Michael Ollis, a Staten Islander who was killed in action during the War in Afghanistan in 2013. History Early work on the class began in August 2014, after a study into the future of Staten Island Ferry's fleet showed that the most economical course would be new-build ships instead of rebuilding existing vessels. The Elliott Bay Design Group was awarded a contract to design the new ships, which will replace  and , resulting in one additional ship in the Staten Island Ferry fleet.  The following month, substantial funding for the project, covering the construction of two ships, was secured with a $191.6 million federal grant from the Hurricane Sandy relief bill. As part of the new order, city officials allowed passengers to vote on the types of seats that would be installed in the new fleet.

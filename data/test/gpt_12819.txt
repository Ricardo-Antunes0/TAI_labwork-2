Emit Ecaps is the third album by the American experimental rock band Shellac, released on June 22, 2001 through Touch and Go Records. It was their first album released on a major label, and their first album to be produced by Steve Albini.  Emit Ecaps has been noted for its more abrasive sound and its darker lyrical content, which was in part inspired by frontman David Fricke's broken relationship with singer-songwriter Karen O. The album was also the first to feature drummer Justin Broadrick.  The album received mixed reviews from music critics, who praised its sonic experimentation but criticized its lack of songwriting cohesion. However, it has since been praised by many fans as one of Shellac's finest albums.

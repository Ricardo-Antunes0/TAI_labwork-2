San Fernando Hill (officially known as Naparima Hill) is a hill in the northwestern suburbs of Wellington, New Zealand. The hill is located in the Wellington Region, about 2.5 kilometres northeast of the city centre, and rises to a height of 293 metres above sea level.  The hill was once home to a small rural community, and was known for its abundant fruit orchards and dairy farms. It was also the location of a number of small quarries and mines, which were used to extract various types of stone and minerals. The hill has been largely rural in character since the early 20th century, and its population has declined over the years due to urbanisation and suburbanisation. Today, San Fernando Hill is primarily residential, with a small number of businesses and schools located on its slopes.

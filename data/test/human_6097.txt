in•ter a•li•a is the fourth studio album by At the Drive-In, released on May 5, 2017. It is their first studio album in 17 years since Relationship of Command, and their first release since the 2005 compilation album This Station Is Non-Operational. It is also the first studio release by the band since El Gran Orgo to not feature founding member Jim Ward, who chose not to participate in the band's second reunion; as well as the first studio album by the band to feature former Sparta guitarist Keeley Davis. Background in•ter a•li•a was recorded during the second half of 2016 following a proper reunion tour beginning in March of that year. Drummer Tony Hajjar said of recording the album: "It was the most fun I’ve had in years. It was so great to be around people I care for and care for me. We had some awesome, tough moments. But at the end, they were still great. When it was done we went into the studio control room, the last day of recording, we all just hugged each other. I’m so proud of my brothers, proud that we’ve done this, proud that we still get to do this at any level."

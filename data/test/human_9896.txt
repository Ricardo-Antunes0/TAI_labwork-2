Darova (;  or Kranichstätten) is a commune in Timiș County, Romania. It is composed of three villages: Darova, Hodoș  and Sacoșu Mare (until 1921 Sacoșu Unguresc; ;  or Großsakosch). Ștefănești  existed as a separate hamlet from 1885 to 1930, when it was merged into Darova, with Darova Nouă  similarly absorbed in 1956. History  Darova was founded in 1786 by 57 families of German settlers from Silesia and Württemberg. It happened during the third wave of colonizations in Banat, under the reign of Emperor Joseph II. The name was given in honor of the government commissioner of Temes County, Count Johann Jankovits von Daruwar. Only two years after its founding, in the autumn of 1788, Darova was invaded by the Turks. Most of the younger settlers fled Darova and only a few returned after the Turks were driven out. In 1791, some of the German inhabitants of the village of Tormac settled in Darova.

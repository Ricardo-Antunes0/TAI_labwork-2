Operation Swarmer was a joint U.S-Iraqi air campaign conducted in the spring of 2003 against the Iraqi insurgency. The campaign was named after the Iraqi insurgent tactic of planting IEDs in busy areas, which became known as "swarmer bombs".  The objectives of Operation Swarmer were to break the back of the insurgency by destroying its command and control infrastructure, and to prevent the insurgents from mounting fresh attacks. The campaign was successful, and by the end of 2003 the insurgency had been largely defeated.

The Lord Steward or Lord Steward of the Household was a senior official in the royal household of England and later the United Kingdom.  The office of Lord Steward was created in the 12th century, and survived through to the 19th century. The last holder of the post was William Cubitt, who held it from 1837 to 1848.  The Lord Steward had overall charge of the household, which consisted of the King's personal staff and officers. The Lord Steward also administered the Household Income and expenditure and supervised the King's charities.   The office of Lord Steward was abolished in 1830, with its functions transferred to other government departments.

The Teatro Puerto Rico was a music hall located in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It was one of the most famous and historically significant music halls in the island.  The Teatro Puerto Rico was founded in 1885 by then-mayor of San Juan, Teodoro Moscoso. The hall was located on Calle de los Negros (now Avenida de la Constitución), between Calles Obispo and Lares. It was the first theater in San Juan to offer electric light and sound.  The theater was originally built with a capacity of 1,500 spectators. However, it soon became one of the most popular music halls in the island, hosting performances by some of the greatest performers of the time, such as Anselmo Casanova, Manuel Ponce and Rafael Hernández. In 1924, the theater was renovated and enlarged to its present size of 2,000 seats.  The Teatro Puerto Rico ceased operations in 1977. The building was later used as a parking lot and then abandoned. In 2006, the building was damaged by a fire that destroyed part of its facade. The theater was eventually demolished in 2013 to make way for a new commercial development.

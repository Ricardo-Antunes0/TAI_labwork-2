Bhumibol Adulyadej (; ; ; 5 December 1927 â€“ 13 October 2016), also known as King Bhumibol of Thailand, was the tenth and longest-reigning monarch of Thailand. He reigned for more than 70 years, making him the world's longest-serving head of state in history.  Bhumibol was a key figure in Thai politics for most of his life, serving as regent for his son from 1946 to 1972 and then as the prime minister from 1972 to 1987. He became king in 1950 after his father, King Chulalongkorn, died. Bhumibol undertook numerous royal duties, including patronage of arts and culture, and was a major patron of Buddhism. In 2004 he was awarded the title "Dhammakaya Thera" by the Buddhist World Fellowship. He died in 2016 at the age of 88 after a long illness and was succeeded by his son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn.  Bhumibol is well known outside Thailand for his philanthropy, which has helped build schools and hospitals throughout the country. He has been honoured with various titles and distinctions around the world, including being made a UN Messenger of Peace in 2006 and being granted honorary citizenship by multiple countries. The annual King's Birthday celebrations in Thailand are now one of the country's most important national holidays.

Polydolopimorphia is an extinct order of metatherians, more closely related to extant marsupials than other extinct mammals. Known from the Paleocene-Pliocene of South America and the Eocene of Antarctica, they were a diverse group during the Paleogene, filling many niches, before declining and becoming extinct at the end of the Neogene. It is divided into two suborders, Bonapartheriiformes, and Polydolopiformes  The morphology of the teeth suggests that polydolopimorphians may be crown group marsupials, nested within Australidelphia. The group contained omnivorous, frugivorous and herbivorous forms.

Catherine Anne Fraser (born August 4, 1947) is a Canadian lawyer and judge who has served as the Chief Justice of Alberta since 1992. As Chief Justice of Alberta, Fraser also serves as chief justice of the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories (since 1992) and the Nunavut Court of Appeal (since its creation in 1999). Early years Fraser was born in Campbellton, New Brunswick and moved to Edmonton in 1958. Her mother worked as a teacher and her grandparents were immigrants from Lebanon and Ukraine. One of her first jobs was working in the women's section of a department store; she was paid $35 a week, five dollars less than her male colleague who worked in the men's section. Fraser stated in a 2014 interview with the Edmonton Journal that "it brought home to [her] the differences in how men and women were being treated during that era in our society." She also stated that she chose the law as a profession because she saw it as a "vehicle for change" and because she was "concerned about inequality in society."

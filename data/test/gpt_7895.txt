The first Constitution of Morocco was adopted on September 27, 1962. The Constitution replaced the French Constitution of 1958, and its main objectives were to form a strong and centralized government, guarantee human rights and freedoms, and promote social justice.  Morocco's current Constitution was drafted in November 1992 after years of political instability. The Constitution was amended in December 1999, November 2007, and December 2012. It guarantees fundamental rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of religion. The Constitution also establishes a multi-party system and a separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Morocco is a presidential republic with a bicameral legislature.

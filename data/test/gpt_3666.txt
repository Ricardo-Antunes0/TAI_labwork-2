In popular culture, the friend zone (or friend zone phenomenon) is a social phenomenon in which a person who is attracted to another person, but who is not considered to be romantically interested in that person, is often ignored or rejected. The term can be used as an insult, implying that the person in question is not a true friend.  The friend zone has been identified as a problem in relationships by both men and women. For men, it often leads to feelings of loneliness and inferiority. For women, it can lead to feelings of frustration and anger. The friend zone can also have negative effects on the friendships of those involved.  The term "friend zone" was first used in an article by Greg Behrendt titled "Why Women Keep Getting In The Friend Zone" which was published in November 1996 in the magazine Men's Journal. Behrendt argued that the friend zone was a problem because it prevented men from developing genuine relationships with women.  The term "friend zone" was first used online in a blog post by Jesse Singal titled "Why I Left The Friend Zone" which was published on the website Gawker on April 5, 2009. Singal argued that the friend zone was a problem because it prevented men from developing genuine relationships with women.

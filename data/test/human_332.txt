The discography of the British girl group Sugababes consists of seven studio albums, four compilation album, three extended plays, thirty one singles (two as featured artists), two video albums and eight promotional singles. The Sugababes were formed in 1998 and, at various times, featured three vocalists from Heidi Range, Amelle Berrabah, Jade Ewen, Siobh√°n Donaghy, Mutya Buena and Keisha Buchanan. The Sugababes' debut album, One Touch, was released in November 2000 and peaked at number twenty-six on the UK chart, eventually earning gold certification. One Touch produced four singles, three of which reached the top twenty, while the album's lead single "Overload" was nominated for a BRIT Award for Best British Single. The album's sales did not meet the expectations of London Records and the group was subsequently dropped. Donaghy left the group in August 2001 and was replaced by former Atomic Kitten member Heidi Range. The group's second album Angels with Dirty Faces was released in August 2002 through Island Records. Influenced by the new wave, dance, and pop music of the 1980s, the record enjoyed success in the UK where it reached number two and went triple platinum. It produced the number one singles "Freak Like Me" and "Round Round", and nominated for Best British Album at the 2003 BRIT Awards.

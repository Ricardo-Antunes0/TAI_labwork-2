Daniel Ken Inouye ( ;, September 7, 1918 – December 17, 2012) was an American politician who was the 23rd United States Senator from Hawaii, serving from 1959 to 1987. A Democrat, Inouye was the first Japanese American elected to the United States Congress, and he served as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee during the Reagan Administration. He also served as president pro tempore of the United States Senate during the 101st and 102nd Congresses. Inouye also served as a military officer in World War II and the Korean War.  Inouye was born in Waimānalo, on Oahu, to Japanese immigrant parents. He attended public schools and then became a busboy at a hotel in Honolulu before enlisting in the United States Army in 1942 at the age of 18. He served in the Signal Corps in Europe and then in the Pacific Theater of Operations, eventually becoming a captain. After his discharge from the Army, Inouye enrolled at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah, where he majored in political science and minored in law.  In 1944, while a student at BYU, Inouye ran for Congress as a Democrat against incumbent Republican Charles Curtis. Curtis won by more than 20,000 votes but Inouye's campaign made him a national figure. He was elected to two terms in Congress (1948–1952), where he chaired the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and was a strong opponent of McCarthyism.  In

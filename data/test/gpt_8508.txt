The history of Ontario covers the period from the arrival of the first Europeans in the region to the present day.  The area now known as Ontario was first explored by Europeans in the early 16th century. French explorer Jacques Cartier claimed the region for France in 1535, and it became a part of New France. After the fall of New France in 1763, the region was divided between Great Britain and Spain. The portion that became Ontario was part of the British province of Quebec until 1841, when it was added to the newly created Province of Canada. The boundary between Ontario and Quebec has since been moved several times, most recently to its current location in 1998.  Ontario's economy is heavily dependent on its natural resources, especially its valuable agricultural land and heavy manufacturing industries. The province has a number of large cities, including Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, and Hamilton. Ontario is also home to a number of smaller cities and towns.

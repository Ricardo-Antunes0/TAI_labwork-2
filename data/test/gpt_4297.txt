Chemical similarity (or molecular similarity) refers to the degree to which two molecules exhibit similarities in their chemical structure. This can be determined through a number of spectroscopic methods, including infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry. The degree of similarity between molecules can be used to determine their chemical class, as well as to identify potential drug targets and chemicals that might interact with one another.  Molecules that are chemically similar tend to have similar physical and chemical properties. For example, molecules that are related to the sugar molecule glucose are likely to share many of the same physical and chemical properties. This is due in part to the way that atoms are bonded together in molecules â€“ similar atoms will share more bonds than dissimilar atoms. This means that molecules that are related will also share many of the same chemical properties.  The degree of similarity between molecules can be measured using a number of spectroscopic methods, including infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry. Each method has its own advantages and limitations, but all of them allow scientists to identify the chemical structure of molecules. This information can then be used to determine the chemical class of the molecule, as well as to identify potential drug targets and chemicals that might interact with one another.

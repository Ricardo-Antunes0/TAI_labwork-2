The Early Middle Ages or Early Medieval Period was a time period that spanned the 6th to 13th centuries in Europe. The Early Middle Ages followed the late Roman Empire and preceded the High Middle Ages.  The Early Middle Ages largely overlap with the late Roman Empire and are considered part of the same period in European history. There is no universally accepted definition of the Early Middle Ages, but it is generally seen as comprising the 6th to 10th centuries.  The term "Early Middle Ages" was introduced in the 19th century and has been used by various historians since then to cover a wide range of time periods. The following timeline is based on the traditional view of Western history, which sees the Roman Empire ending in 476 AD and the Early Middle Ages commencing with the fall of Rome.   The Early Middle Ages were a time of great transformation for Europe, as the political structure of the Roman Empire broke down and was replaced by numerous small independent states. This led to a period of strong regional identities and many changes in culture, including an increased interest in literature and learning.

Iniopterygiformes ("Nape Wing Forms") is an extinct family of predatory birds that lived during the Late Cretaceous. They were a basal group in the avian order Iniopterygiformes, which is now considered to be a paraphyletic group containing only the ratite families. The Iniopterygiformes are distinguished from other avian groups by their extremely elongated, nape-like wings, which gave them an aerial agility and soaring capability that was unique among early ornithischians.

The Iniopterygiformes were distinguished from other avian groups by their extremely elongated, nape-like wings, which gave them an aerial agility and soaring capability that was unique among early ornithischians. They are known from a limited number of fossil specimens dating from the Late Cretaceous (about 75-72 million years ago) found in North America and Europe. The family contains only one genus and one species, Iniopteryx brevicornis.

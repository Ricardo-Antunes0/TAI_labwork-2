Case White , also known as the Battle of the Bulge, was a military campaign fought by the Axis powers in World War II. It began on 16 December 1944, and ended on 11 January 1945. The battle involved more than 250,000 soldiers from both the Wehrmacht and the SS, as well as several thousand troops from the Italian Army, fighting against 600,000 Allied soldiers.  The offensive was planned by Adolf Hitler with the aim of relieving German troops in the Ardennes region of Belgium, and cutting off Allied forces from the ports of Antwerp and Calais. However, poor weather conditions led to delays in starting the offensive, and by December 1944 it was already too late in the year for it to be successful. By January 1945, Allied forces had surrounded the Axis armies in Belgium and Luxembourg, leading to their eventual surrender.

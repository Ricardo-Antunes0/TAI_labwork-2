Hans Borchsenius (September 19, 1832 – April 20, 1899) was a German mathematician who worked in the area of geometry. He is best known for his work in the theory of curves, in particular for his discovery of the Borchsenius transform.  Hans Borchsenius was born on September 19, 1832, in Königsberg, Prussia. He studied at the University of Königsberg where he received his doctorate in 1859. From 1861 to 1872 he was a professor at the University of Königsberg, and from 1872 to 1899 he was a professor at the University of Berlin.  Borchsenius was best known for his work in the theory of curves, in particular for his discovery of the Borchsenius transform. He also developed methods for solving problems in this area and made significant contributions to differential geometry. He died on April 20, 1899, in Berlin.

Territoriality is a term associated with nonverbal communication, which refers to the use of space and physical environment for communication. It has been defined as "the tendency of individuals or groups to establish and maintain boundaries within their environments".[1] Territoriality can be seen as an important component of individual and group identity, and can play a role in social interaction.  Territoriality has been observed in a wide range of animals, from primates to invertebrates. In humans, territoriality is particularly pronounced in infants and juveniles, who often display aggressive behaviors directed at other members of their own species or at members of other species that have encroached upon their territory. It is also common among animals that live in close proximity to others, such as chimpanzees and baboons.  Territoriality is often associated with aggression, but it can also play a role in communication and social interaction. For example, primates that live in groups often use territorial displays to communicate information about the location of food or water sources. Likewise, animals that live in close proximity to one another often use territorial displays to establish boundaries between themselves and other groups.

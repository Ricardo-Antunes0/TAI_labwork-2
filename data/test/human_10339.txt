Arriva Rail North, branded as Northern by Arriva (legal name Arriva Rail North Limited) was a train operating company in Northern England which began operating the Northern franchise on 1 April 2016 and inherited units from the previous operator Northern Rail. A subsidiary of Arriva UK Trains, Northern was the largest train franchise in the United Kingdom in terms of the size of the network and the number of weekly services run. Its trains called at 528 stations, about a quarter of all stations in the country; of these stations 476 were operated by Northern. On 1 March 2020, Arriva Rail North Limited ceased to operate and all operations were handed to HM Government's Operator of Last Resort. During the preceding Northern Rail franchise passenger numbers increased from 73million to 97million between 2004 and 2016 and as a result the new franchise was tendered on a growth basis, allowing for a Â£500million investment in 101 new-built trains: the diesel Class 195 and electric Class 331. Introduced into service in July 2019, these were the first new-build trains for the Northern franchise since the introduction of the Class 333 in 2000, with further orders possible if the new units encouraged passenger growth and improved passenger satisfaction. The new rolling stock would enable all Pacer trains to be retired by June 2020.

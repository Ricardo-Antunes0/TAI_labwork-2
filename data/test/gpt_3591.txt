Vladimir Vladimirovich Sakharov (28 February 1902 â€“ 14 December 1989) was a Soviet physicist, Nobel Prize laureate, and human rights activist. He was the first person to be arrested and executed in the Soviet Union for his political beliefs.  Born in the Russian town of Riga into a family of modest means, Sakharov became interested in science at an early age. After completing his secondary education in 1922, he studied at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, where he developed his expertise in quantum mechanics and nuclear physics. In 1939, he was arrested by the NKVD for being an "enemy of the people". During his imprisonment and subsequent exile to Siberia, Sakharov continued to work on scientific projects, but also developed a passionate interest in human rights. Upon his release from prison in 1957, he moved to Moscow and resumed his academic career.  Sakharov became one of the foremost researchers in the field of nuclear physics in the Soviet Union. He was also a vocal critic of the Soviet regime, which led to his arrest and execution in 1989. His death has been seen as a seminal moment in the downfall of the Soviet Union. Sakharov is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in 20th-century Russian history.

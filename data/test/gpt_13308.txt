Winston Kinnard Garland (born December 19, 1964) is an American mathematician and professor of mathematics at the University of Maryland, College Park. He has made significant contributions to the theory of operator algebras, and is known for his work on semigroups, Banach space theory, and mathematical physics.  Garland was born in Washington, D.C., on December 19, 1964. He received his B.S. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1986 and his Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1991. From 1991 to 1995 he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. From 1995 to 1997 he was an assistant professor at Princeton, and from 1997 to 2002 he was an associate professor at the University of Maryland. Since 2002 he has been a professor at Maryland.  Garland's research is in the theory of operator algebras, semigroups, Banach space theory, and mathematical physics. His work on operator algebras has led him to develop new methods for analyzing certain classes of operators that are important in physics and engineering. His work on semigroups has led him to develop new techniques for solving problems in Banach space theory that are important in problems in mathematical physics and engineering. His work on mathematical physics has led him to develop new methods for studying the behavior of particles and fields in complex physical systems.

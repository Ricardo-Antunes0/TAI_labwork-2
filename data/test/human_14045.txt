Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's call for non-co-operation movement, he walked out of an examination and started living on his own. He opened a shop in local market selling towels and he was also an editor of a local weekly named Shakti. Dhiren Ganguly, better known as DG, an established film director from Calcutta, was visiting Burdwan at that time. DG met Debaki and as he came know about Debaki's writing skill, he invited Debaki to come to Calcutta and to write film scripts for him. This culminated into the first film made by British Dominion Films named Kamonar Agun (or Flames of Flesh).

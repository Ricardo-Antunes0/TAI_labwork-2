The Wiikwemkoong First Nation is a First Nation on Manitoulin Island in Northern Ontario. The Wiikwemkoong Unceded Territory (nicknamed Wiky, previously named Wikwemikong) is the First Nation reserve in the north-eastern section of Manitoulin Island in Manitoulin District, Ontario, Canada. Wiikwemkoong is an unceded Indigenous reserve in Canada, which means that it has not "relinquished title to its land to the government by treaty or otherwise." The local Ojibwe placename is  (Manitoulin dialect; notice the vowel dropping) with the locative -ong ('at') form of  'bay with a gently sloping bottom'.  The spelling  is from dialects spoken elsewhere (or in earlier times) that retain the i. The initial element  occurs in other forms as 'bay'; the final element -mik cannot be for  'beaver' (its local form is mik), a folk etymology that violates the rules for Algonquian stem formation. It can be identified as a variant of the medial element  , which appears, for example, in Southwestern Ojibwe  'there are breakers, shoals, banks (of sand or rocks)', which has initial min- 'islandlike'. The presence or absence of aa- is found in several medial elements in Ojibwe and other Algonquian languages.

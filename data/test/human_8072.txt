Jay R. Traver (1894–1974) was a University of Massachusetts entomologist. Jeffrey Lockwood wrote in The Infested Mind: Why Humans Fear, Loathe, and Love Insects that she was responsible for "one of the most remarkable mistakes ever published in a scientific entomological journal". Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington  Traver displayed evidence in her writing of having what has been described as a classic case of delusional parasitosis – a mental disorder in which there is no evidence, yet individuals believe they have a parasitic infestation of the skin. After she was "rebuffed by doctors for years" when describing her symptoms, she embarked on a quest to identify the source of what she believed was an infestation causing her skin sores.  A dermatologist said her symptoms "were largely imaginary" or  "caused by an ill-advise (sic) attempt [at self-medication by the patient]". She convinced a neurologist that she did not need his help. She corresponded with others who reported similar symptoms, and used 22 different chemicals to attempt to rid herself of the infestation.

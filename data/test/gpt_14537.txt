Hillel Yaffe (1864â€“1936)  was a Russian-born American rabbi and the founder of the Conservative movement's Yeshiva University.  Hillel Yaffe was born in Vilna, Russian Empire in 1864. His family moved to Breslau, Germany when he was a child, and then to Manchester, England in 1875. He started his religious education at a Yeshiva in London, and then at the Mir Yeshiva in Pinsk, Belarus. In 1892 he emigrated to the United States, settling in New York City.  In 1893 he became the rabbi of Congregation B'nai Jeshurun on Manhattan's Lower East Side. He served in this position for fifteen years, during which time he helped to revitalize the congregation and build it into one of the city's largest and most influential Orthodox synagogues. In 1914 he left B'nai Jeshurun to found Yeshiva University, which would become one of the leading Conservative rabbinical seminaries in the world. He served as its first president until his death in 1936.  Yaffe was a prolific writer and lecturer, and his work has had a significant impact on Jewish theology and religious life throughout the world. He is especially well known for his book "Torah U-Madda" (1915), which synthesizes traditional Jewish theology with contemporary scientific thought.

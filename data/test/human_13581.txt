Le Col–Wahoo is a UCI women's cycling team based in the United Kingdom, founded in 2015. The team is jointly sponsored by cycling apparel firm Le Col and fitness technology company Wahoo. Sponsorship  Unlike many teams that are named purely after their sponsors the team have managed to maintain the 'Drops' brand throughout the majority of its existence whilst supplementing the Drops name with title sponsors. In 2018 Trek Bikes became title sponsors of the team. In 2019 the team reverted to its previous name as Trek ended their sponsorship after one year in order to start their own team. When a prospective replacement sponsor also pulled out the team launched a crowdfunding campaign in order to stay afloat  and raised £25,000.    In December 2020 it was announced that the team's clothing supplier Le Col would step up to co-title sponsor for the 2021 season after agreeing to double their investment in the team. They were joined by American mattress and pillow manufacturer TEMPUR. The team confirmed that funding would not go as far as being able to pay a salary to riders, something Drops has always been transparent about its inability to do.

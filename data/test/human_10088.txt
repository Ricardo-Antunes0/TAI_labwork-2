Belgrave St Ives is a commercial art gallery, specialising in modern British and contemporary art in St Ives, Cornwall, southwest England. It gives emphasis to work produced in Cornwall from the 1930s onwards, when the town of St Ives became an internationally important modernist artistic centre. History The original gallery opened in 1974 in Motcomb Street, Belgravia, London. It moved to various London locations, including Mayfair, St James's, and Belsize Park until a St Ives sister gallery opened in 1998. In 2010 the St Ives gallery became independent and continues as the sole remaining part of the Belgrave Gallery enterprise. It maintains a programme of exhibitions of work by major artists associated with the St Ives Modern Period, such as Wilhelmina Barns-Graham and Terry Frost, as well as representing those formerly overshadowed in conventional accounts of Modern British art recently gaining greater prominence such as Sven Berlin. Works by other Modern British and contemporary artists are also shown. An annual fixture is the St Ives Exhibition, usually in the early summer, which focuses on Modernist art produced by those associated with the town.

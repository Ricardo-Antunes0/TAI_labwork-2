The Representative of Gibraltar in Aldwych, London, is a building in the City of Westminster, London, which has been the seat of the Gibraltarian Government since 1903.   The current building, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and completed in 1933, replaced an earlier structure on the same site. The first Gibraltarian Representative's residence was a small wooden house on the site which was burnt down in 1814. The present Gibraltar House was built as a memorial to Sir John Moore, hero of the Napoleonic Wars. It is also known as Lutyens' Gibraltar because of its distinctive style.  The Gibraltarian Government has its own flag and coat of arms, which are displayed in the building. The main entrance is flanked by two monumental stone columns, each surmounted by a bronze statue of a lion rampant, the emblem of Gibraltar.

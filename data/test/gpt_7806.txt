Fence is an American comic book series created by Matt Fraction and David Aja. The series follows the adventures of an alcoholic, ex-mercenary, and failed artist named Alias. After a near-fatal car accident, Alias is left with a metal fence implanted in his head that allows him to connect with the internet and various other networks. Using this new found ability, Alias becomes a private detective, solving cases that would otherwise go unsolved.  Fence has been praised for its innovative visual style and dark humor. The first volume was nominated for an Eisner Award for Best New Series.

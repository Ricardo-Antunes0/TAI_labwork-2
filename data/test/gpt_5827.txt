Eucalyptus suffulgens is a small to medium-sized tree that is native to the south-west of Western Australia. The tree typically grows to a height of 10-15 m, and has a smooth, grey-brown bark. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, and are green on the uppersurface, and with a purplish-red lower surface. The flowers are white, and are produced in clusters at the tips of the branches. The fruit is a pod which contains two black seeds. Eucalyptus suffulgens is commonly found in coastal areas, and is used for timber, fuel, and medicinal purposes.

The Moscow Peace Treaty was signed by the Soviet Union and the United States on May 14, 1921, ending World War I. The treaty was ratified by the Russian SFSR on July 17, 1921, and by the US on July 18, 1921.  The treaty resulted in the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Central Europe and the Treaty of Trianon confirmed the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The treaty allowed for a demilitarized zone along the Polish–Soviet border and an eventual Polish–Soviet alliance that defeated Nazi Germany in 1945.

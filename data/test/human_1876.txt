The Palace of Tau   in Reims, France, was the palace of the Archbishop of Reims.  It is associated with the kings of France, whose coronation was held in the nearby cathedral of Notre-Dame de Reims and the following coronation banquet in the palace itself. Because of its historical importance for the French monarchy, the Palace of Tau was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1991. Today, it serves to host cultural events for the city of Reims. In recent years it has been the setting for Sciences Po Paris's RIMUN association's annual gala. History A large Gallo-Roman villa still occupied the site of the palace in the 6th and 7th centuries, and later became a Carolingian palace.  The first documented use of the name dates to 1131, and derives from the plan of the building, which resembles the letter Î¤ (tau, in the Greek alphabet).  Most of the early building has disappeared: the oldest part remaining is the chapel, from 1207.  The building was largely rebuilt in Gothic style between 1498 and 1509, and modified to its present Baroque appearance between 1671 and 1710 by Jules Hardouin-Mansart and Robert de Cotte.  It was damaged by a fire on 19 September 1914, and not repaired until after the Second World War.

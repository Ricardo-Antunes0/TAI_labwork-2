The Mainz-Hessian War of 1427 was the final military conflict in the two-century long dispute between the Archdiocese of Mainz and Landgrave of Hesse over supremacy of the Hesse region. The decisive victories of Landgrave Ludwig I over the Mainzian military leader Gottfried von Leiningen near Fritzlar and over Archbishop  near Fulda spelled the end of Mainz's ambitions in the Hesse region. The Peace of Frankfurt, signed on December 8, 1427, decisively ended both the war and the long-standing power struggle between Hesse and Mainz. Background Previous causes of dispute between Hesse and Mainz included control over the villages within the Reinhardswald, the Lippoldsberg and Helmarshausen monasteries, and the rights to the city of Wetter. From 1425 onward, mutual interference in the affairs of the Fulda Abbey and controversial deals with Count Henry VII and Wolrad I of Waldeck brought tensions to a breaking point. Attempts to defuse the situation by other princes were unsuccessful, and open war broke out between the two states in 1427.

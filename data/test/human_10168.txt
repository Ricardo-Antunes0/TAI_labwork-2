The Universalists were a Russian anarcho-communist organization established in 1920 to support the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. After a period of growth, the organization split and was eventually suppressed in the wake of the Kronstadt rebellion. History In August 1920, the brothers Abba Gordin and Wolf Gordin came together with German Askarov to found the tendency of "Anarcho-Universalism" within the Russian anarchist movement, as part of a broader trend of "Soviet anarchism", which supported the Bolsheviks. As part of their "different approach to the Soviet state", they sought to define a new course of action for the anarchist movement to take under a new socialist state, as the older anarchist methods had been defined by "a different environment, different circumstances and a different power structures". They argued that a centralized "dictatorship of the proletariat" was necessary for the transition to a stateless communist society and advocated for Russian anarchists to collaborate with the Bolsheviks, ceasing all hostile activity in opposition to the Soviet government. Their policy was noted by Paul Avrich as being similar to that of the Maximalists, a radical faction of the Socialist Revolutionaries which split off and later joined the Communist Party.

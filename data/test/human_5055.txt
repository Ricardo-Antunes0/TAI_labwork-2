Loxford is part of Ilford in the London Borough of Redbridge in  east London, UK. It is a built-up, multi-ethnic locality. History The medieval manor of Loxford was in the possession of Barking Abbey and in 1319 the Abbess of Barking was licensed to fell oaks in Hainault Forest to rebuild her house here after a fire. The present Loxford Hall dates from about 1830 and was enlarged around 1860. The terraced street plan of the Loxford Hall estate was laid out at the end of the nineteenth century as one of a cluster of developments that filled southern Ilford with relatively small and cheap houses. The first Loxford schools were opened in 1904. Loxford School is a new building replacing a secondary school. The Loxford Practice Loxford Polyclinic] - the first purpose-built - opened in 2009. It is the location of Loxford Water, a tributary of the River Roding that forms the northern boundary of Barking Park. Loxford Hall now serves as a child and family consultation centre for the North East London Foundation Trust. Loxford's main ethnic groups are white, Pakistani and Indian. Ilford Lane has heavy South Asian influences.

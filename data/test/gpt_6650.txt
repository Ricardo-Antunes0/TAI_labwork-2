Nonverbal autism is a subset of autism characterized by difficulties in communicating through nonverbal means. Individuals with this form of autism may have difficulties understanding and responding to social cues, which can make it difficult for them to form friendships and relationships.  There is currently no cure for nonverbal autism, but there are a number of treatments available that can help support the individual's social and communication abilities. Treatment options may include speech therapy, occupational therapy, and special needs education.  Nonverbal autism is a relatively new diagnosis, first being recognized in the early 1900s. There is still much we don't know about the condition, but researchers are continuing to study it in order to better understand and treat it.

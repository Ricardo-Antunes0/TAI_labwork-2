The Madagiz offensive, also called the Battle of Madagasikara, was a military campaign by the French Revolutionary Wars-era French Army against the Kingdom of Madagascar. The offensive took place in the late summer of 1795, and resulted in a French victory.  The French Revolutionary Wars-era French Army had been campaigning in the Indian Ocean since 1793, when they had captured Mah√© and then seized the southern part of the island of Madagascar. In 1794 they had landed on the north coast of Madagascar and begun to advance inland. The Kingdom of Madagascar, which was under the rule of a British ally, responded by forming an army to oppose the invaders.  The Madagiz offensive began on 21 July 1795, with an amphibious landing near Antananarivo. The French then began to march inland, meeting resistance from the Malagasy army at every turn. By 4 August they had reached Tamatave, where they established their main base of operations. On 11 August they launched a series of coordinated attacks against the towns around Antananarivo, which quickly fell into French hands.   The Kingdom of Madagascar capitulated on 20 August 1795, ending the Madagiz offensive. The outcome was a French victory, which allowed them to expand their territory in Madagascar and further into central Africa.

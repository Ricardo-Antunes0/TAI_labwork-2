No Sick Days is the 9th studio album by rapper Lil Wyte. It is the second album released by him in 2014. Background Lil Wyte first mentioned the album a few weeks after releasing No Filter with JellyRoll confirming the title "No Sick Days". Lil Wyte released a VLOG on his YouTube channel on the 6th of March, in which he explains details about the album. He said that he has been recording the album for 6 months unlike No Filter and B.A.R. (Bay Area Representatives) which were recorded in a few weeks. He had to take a few breaks though because of his involvement in his mixtape Wyte Christmas IV on which he confirmed the release date, his collaboration album with Frayser Boy and the upcoming "Witch" album by Gangsta Boo and La Chat. Also he mentions that this is the first album in a long time where he made music he liked. He confirmed the producers and the featuring artists on the album. On March 3 he also uploaded a picture of the current track list that had 13 tracks though only four songs were readable due to the picture being blurred with the length of the songs being 46 minutes. On March 12 he released a picture of the complete track list with guests, that has 16 tracks on it, adding that he may add 1 or 2 more songs to it. On March 25 the album became available for Pre-Order on wytestore.com revealing an altered track list, with songs from the earlier track list ("Squirter" ft Gangsta Boo, "Knockin Heads" and "Seance") being replaced by different ones ("It's 4:20" and "No Sick Days") and the song "Never Been" retitled to "I'm a Hoe", also adding JellyRoll as a guest on "Ride It Like a Rental". It's currently unknown if the replaced tracks will be released or not.

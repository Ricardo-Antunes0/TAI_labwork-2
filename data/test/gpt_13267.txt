Underwater habitats are underwater structures in which aquatic life resides or can reside. They can include coral reefs, mangroves, seagrasses, and other submerged plant and animal habitats.  Underwater habitats provide a unique environment for marine life and offer a platform for research and education. They are also important for tourism, recreation, and commercial fisheries. Underwater habitats are threatened by pollution, coastal development, climate change, and overfishing.

Kabillion is a children's video-on-demand service owned by Splash Entertainment. Launched on January 7, 2007, Kabillion is available both as a free VOD channel currently available on Comcast, Spectrum, Charter Communications, Altice USA, Cox Communications, Verizon Fios, AT&T U-verse, Frontier FiOS, Dish Network, and Optimum West digital cable systems across the United States, and as an OTT Network available on Sling TV, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, and Apple TV.  Its headquarters are in Los Angeles, California. The service is divided into two distinct services, Kabillion, which features general audience programming, and Kabillion Girls Rule, which mainly features programming for both young girls and preschoolers. The services carry a mix of programs from both Splash Entertainment (formerly a part of MoonScoop Group) and other outside production companies. On April 29, 2013, Kabillion entered a partnership with Saban Brands to add programming from The CW's Vortexx block to the existing Kabillion service. Even with the discontinuance of Vortexx on September 27, 2014, a few shows from the block like Transformers Prime and Sonic X still remain on Kabillion.

Shortcake generally refers to a sweet cake or pastry that is typically round, with a soft, spongy texture, and a sweet, usually vanilla-flavored, frosting.  Shortcake is related to pound cake and pie crust. It is a type of cake that is generally not as dense as a pound cake or as rich as a pie crust. Shortcake is often served warm or at room temperature.

Assyriology (from Greek , AssyriƒÅ; and , logos, "word", "knowledge") is the scholarly study of Assyria, its history, culture, and language.  Assyriology emerged in the late 19th century as a result of new archaeological discoveries and the publication of ancient texts from Assyria. Since then, it has become one of the most vibrant and expanding academic disciplines in the world. Today, Assyriologists work on projects all over the world, from excavating new sites to translating ancient texts. They also teach at universities and colleges, and many have contributed to the understanding of ancient Mesopotamia and its culture.

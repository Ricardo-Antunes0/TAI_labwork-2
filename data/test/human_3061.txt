Chen Zilong (; 16081647) was a Chinese poet, essayist and official active during the Ming dynasty. Career In 1630, while in Beijing, Chen was introduced to an elderly Xu Guangqi, who shared that he had been working on an agricultural treatise. In 1635 — some two years after Xu's death — Chen returned to his hometown in Songjiang District and thereafter received the final draft of Xu's work from Xu's grandson Erjue. Four years later, Chen presented his "worked-over" version of Xu's manuscript to Nanjing governor Zhang Guowei and Songjiang prefect Fang Yuegong, both of whom pledged to assist with the book's publication once Chen was done editing it. Aided by some of Xu's grandchildren and fellow scholars from Songjiang, Chen undertook most of the editing and added "20 per cent" new material, including passages from later works as Zhang Guowei's Shuili quanshu (1639), Xu's earlier agricultural writing, and Chen's own opinions on Xu's writing. Chen titled the completed work Nong zhen quan shu , a "faithful mirror" of Xu's goal of improving the country's agricultural infrastructure, and it was presented to the Chongzhen Emperor in 1641. According to Frederic Wakeman, this was the "first compilation of statecraft writing" in China.

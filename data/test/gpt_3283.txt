Axe-monies refer to bronze artifacts found in Europe, dating from the 3rd millennium BCE to the late 1st millennium CE, that feature a socket at one end for an axe blade and a protrusion at the other end to form a handle. They were principally used as votive offerings in religious ceremonies, but also sometimes as tools.  Axe-monies were created in several different shapes and sizes, but typically featured a cylindrical body with a flattened top and a sharpened axe blade at one end. The socket at the other end was often decorated with a pattern or design. Some axe-monies were also decorated with silver or gold plating.  Axe-monies are thought to have been used primarily as votive offerings in religious ceremonies, but they were also occasionally used as tools. They are believed to have originated in Europe and been popular throughout the region. Today, only a few examples of axe-monies remain, and they are mostly located in museums or private collections.

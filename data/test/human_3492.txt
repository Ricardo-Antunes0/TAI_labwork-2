Casino Raiders is a 1989 Hong Kong action drama film written and directed by Jimmy Heung and Wong Jing and starring Andy Lau, Alan Tam, Idy Chan and Rosamund Kwan. It belonged to the early part of the 1989-1996 period, a period when gambling-themed films were dominating the Hong Kong movie scene. It was released one week after Fatal Bet, another film by Heung based on the same true story but filmed in English with different actors in the lead roles. The film was followed by two sequels, No Risk, No Gain (1990) and Casino Raiders II (1991), which have unrelated plots. Plot Crab Chan (Andy Lau) and Sam Law (Alan Tam) are a pair of renowned professional gamblers who are best friends. One day, a tycoon named Lung (Charles Heung) summons the two of them to his casino in Lake Tahoe to crack a scam led by a pair of Japanese gamblers, Kung (Hagiwara Kenzo) and his son Taro (Lung Fong). There, Crab and Sam also meet Koyan Tong (Idy Chan), a rich heiress from Hong Kong who is on vacation in the United States. Koyan and Sam also develop a relationship.

Informally, a Cadillac plan is any unusually comprehensive insurance coverage offered by a company.  Cadillac insurance plans are typically more comprehensive than the typical insurance policies offered by other companies. This can include coverage for accidental damage, theft, and even loss of income. Because Cadillac plans are so comprehensive, they can be a great option for people who need insurance that covers a wide range of potential risks.

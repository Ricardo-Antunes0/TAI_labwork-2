Dress for Excess is the second album released by the American rock band Kiss. It was released on October 12, 1976, by Casablanca Records.  The album is noted for its heavier sound and its cover art, which features the band members dressed in elaborately costumed outfits. "Dress for Excess" reached number 10 on the Billboard 200 chart and spawned the hit single "Detroit Rock City".  Kiss resumed touring in support of "Dress for Excess" in early 1977. However, tensions between band members were beginning to mount, and the tour proved to be a disaster. The group disbanded shortly after its conclusion.  In 2002, "Dress for Excess" was reissued on CD with five bonus tracks.

Edgar Hilsenrath (April 2, 1926 â€“ December 30, 2018) was a German-Jewish writer and Holocaust survivor. He wrote several fictional novels that gave an unvarnished view of the Holocaust which were partly based on his own experiences in a Nazi concentration camp. His main works are Night, The Nazi and the Barber, and The Story of the Last Thought. After fleeing Nazi Germany in 1944, he lived in Palestine and France, before settling in New York City in 1951 where he lived for 24 years and published his first novels. Although he was a naturalized United States citizen, he chose to return to Germany in 1975 where he lived until his death in 2018. Biography Born in Leipzig and raised in Halle, Hilsenrath was the son of David Hilsenrath, a furrier, and Anna (Honigsberg) Hilsenrath. In 1938 his father fled to France and his mother escaped with her two children to Siret (Sereth), in Romanian Bukovina where her parents lived. The sole Jewish student at his school, he was harassed and transferred to a parochial school. In 1941, at the time that he should have received an entrance card to higher education, he and his mother were interned in the ghetto of Mohyliv-Podilskyi (called "Transnistria") after German allied Romanian troupes took control of the region. After the Red Army liberated the ghetto in 1944, he used forged documents to board a refugee train to Mandatory Palestine in order to avoid being drafted into the Russian Army. There he obtained employment at a kibbutz where he worked for nearly three years. While there he contracted malaria.

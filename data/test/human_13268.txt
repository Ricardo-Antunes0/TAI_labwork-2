The College Tribune is a student newspaper which serves Ireland's largest third level institution, University College Dublin. It was established in 1989 with the assistance of journalist and broadcaster Vincent Browne who was attending the university as an evening student at the time. Browne noted the campus' lack of a news outlet which was independent of both the university and University College Dublin Students' Union and alongside founding editor Eamon Dillon set up the Tribune to correct this. Initially, a close working relationship was maintained between the Tribune and the Sunday Tribune which was at the time edited by Browne. This relationship afforded the paper the use of professional production facilities in its fledgling years. Ultimately however, the student newspaper would long outlast its national weekly counterpart with the Sunday Tribune having ceased publication in 2011. The College Tribune is UCD's oldest surviving newspaper having been published continuously for over 30 years. The current editor of the 35th volume of the paper is Conor Paterson. Print edition The print edition is circulated to over 50 locations at the university's Belfield and Blackrock campuses fortnightly during semesters one and two each year. Throughout its history, the College Tribune has been printed in tabloid format. Issues are typically 32 pages in length with the paper proper occupying 20 pages with news, features, science and technology, business, politics and innovation, Irish and sport. The remaining 12 pages are a pull-out arts and culture supplement The Trib which covers music, film, fashion, arts, satire and entertainment. The Trib, previously The Siren, was introduced during Volume 20 and was later renamed for the paper's nickname. The Tribune also includes a satire section named 'The Turbine' which was previously named the 'Angry Gerald'.

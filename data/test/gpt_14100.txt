Windsborn Crater Lake  is a water-filled impact crater located in the Libby and Windsborn quadrangles of the Elysium Planitia on Mars. The center of the crater is about in diameter, with a rim that has a diameter of about . The crater was named after American astronomer Theodore C. Winsborn.  The crater was first observed by the Viking 1 Orbiter in 1976, but it was not until the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) images from 2006 that it was determined to be a crater. The MRO found evidence for an ancient flow deposit around the crater's rim. The deposit is about thick, indicating that the water has accumulated there for at least 10,000 years. Windsborn Crater Lake is one of several water-filled impact craters on Mars.

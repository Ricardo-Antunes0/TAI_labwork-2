Company history  Lanner Group formed in 1996 after completing a Management Buyout from AT&T Istel; the company was initially named SEE WHY SOLUTIONS and was incorporated in 1995. Lanner Group's previous owner, AT&T Istel, formerly known as ISTEL, was initially called BL Systems, and was a spin out formed in 1979 following a Merger of all the computer departments under the then British Leyland umbrella. BL System's SEE WHY tool, programmed in Fortran 77 and launched in 1980, was the world's first commercially available visual interactive simulation package and the precursor to Lanner Group's current core software product WITNESS. WITNESS was the first of the industrial strength 4GL simulators. The WITNESS system was launched on IBM PC in 1986 and has been revised frequently since. The latest version of Lanner's Witness was released in summer 2017.

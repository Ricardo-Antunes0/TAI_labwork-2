A consortium of researchers in Bangladesh has sequenced the genome of a jute species, Jutea oleifera, to gain insights into the genetics and evolution of this important crop.  The jute genome is a valuable resource for researchers studying plant genetics and Evolution, because it provides insights into the evolution of this important crop. The sequencing was carried out at the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI), in collaboration with international partners, including the International Jute Genome Sequencing Consortium (IJGSC).  The IJGSC is a global consortium of researchers who are sequencing the genomes of jute plants to better understand their genetic diversity and how this has shaped their adaptation to different environments. The Jute genome is the first of its kind to be sequenced and assembled from such a wide range of locations.

Treponema socranskii was isolated from gum swabs of people with periodontitis and clinically-induced periodontitis. It is a motile, helically coiled, obligate anaerobe that grows best at 37 °C, and is a novel member of its genus because of its ability to ferment molecules that other Treponema species cannot. T. socranskii’s growth is positively correlated with gingival inflammation, which indicates that it is a leading cause of gingivitis and periodontitis. Discovery and isolation  Robert Smibert, John Johnson, and Richard Ranney isolated Treponema socranskii in Virginia, 1984. Volunteers with periodontitis and clinically-induced periodontitis supplied samples from beneath and above their gumlines for comparison to samples supplied from volunteers with healthy gums. The culture of T. socranskii were isolated from the samples supplied from the group of volunteers with periodontitis and clinically-induced periodontitis. Periodontitis is the lasting harmful inflammation of the gum line, and clinically-induced periodontitis is the condition in which healthy volunteers stop dental hygiene to induce periodontitis for controlled scientific study. Researchers used a medium that contained meat and salt water that was saturated with carbon dioxide to purge the sample of oxygen. These samples were cultured in duplicates on selective solid media plates after undergoing serial dilutions to ensure purity.  These plates were placed into GasPak jars to remove any oxygen that may be present in the jar. The researchers inoculated colonies from the plates into OTI (oral treponeme isolation) broth and placed them into another GasPak jar. The jars were kept at 37 °C, and every week the samples were checked using dark-field microscopy.

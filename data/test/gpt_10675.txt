The Waucantuck Mill Complex was a mill complex located in Waucantuck, Connecticut. It was the largest mill complex in New England, and formed part of the Waucantuck Silk Mill. The complex was destroyed by a fire in 1978.  The Waucantuck Mill Complex was located on the banks of the Farmington River in Waucantuck, Connecticut. The complex consisted of a mill building, a dam, a silk mill, and a power plant. The mill building was built in 1827 and was the largest mill complex in New England at the time. The complex produced silk thread and cloth from 1827 until 1978, when a fire destroyed the building and the dam. The power plant supplied electricity to the mill until 1940. The silk mill closed in 1956 and the dam was destroyed by flooding in 1978. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

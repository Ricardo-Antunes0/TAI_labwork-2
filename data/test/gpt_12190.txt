Veneto State (Veneto Stato, VS) was a state of the Italian Republic from 1946 to 1995. It was created after World War II following the forced annexation of the region by the Italian government. The state was named after the Venetian region of Veneto.  Veneto State was a federal state, divided into twenty-one provinces. Its capital was Venice.  The state had a population of 5,555,000 in 1995, making it the fourth most populous state in Italy. The majority of the population lived in the north-central and north-eastern provinces. The state's population grew rapidly during the 1960s and 1970s, as a result of mass migration from rural areas to the cities. In 1991 Veneto State had the sixth highest per capita income in Italy.  Veneto State was abolished in 1995 following a referendum on regional autonomy. Its territory was divided between two new provinces: Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino-Alto Adige/SÃ¼dtirol.

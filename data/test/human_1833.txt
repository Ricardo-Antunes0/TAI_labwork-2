Alva Earl Campbell Jr. (April 30, 1948 – March 3, 2018) was an American murderer from Ohio at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution in Chillicothe, Ohio. He was convicted of the 1997 murder of 18-year-old Charles Dials (November 30, 1978 – April 2, 1997) in Franklin County. Background Born in 1948, one of six siblings, he suffered an abusive home life. Between 1959-65, he was placed in “two different residential treatment facilities in Pennsylvania, nine separate detention  center placements [and] two different foster homes." His father was committed to the Lima State Hospital for raping one of Campbell's sisters. Campbell's mother was complicit in prostituting Campbell's sisters in exchange for money and alcohol when the girls were teenagers, and one of Campbell's sisters became pregnant at age 15, Stebbins described. Campbell and his sisters were finally removed from their mother's care after the children entered a bar and begged for food.

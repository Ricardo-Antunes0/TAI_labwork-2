The Ringlemere barrow is an archaeological site in Ringlemere, near the village of Ringlemere in the English county of Surrey. The barrow was first noted in 1795, and has been studied since the early 19th century. It is one of the largest and most complete Neolithic chambered tombs in southern England, and one of the most important examples of late Neolithic and early Bronze Age funerary practices in the area.  The barrow is located on a natural terrace overlooking the River Wey, and consists of a large central chamber, flanked by two smaller chambers on either side. The chamber has a central pier supporting a roof, and is entered through a narrow passage located in the middle of the front wall. The roof is supported by four large uprights, each flanked by two smaller posts. The interior walls are decorated with carvings of animals and human figures, as well as elaborate geometric designs. The site was first excavated between 1852 and 1854 by Augustus Pitt Rivers, who identified fourteen burials within the chamber, including six individuals who had been buried with their weapons and tools nearby. The barrow remains one of the most important archaeological sites in southern England, and has been designated a Grade I listed building.

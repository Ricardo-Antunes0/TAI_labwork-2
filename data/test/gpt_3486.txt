Feeler was supposed to have been the first Toadies album, recorded in 1983 and released on Epitaph Records. However, the album was never released, and the band re-recorded it for their 1990 debut album, Rubberneck.  The name Feeler comes from a combination of the words "feel" and "seeker". The album's original title was "Feeler 1", but this was changed to "Feeler" after the first song was recorded. The album was never released, and the band re-recorded it for their 1990 debut album, Rubberneck.   According to founding member Donnie yen, Feeler was recorded at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California. The band originally intended to release the album on Epitaph Records, but when they were unable to get the rights to use the songs "I'm Just a Man" and "She's Got Balls", they decided to release the album independently.  The album has never been released commercially, but bootlegs of the original recordings circulate online.

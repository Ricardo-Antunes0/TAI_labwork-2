Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), originally called BOLD contrast-enhanced MRI (BCEM), is a novel MRI technique that uses susceptibility weighted imaging to enhance the contrast between gray and white matter.  SWI is a sensitive and specific technique that can be used to detect damage to the brain, spinal cord, and other organs. SWI is also useful for assessing the effects of disease on these structures.  The susceptibility weighting process used in SWI creates a map of the relative susceptibilities of different types of tissue to magnetic fields. This information allows SWI to enhance the contrast between gray and white matter, which is especially useful for detecting damage to these structures.  SWI has been widely used in studies of the brain, spinal cord, and other organs. It is also being used to assess the effects of disease on these structures.

SM UB-21 was a German Type UB II submarine, the first of the U-boats built in Nazi Germany. Commissioned into service on 10 November 1940, she was sunk on 23 February 1941 by depth charges from the British destroyer HMS Arrow.  SM UB-21 was one of only two Type UB II submarines ever built, and the only one to see active service in World War II. She was armed with six torpedo tubes and a deck gun, and was intended as a replacement for the earlier Type UB I submarines.  Despite her relatively short career, SM UB-21 played an important role in the early stages of World War II. She sank five Allied ships in her first six months of service, including the British freighter Empire Star in December 1940. In February 1941, she was sunk by depth charges from the British destroyer HMS Arrow.

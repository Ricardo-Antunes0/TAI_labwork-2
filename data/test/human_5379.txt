Brian Shaw (28 June 1928 – 2 April 1992) was a British ballet dancer and teacher. As a leading dancer with the Royal Ballet during the 1950s and 1960s, he was widely regarded as "one of the finest classical male dancers of his generation". Early life and training Brian Earnshaw was born in Huddersfield, England, a large market town in West Yorkshire, halfway between Leeds and Manchester. Having begun his dance studies in his home town, he moved to London as a teenager and continued his training at the Sadler's Wells Ballet School. In the summer of 1943, in the midst of World War II, Londoners were "keeping calm and carrying on," as they were advised to do by the British Ministry of Information. In July, the Production Club of the Royal Academy of Dancing arranged a matinee performance of Sadler's Wells students in Suite of Dances, set by resident choreographer Andrée Howard to Handel's jauntily life-affirming Water Music. Among the talented students dancing that afternoon were Philip Chatfield and Brian Earnshaw, both of whom were destined to have distinguished careers with the Sadler's Wells Ballet, later known as the Royal Ballet.

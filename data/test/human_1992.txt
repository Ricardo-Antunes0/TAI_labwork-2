Zaynaddīn Ibn al-ʿAjamī, also known as ʿAbdalmalik b. Sharafaddīn ʿAbdallāh b. ʿAbdarraḥmān Ibn al-Karābīsī (Dhū l-Qaʿda 591–25 Dhū l-Qaʿda 674 AH/October 1195–11 May 1276 CE), was a literary and religious scholar of Aleppo, associated with the court of the Ayyubid sultan al-Malik al-Nāṣir Yūsuf (r. 634–658/1236–1260). He is noted for composing the first surviving Arabic riddle-collection by a single author, which is also 'the second oldest surviving Arabic work solely devoted to riddles'. Life  Ibn al-ʿAjamī was born into the Banū l-ʿAjamī, the pre-eminent exponents of the Shāfiʿī school of jurisprudence in Aleppo eleventh- to twelfth-century Aleppo. Their epithet al-ʿAjamī ('the Persian') reflected the family's roots in Nishapur, and their political position was bolstered by the Ayyubid dynasty's adherence to Shāfiʿī thought. Ibn al-ʿAjamī studied with Bahāʾaddīn Ibn Shaddād (539–632/1145–1235), Iftikhāraddīn al-Hāshimī(539–616/1144–1219), ʿAbdarraḥmān Ibn al-Ustādh (a.k.a. Ibn ʿAlwān, d. 623/1226), and Muwaffaqaddīn Ibn Yaʿīsh (553–643/1158–1245). In 616/1219–20 Ibn al-ʿAjamī was appointed as a qadī; he became a muʿīd at the Sayfiyya madrassa in 617/1220, and was participating in Alepine court life by the 1230s. He gained a teaching position at the Nūriyya madrasa in 656/1258–59, also becoming head of the ṣūfī orders. For the months Muḥarram–Ǧumādā 1659/January–May 1261 achieved the position of judge, but Mongol invasions led him to flee to Damascus, where he became a deputy for the qadi Ibn Khallikān (608–681/1211–1282). The pressure of Mongol invasions led him to retreat further in 661/1262–63, to Cairo, where he gained a position at the mosque of Ibn Ruzzīk through the offices of the qadī Tājaddīn ʿAbdalwahhāb b. Khalaf (d. 665/1266–67). He continued legal work under Tājaddīn’s successor, Taqīyaddīn Ibn Razīn until his death. He was inhumed in the Muqaṭṭam cemetery, close to the tomb of al-Shāfiʿī himself.

James Cox (11 October 1846, in Snodshill, Wiltshire â€“ 25 October 1910, in Bournemouth) was a British labourer and trade unionist.  James Cox was born on 11 October 1846 in Snodshill, Wiltshire to a poor family. He left school at the age of 12 and began working as a labourer.  Cox became involved in trade unionism in the 1870s, and became a member of the Amalgamated Society of Builders and Contractors (ASBC) in 1876. He also became involved in the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR), and was elected to its executive committee in 1894.  Cox played an important role in the union's campaigns for improved wages and conditions for labourers, and he was also active in union organising efforts in Southampton and Dorset. He was elected to the Bournemouth Borough Council in 1892, but died five years later from tuberculosis.  Cox was recognised as an important figure in British labour history, and he has been described as "one of the most colourful and significant figures in the history of the British labour movement". He is also recognised as one of the founders of the British trade unions' youth wing, the Boy Scouts Association.  James Cox died on 25 October 1910 after a long battle with tuberculosis. He was buried at Eastleigh Cemetery in Bournemouth.

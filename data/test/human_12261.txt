Publius Calvisius Ruso was a Roman senator, who was active during the Flavian dynasty. He was suffect consul in the nundinium of March-June 79 as the colleague of Lucius Junius Caesennius Paetus. A shadowy and enigmatic figure, many of the facts of Ruso's life have been debated by the experts. It is not disputed that Ruso was the son of the homonymous consul of 53. However, the existence of a Publius Calvisius Ruso Julius Frontinus, attested by an inscription found in Pisidian Antioch, complicates matters. At first, the consensus accepted Hermann Dessau's explanation that the two were the same man, and the inscription from Antioch merely demonstrated that Ruso had a polyonomous name, despite that the inscription also attested to a governorship of the combined province of Cappadocia-Galatia that had to be dated to the years 104 to 109. Dessau further identified this man as the husband of Dasumia, and thus great-grandfather of the emperor Marcus Aurelius.

Kneeboarding is a discipline of surfing where the surfer rides on a small platform that is mounted on the board. The platform is attached to the board by means of straps or a metal frame.  Kneeboarding was invented in 1988 by Hawaiian surfer Kelly Slater. Slater's original platform was made from a surfboard and an inflatable raft. He named his invention "kneeboarding" because it felt like he was riding on the boards of ocean waves.   Today, kneeboarding is one of the most popular forms of surfing. It is especially popular in Hawaii, where it is used to access waves that are too big or too dangerous to surf on a traditional surfboard.

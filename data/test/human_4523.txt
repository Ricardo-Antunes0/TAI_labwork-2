The Wonder (foaled 1978) was a French-bred Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. The Wonder was one of the best horses of his generation in France at two, three and four years of age: his wins included the Prix de Condé, Critérium de Saint-Cloud, Prix Greffulhe, Prix d'Ispahan, Prix Edmond Blanc and Prix Jacques Le Marois. In 1983 he was transferred to the United States where he won the San Bernardino Handicap, Century Handicap and Californian Stakes. He was then retired to stud where he had moderate success as a sire of winners. Background The Wonder was a "tall, lengthy" dark brown horse with no white markings bred in France by Alain du Breil, the president of the Societe de Steeple-Chases, the governing body of French jump racing. He was the only horse of any consequence sired by Wittgenstein, a Florida-bred stallion who won the Critérium de Maisons-Laffitte in 1973. The Wonder was the first foal of The Lark, the only Thoroughbred mare owned by du Breil. She later produced the Badener Sprint-Cup winner Areias. The Wonder originally raced in the colours of du Breil's wife and was trained by Jacques de Chevigny.

is the 36th single by the Japanese singer Ayumi Hamasaki. The single was released on February 10, 2009. The title track is a cover of the song "Labrador Retriever" by the American singer Sheryl Crow.  Hamasaki began work on the single in 2007, shortly after finishing her international tour for her previous single "Distance". She considered several songs to cover for the single, but ultimately decided on "Labrador Retriever" because she felt it would be a good fit for her style. The song was originally recorded by Sheryl Crow in 2002 and became a hit in the United States. Hamasaki's cover features a new arrangement and her own vocals.  "Labrador Retriever" was well received by critics. Pete Bradley of About.com said that Hamasaki's voice is "perfect" for the song and that her version is "a refreshing change of pace". He added that the song is "catchy and fun". A reviewer for Popjustice called it an "absolute belter", while another critic called it one of Hamasaki's best singles in years. The single debuted at number two on the Oricon charts, selling over 138,000 copies in its first week of release. It has since been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ).

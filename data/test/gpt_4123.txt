Convergence Démocratique (CD; ) was a Haitian political party founded in 1991. The CD was led by Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who served as its president from 1996 until his ouster in 2004.  The CD contested the 1991 parliamentary elections, but failed to win a single seat. In the 1995 presidential elections, it placed second behind Gérard Latortue. In the 1998 parliamentary elections, the CD won two seats. In the 2002 presidential elections, Aristide was re-elected with 73% of the vote.  In 2004, following debates within the party over Aristide's policies and his relationship with then-president Jacques Chirac, Chirac decided to remove Aristide from power. This led to the 2004 Haitian coup d'état, during which Aristide was ousted and replaced by René Préval.   The CD subsequently merged into the Ligue Démocratique et Populaire (LDP) in 2005.

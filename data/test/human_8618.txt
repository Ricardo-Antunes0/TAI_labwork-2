The Nieuport-Delage NiD 43 was a single engine, two seat biplane fighter aircraft designed and built for shipboard use in France in 1924. Design and development The NiD 43 was designed to meet a naval requirement for a two-seat shipborne fighter. It was a two bay biplane, with unswept, constant chord, unstaggered wings braced by parallel pairs of interplane struts. There were ailerons on the lower wings alone. Its fuselage was flat sided, with two open cockpits.  The pilot sat in the forward one under the wing trailing edge, where there was a cut-out to enhance his upward view, and the gunner was positioned close behind with a pair of Lewis machine guns mounted on a prominent ring. The tail was conventional, with a tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage and braced with two parallel struts on each side, a broad fin with a curved leading edge and a deep, straight edged rudder.

Beat the Chefs is an American television cooking game show broadcast by Game Show Network (GSN) and hosted by Matt Rogers. The series features contestants preparing a home-cooked family recipe, while professional chefs Beau MacMillan, Antonia Lofaso and Jeff Henderson make the same recipe in an upscale restaurant version. The two dishes are then judged by a panel of food critics who are Christy Jordan and Brad A Johnson. The series premiered on August 23, 2012, and aired its last episode on September 13, 2012. Format The series features two families, one in each half-hour of the episode, preparing their family recipe while the professional chefs cook a restaurant version of the same meal. The family begins by revealing the dish they have selected to cook to the chefs as well as how longer they think it will take to prepare it. The chefs are then given the same amount of time to create their own version. Once the first cook-off is complete, the second family is brought out, and the procedure is repeated with their own meal. After the second cook-off, the judges reveal the winning dish from each round. If the family's home cooked meal beats the chefs' professional version, the family wins $25,000, if the chefs win, the family receives $1,000 worth of kitchen supplies.

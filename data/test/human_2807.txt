Ōga Atsushi (born 22 October 1977 as Atsushi Moriyasu) is a former sumo wrestler from Nogata, Fukuoka, Japan. His highest rank was jūryō 6. He was well known to sumo audiences for his performance of the bow twirling ceremony (yumitori-shiki) which takes place at the end of every tournament day, a role he began in 2004. It is normally performed by an apprentice ranked in the makushita division or below, but Ōga continued to do it even after promotion to the jūryō division. Career He was born Atushi Moriyasu in Nōgata, Fukuoka, the same city that ōzeki Kaiō came from, and they went to the same middle school. Moriyasu admired Kaiō greatly and when he joined professional sumo he deliberately avoided Kaiō's Tomozuna stable, hoping to one day face him in a tournament. He chose Takasago stable instead and made his first appearance at the March tournament of 1993, fighting under his family name of Moriyasu. He was just  tall and weighed only  in his debut tournament. In the lower divisions he served as a tsukebito or personal attendant to a number of senior wrestlers in Takasago stable such as Mitoizumi and Toki.  In May 2001 he changed his shikona to Ōga, with the "ō" character taken from his idol Kaiō and second "ki" from Toki, which can also be read as "ga."  He changed the second part of his shikona from Atsushi to Akitoshi at the same time. He was to change this again to Tosa and then finally Atsushi once more, his real given name.

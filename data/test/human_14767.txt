A luminous efficiency function or luminosity function represents the average spectral sensitivity of human visual perception of light. It is based on subjective judgements of which of a pair of different-colored lights is brighter, to describe relative sensitivity to light of different wavelengths.  It is not an absolute reference to any particular individual, but is a standard observer representation of visual sensitivity of theoretical human eye. It is valuable as a baseline for experimental purposes, and in colorimetry.  Different luminous efficiency functions apply under different lighting conditions, varying from photopic in brightly lit conditions through mesotopic to scotopic under low lighting conditions.  When not specified, the luminous efficiency function generally refers to the photopic luminous efficiency function. The CIE photopic luminous efficiency function  or  is a standard function established by the Commission Internationale de l'Ã‰clairage (CIE) and may be used to convert radiant energy into luminous (i.e., visible) energy.  It also forms the central color matching function in the CIE 1931 color space.

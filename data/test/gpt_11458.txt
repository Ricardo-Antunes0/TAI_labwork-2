Gergesa, also Gergasa (Γέργεσα in Byzantine greek) is a town in the municipal unit of Gergesa, Corinthia, Greece. The town has a population of 2,819 according to the 2011 census. The town is situated at an altitude of 710 meters above sea level, 5 km southeast of Gergesa and 12 km northwest of Corinth.  Gergesa is first mentioned in the 5th century BC as a settlement of the Dorian tribe of the Megarians. In the 4th century BC it became part of the Athenian Empire and was ruled by a pro-Athenian oligarchy. In 146 BC it was captured by Rome and became a colony. It remained a Roman colony until its annexation by the Byzantine Empire in the 7th century AD.  The town flourished during the Byzantine period and played an important role in the economy of Corinthia. The town was sacked by the Arabs in 614 AD and by the Normans in 1084 AD. It remained under Byzantine rule until it was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1460 AD. The Ottoman period was marked by decline and Gergesa became a small village with a population of about 200 people.  The town has been restored and modernized during recent years and has regained its former importance as a tourist destination. Today, Gergesa is a small but picturesque town with a rich history and beautiful architecture.

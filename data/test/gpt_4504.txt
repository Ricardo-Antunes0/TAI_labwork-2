Hermann Stoll (13 June 1904 in Eschenau, Bavaria – 9 October 1988 in Munich) was an East German historian.  Born into a Protestant family, in 1922 he finished his secondary education in the town of Görlitz. From 1924 to 1928 he studied history at the Universities of Freiburg and Berlin, where he was influenced by the work of Ernst Nolte and Walter Laqueur. In 1928 he completed his doctorate with a dissertation on the French Revolution which was published in 1931.  In 1932 Stoll became an assistant professor at the University of Halle-Wittenberg, where he remained until 1945. In 1937 he was appointed head of the department of modern history at the University of Königsberg, and from 1946 to 1958 he was a professor at the University of Munich.  During the Second World War Stoll served as a military historian in the Wehrmacht, reaching the rank of colonel. After the war he resumed his academic career, becoming rector of the University of Munich in 1972 and president of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 1978. He died in Munich in 1988.  Stoll is known for his studies of German history, particularly 18th century Germany, Prussia and Napoleonic France. His best-known work is probably his three-volume History of Prussia (1881-1902), which has been praised as one of the most important scholarly works on Prussia ever written.

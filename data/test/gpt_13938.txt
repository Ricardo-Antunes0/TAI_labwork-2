Ronald W. Yeung (born 1945) is a Canadian-born contemporary artist. Active since the late 1960s, Yeung is known for his conceptual art, assemblages and installation pieces.  Yeung was born in 1945 in Toronto, Canada. He attended the Ontario College of Art and Design in Toronto and earned his BFA in 1967. Yeung settled in New York City in the early 1970s and started exhibiting his work there. In 1976, he moved to Berlin, where he has lived since then.  Yeung's work is often based on his own personal experiences and observations, as well as on concepts such as entropy and the cyclical nature of life. His installations often feature a variety of objects that are usually out of place or have been recycled from other sources. Yeung has said that his goal is to "create works that are emotionally charged and make people think".  Yeung has exhibited his work around the world, including at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Tate Gallery in London, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. He was awarded the Order of Canada in 2004 and the National Arts Centre Award in 2006. Yeung died on January 2, 2017 at the age of 73.

The tympanum is brown and distinct, covered by the supra-tympanic fold in its upper part. The fingers have no webbing but bear discs that are much wider than the digits. The toes are about one-fourth webbed and bear discs that are slightly smaller than the finger discs. The dorsum is in most individuals uniform brown, but some have a paler mid-dorsal mark. Skin is smooth dorsally and granular on flanks, belly, and proximal postero-ventral surfaces of the thighs.

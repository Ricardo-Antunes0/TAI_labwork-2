Agesilochus or Hegesilochus (Gr. ,  or ), son of Hegesippus, was an early Greek sculptor who is credited with the invention of the chisel.  Agesilochus is principally known for his sculpture of horses, which show great skill in depicting their natural movements. He also made smaller pieces, such as a drinking cup with the head of a horse on the stem. His works are considered some of the earliest examples of Greek sculpture.

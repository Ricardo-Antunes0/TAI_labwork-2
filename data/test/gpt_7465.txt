The bit is an important item of horse tack. It provides guidance and control to the horse, and is used to prevent the horse from biting or pulling on the rider's hands or arms.   The bit is made of metal, wood, or plastic and is generally shaped like a cross or U. It has a slot in the center that fits over the horse's upper lip, and is fastened to the bridle with a ring or a strap. When ridden in a circle, the bit guides the horse's head in a specific direction.

The Peridot Mesa vent is a part of the Salton Sea, an endorheic basin located in southern California. The Peridot Mesa vent emits a gas and dust plume that extends approximately 5 nautical miles from the vent. Satellite imagery has shown that the active vent has significantly reduced in size over the past several years, likely due to declining gas and dust production.

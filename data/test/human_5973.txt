Saint Amon of Toul (otherwise Aimo or Amand) (fl. 375; date of death unknown, but perhaps c 423) was the second recorded bishop of Toul  and is venerated as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church. Biography Little is now known of Amon except for his name and office, although there are legends about him. He was the successor of Saint Mansuy as bishop of Toul, a post he held from around 375 to his death. This is sometimes placed in around 423, but could have taken place considerably earlier or later. There is a tradition, for example, that he left the city of Toul to escape the devastating retreat of Attila the Hun and his forces after their defeat at the Battle of Ch√¢lons in 451. A rock, which was an obstacle on the road of the prelate, was said to have opened and closed over him to hide him from his barbarous pursuers. Today this place, a small rise overlooking the village of Goviller, is called the "Bois d'Anon" ("Amon's wood").

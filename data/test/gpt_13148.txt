The Hamburger Schule (German for 'Hamburg School') is a former school in Hamburg, Germany that specialized in teaching hamburgers and related culinary arts. The school closed in 2006.  The Hamburger Schule was founded in 1966 by Rolf Wahl, who had been trained at the Berliner Kochschule. At first, the school offered classes on how to make Hamburgers from beef, pork, veal and lamb, as well as vegetarian versions. In 1972, the school introduced a new course that focused on the history and preparation of Hamburgers. In 1977, the school opened its own restaurant, which became a popular spot for Hamburgers in Hamburg. In 2006, the school closed due to financial difficulties.

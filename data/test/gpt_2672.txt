Manie Payne Ferguson (1850 – 8 June 1911) was an Australian poet and writer. He is best known for his book, The Man from Snowy River.  Ferguson was born in 1850 at West Maitland, New South Wales, Australia to parents Manie and Isabella (née Payne). He grew up on the family property, Snowy River Station, which was later acquired by the Australian government and is now a national park. Ferguson attended state school in Maitland and then studied at the University of Sydney. After leaving university he travelled around Australia for several years before settling in Melbourne in 1879.  In Melbourne, Ferguson began writing for newspapers and magazines, and also published a number of short stories. His first book, The Man from Snowy River, was published in 1884. It is a story about the adventures of an Aboriginal man named Pilli Wirrka. The book was well received and has been described as one of the most significant Australian books of the 19th century. Ferguson continued to write books, poems and articles throughout his life, many of which have been published posthumously. He died in 1911 at his home in Melbourne after a long illness.

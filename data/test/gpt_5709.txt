In the Battle of al-Buqaia in 1163, the Ayyubids, led by Saladin, decisively defeated the Crusaders.  After the Battle of Hattin in 1187, Saladin emerged as the most powerful Muslim ruler in the Levant. In 1188, he captured Jerusalem from the Christians, and in 1192 he recaptured Antioch from the Byzantines. In 1193, he marched on Damascus, but was forced to retreat after a sharp campaign in which he was wounded.  In 1195, Saladin launched another campaign against Damascus and this time succeeded in defeating the Christian forces. He then marched on Cairo, which capitulated after a short siege. Saladin then extended his rule to North Africa and Spain.

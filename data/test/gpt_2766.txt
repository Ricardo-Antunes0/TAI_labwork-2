In political science, political apathy is a state of mind where individuals do not participate in political affairs or express their political views.  There are a number of reasons why people may become apathetic to politics. Some people may feel that they have little to no impact on the political process, while others may be disillusioned with the current state of politics. Apathy can also be a result of exposure to politics only through negative media coverage or from personal experience with political corruption.  Despite the various causes, apathy has been shown to be a persistent phenomenon in many countries around the world. In some cases, apathy has led to increased levels of political violence and extremism. Efforts to address political apathy are therefore important both for the preservation of democracy and for the prevention of violence.

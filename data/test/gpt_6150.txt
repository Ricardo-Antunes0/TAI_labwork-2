The cuckooshrikes and allies in the family Cuculidae are a group of Old World passerine birds. These birds are variable in size, with most being around 12 cm long and weighing around 50 g. They have strong legs and long toes, which give them great agility in the air. They feed on insects, especially termites, but also consume small vertebrates.   The cuckooshrikes are found in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia. Their preferred habitat is open woodland, but they will also inhabit scrub and other dense vegetation. They are monogamous and build their nests on the ground. The cuckooshrikes are not particularly threatened, but their range is shrinking due to the spread of agricultural land and development.

The Sachar Committee was a seven-member High-Level Committee appointed in 2005 by the government of India to inquire into the condition of Muslims in India.  The Sachar Committee was headed by Justice R. C. Sachar and included members from all political parties in the Indian Parliament. The Committee submitted its report, "Equal Rights, Full Participation: A Report on the Status of Muslims in India", on 3 January 2007. The report highlighted significant socio-economic disparities between Muslims and Hindus in India and recommended a number of measures designed to redress these disparities.  The Sachar Committee was created as a result of mounting public concern about the level of violence and discrimination against Muslims in India. The Committee's mandate was to investigate the socio-economic conditions of Muslims in India, including their access to education, health care, employment and housing; their participation in socio-economic life; and their exposure to violence and hate crimes. The Committee also examined the impact of discriminatory legislation on the Muslim community in India.

The Wirrimbirra Sanctuary is a heritage-listed fauna sanctuary, native plant nursery, education centre and flora sanctuary located off the Hume Highway at 1305 Remembrance Drive, in outer south-western Sydney in the settlement of Bargo in the Wollondilly Shire local government area of New South Wales, Australia. It was built in 1962 by the Stead Foundation. The property is owned by the National Trust of Australia. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002. History  Land on which the sanctuary is situated was acquired in a number of ways. In 1962, a Sydney accountant, Carmen Coleman, discovered this interesting area of remnant bush where Europeans at Bargo made the first sightings of koala and lyrebird. Carmen Coleman donated the parcel of land at Bargo to the David G. Stead Memorial Wildlife Research Foundation, which was established in 1963 to perpetuate the memory of David Stead who was a pioneer of nature conservation in Australia. The National Trust began its association with the Stead Foundation and the Sanctuary in 1963.

Coity Mountain (also spelled Coety Mountain, Welsh: Mynydd Coety) is a flat-topped mountain in the South Wales Valleys, between Blaenavon and Abertillery. The highest points of both Torfaen and Blaenau Gwent unitary authorities are at the summit of Coity Mountain. The summit is also known as Twyn Ffynhonnau Goerion. Some  to the southeast lies a major subsidiary top of the hill, Mynydd Varteg Fawr (549m) at the southeastern end of whose broad ridge is a trig point at 544m. A few hundred metres to the southeast of this summit is a memorial known as the "Dog Stone" which commemorates Carlo the Red Setter, a dog shot accidentally by his master while hunting on the 12 August 1864. Co-ordinates for the Dog Stone 51.45'15.58N 3.05'08.81W. Other notable tops include those of Mulfran (524m) (Welsh for cormorant, pronounced 'mill-vran') which overlooks the town of Brynmawr and Mynydd James immediately east of the town of Blaina. Much of the mountain, including the summit is included in the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape World Heritage Site, and a labyrinth of coal mines, including Big Pit National Coal Museum lies under the mountain.

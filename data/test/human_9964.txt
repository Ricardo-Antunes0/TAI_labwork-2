Calomys cerqueirai is a species of rodent in the genus Calomys from southeastern Brazil. Distinct from other Calomys in its karyotype and characters of the fur, it is known only from two places in Minas Gerais. The karyotype was first described in 1996 and the species was formally named in 2010. Taxonomy  In 1996, Geise and coworkers described a new karyotypic variant of Calomys from Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais with 36 chromosomes and a fundamental number of 66 autosomal arms (2n = 36, FNa = 66), and a 2007 genetic analysis confirmed that the new variant represents an evolutionary lineage separate from other Calomys species. In 2010, Bonvicino and others described another karyotypic variant from Capitão Andrade, also in Minas Gerais, with 2n = 38 and FNa = 66, and concluded that both karyotypic variants represented a single, previously undescribed species, which they named Calomys cerqueirai. The specific name honors Brazilian mammalogist Rui Cerqueira. A single fusion or fission event is sufficient to derive one of the two karyotypes from the other.

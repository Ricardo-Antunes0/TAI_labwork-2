Charles Edward Hamm (April 21, 1925 â€“ February 25, 2015) was an American chemist who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2003 with Rolf Heuer and Jean-Pierre Sauvage for their work on chiral molecules.  Charles Hamm was born in 1925 in Waco, Texas. After earning his bachelor's degree in chemistry from Baylor University, Hamm went on to receive a doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley. Hamm's early research focused on the development of new catalysts and methods for synthesizing complex chemicals.  In the 1970s, Hamm began to study chiral molecules, which are substances that have two identical but different mirror images. This research led to the development of new pharmaceuticals and other products. Hamm's work earned him the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Hamm died at the age of 89 on February 25, 2015.

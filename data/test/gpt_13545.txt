Abu Izzadeen (, Abū ‘Izz ad-Dīn; born Tariq al-Baghdadi, ; 21 January 1965) is an Iraqi Sunni Muslim cleric and the founder and leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a terrorist organisation.  Born in 1965 in Baghdad, Iraq, Abu Izzadeen was born into a Sunni family. He was educated at an Islamic religious school in Baghdad, and later at Al-Azhar University, where he earned a degree in Islamic law. After graduation, he travelled to Saudi Arabia to study Hadith under Sheikh Abdul Aziz ibn Baz. He later returned to Iraq and began preaching Islam on college campuses.  In 1999, Abu Izzadeen formed the Mujahideen Shura Council, an umbrella organisation for Sunni militant groups fighting against American troops in Iraq. The organisation was banned by the U.S. authorities, but Abu Izzadeen continued to lead it from exile in Syria. In 2003, he joined Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), which merged with other insurgent groups to form ISIL in 2006.  Abu Izzadeen has been designated as a terrorist by the United States, the European Union, and Canada. He has been accused of leading ISIL's jihadist ideology and overseeing its operations, including its brutal tactics of execution and torture. In December 2014, the United States Department of State announced that it had offered a reward of up to $10 million for information that leads to his capture or death.

Background  Speaking of Alien, Beam said:I just want people to realize that they are not the only ones who feel alienated in life. Whether that's a good or bad thing, you have to walk a narrow road. You feel alienated because you discern a certain thing that people don't understand. You get to digest a piece of my brain and get to know me on an artistic level with this album.

Organopalladium chemistry is a branch of organometallic chemistry that deals with organic palladium compounds and their reactions. Palladium is often used as a catalyst in the reduction of alkenes and alkynes with hydrogen. This process involves the formation of a palladium-carbon covalent bond. Palladium is also prominent in carbon-carbon coupling reactions, as demonstrated in tandem reactions. Organopalladium chemistry timeline   1873 - A. N. Zaitsev reports reduction of benzophenone over palladium with hydrogen.  1894 - Phillips reports that palladium(II) chloride reduces to palladium metal by contact with ethylene.  1907 - Autoclave technology introduced by Vladimir Ipatieff makes it possible to carry out high pressure hydrogenation.  1956 - In the Wacker process  ethylene and oxygen react to acetaldehyde with catalyst PdCl2/CuCl2  1957 - Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) is reported by Malatesta and Angoletta.  1972 - The Heck reaction  is a coupling reaction of a halogenide with an olefin. Pd(0) intermediates are implicated.  1973 - The Trost asymmetric allylic alkylation is a nucleophilic substitution.  1975 - The Sonogashira coupling is a coupling reaction of terminal alkynes with aryl or vinyl halides.  1994 - The  Pd-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig amination for C-N bond-forming reactions.

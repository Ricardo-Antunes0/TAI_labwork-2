Stanisław Kowalski (born 14 April 1910) is a Polish composer and music theorist. He is considered one of the leading composers of the 20th century, and is known for his neoclassical and modernist works.  Kowalski was born in Siedlce, then part of the Russian Empire. After studying at the Warsaw Conservatory and the Royal Academy of Music in London, he settled in Paris in 1939. There, he became associated with the School of Parisian Moderne, which emphasized modernist techniques in composition. In 1945 he moved to the United States, where he taught at Mills College and the University of California, Berkeley. He returned to Poland in 1984 and now lives in Kraków.  Kowalski's compositions are noted for their lyrical expression, dramatic intensity, and use of classical and modern harmonic techniques. He has been called "one of the most important composers of our time" by The New York Times. His works have been performed by leading orchestras around the world, including the Berlin Philharmonic, Cleveland Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Vienna Symphony Orchestra, and Warsaw Philharmonic.

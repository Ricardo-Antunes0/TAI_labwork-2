Joseph Allard (December 31, 1910 â€“ May 9, 1984) was a French-American mathematician who worked in the fields of real analysis, functional analysis, and differential geometry.  Allard was born in Paris, France, to a family of scientists. He attended the University of Paris, where he received his doctorate in 1931 under the supervision of Alain Connes. After a year as a postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University, he returned to the University of Paris as a full professor in 1935. In 1947 he moved to the United States and became a United States citizen in 1956. He retired from Harvard University in 1978.  Allard's work in real analysis included contributions to the theory of harmonic functions, elliptic curves, and quasiconvex functions. His work in functional analysis included important results on Banach spaces, quasi-analytic functions, and integral transforms. His work in differential geometry included contributions to the theory of Riemannian manifolds, the calculus of variations, and the theory of geodesics. He also wrote books on these subjects.  Allard was elected member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1971. He received the Bourbaki Prize in 1977 and the Wolf Prize in 1982. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Cambridge in 1978 and an honorary doctorate from Brown University in 1981.  Joseph Allard died on May 9, 1984 at age 77 after a long illness.

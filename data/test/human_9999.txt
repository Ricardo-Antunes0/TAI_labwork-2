A famiclone is a colloquial name given to any clone console of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), known in Japan as the Family Computer or Famicom. They are electronic hardware devices designed to replicate the workings of, and play games designed for, the NES and Famicom. Hundreds of unauthorized clones and unlicensed copies have been made available since the height of the NES popularity in the late 1980s. The technology employed in such clones has evolved over the years: while the earliest clones feature a printed circuit board containing custom or third party integrated circuits (ICs), more recent (post-1996) clones utilize single chip designs, with a custom ASIC which simulates the functionality of the original hardware, and often includes one or more on-board games. Most devices originate in China and Taiwan, and less commonly South Korea. In some locales, especially former Eastern Bloc, former Soviet Union countries, South America, various Asian countries, and Africa such systems could occasionally be found side by side with official Nintendo hardware, and the NES was only available in low quantities so such clones were the easiest available console gaming systems. Such was the case with the Dendy (including the Dendy Junior), a particularly successful Famiclone which achieved widespread popularity in Russia and former Soviet republics in the early 1990s. Elsewhere, these systems were often prompting swift legal action. Many of these early systems were similar to the NES or Famicom not only in functionality, but also in appearance, often featuring little more than a new name and logo in place of Nintendo's branding. As opposed to that, in former Yugoslavia NES clones often visually resembled Mega Drive, together with the Sega logo.

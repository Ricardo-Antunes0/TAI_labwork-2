Khavaran cemetery (Persian: گورستان خاوران) is an old cemetery in Tehran, Iran. The cemetery is located in the northwest of Tehran, on the outskirts of the Khavaran neighborhood, and has an area of about 1.5 hectares.  The cemetery was founded in 1748 by Mirza Asad-al-Din Mohammad Khavaran, a high-ranking official in the Safavid dynasty and a member of the Qajar dynasty. The cemetery originally consisted of two parts: a formal part for aristocrats and religious leaders, and an informal part for commoners. The cemetery was used until the 1990s as a dumping ground for corpses from hospitals and funeral parlors. In 1997, the Iranian government began efforts to clean and restore the cemetery. Today, it is used primarily for burial of members of the Zoroastrian community.

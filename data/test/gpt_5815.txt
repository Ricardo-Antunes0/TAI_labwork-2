Drug–impaired driving, in the context of its legal definition, is driving under the influence of a drug or drugs to a degree that impairs one's ability to operate a motor vehicle safely.  Drugs that can impair driving include alcohol, marijuana, opioids, and other psychoactive substances. They can be legal or illegal, prescription or recreational. They can be used in small amounts or in large amounts.  Drug–impaired driving is a major public health problem in Canada and the United States. In 2015, more than half a million Canadians were involved in collisions that involved a drug–impaired driver. In the United States, there were over 100,000 drug–impaired driving incidents in 2014, resulting in over 35,000 injuries and over 500 deaths.

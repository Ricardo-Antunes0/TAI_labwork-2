A ballcock (also balltap or float valve) is a type of valve used for controlling the flow of fluid in pipes, tanks, and other systems. The valve is a type of check valve, and works by admitting fluid only when the pressure inside the system is greater than the atmospheric pressure outside the system.   The ballcock was invented in 1799 by Benjamin Franklin, and is named after him.

was a Japanese anarchist, social critic, author, journalist, and philosopher.  Noe Itō was born in 1871 into an impoverished samurai family in what is now the city of Ōita, Ōita Prefecture. He became radicalized after reading anarchist works by Émile Armand and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and soon began to write articles and pamphlets critical of the government and social order. In 1903, he co-founded the leftist newspaper "Sankei Shinbun" with others, and served as its editor until 1918.   Itō's radical ideas led to several prosecutions and imprisonments in the Meiji and Taishō periods. He died in 1938.

President's House is a historic house at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The first president of the University Corporation was John Eliot, and the house was built for him in 1837â€“38. It served as the Harvard residence of the presidents of the University Corporation until 1909, when it was replaced by Cabot House. The house is now used for administrative offices.  The President's House is a two-story brick building with a hipped roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade has a three-story portico supported by six Ionic columns, with a balustrade and square steps leading up to a double door. The interior features many elaborate woodwork and plaster details, including carved mantelpieces and ceiling panels embellished with scrolling foliage.

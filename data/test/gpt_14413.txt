Acacia cupularis, commonly known as the Coastal REDWOOD, is a tree found in coastal regions of California and Oregon. The tree typically grows to a height of about 30 m (98 ft), with a trunk diameter of up to 2 m (6.6 ft). The bark is rough and scaly, and the leaves are elliptical, measuring up to 25 cm (10 in) long and 15 cm (6 in) wide. The flowers are white or pink, and the fruits are round, leathery capsules measuring up to 15 cm (6 in) in diameter.  The Coastal REDWOOD is the largest tree in the world that grows naturally on land. It is also one of the oldest living trees, with some specimens estimated to be over 3,000 years old. The tree is vulnerable to fire, and has been logged extensively over the years. However, the tree is now protected by law, and there are efforts underway to restore populations of the Coastal REDWOODs along the coast.

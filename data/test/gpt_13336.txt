Tide gauge measurements show that the current rate of sea level rise is about 3 mm/year, which is about a tenth of the rate predicted by the IPCC for the end of this century.     The IPCC predicts that sea level will rise by about 20 cm by the end of the century due to thermal expansion and melting of glaciers and ice sheets. This would inundate low-lying coastal areas and displaces millions of people.     Estimates of future sea level rise are controversial because different models produce very different predictions. If recent trends continue, sea level could rise by as much as 1 meter by 2100, causing significant coastal flooding and loss of property value.

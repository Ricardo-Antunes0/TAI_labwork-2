Chronic superficial keratitis (CSK), also known as pannus or Uberreiter's disease, is an inflammatory condition of the cornea in dogs, particularly seen in the German Shepherd. Both eyes are usually affected. The corneas gradually become pigmented and  infiltrated by blood vessels, and the dog may eventually become blind. Signs and symptoms CSK is usually a bilateral progressive condition, however the lesions are not symmetrical nor are they painful.  Signs include pigmentation and vascularization of the cornea (extension of blood vessels onto the cornea).  It is usually first seen at the lateral (temporal) limbus (the junction between the cornea and sclera), although it eventually can extend from any part of the limbus to cover the entire cornea.  Severe cases can cause blindness.  Although CSK is usually identifiable by the appearance of the eye and the breed of the affected dog, cytology will reveal the presence of lymphocytes and plasma cells.

The Eurail Pass, introduced in 1959 and now in its 59th year of operation, is the world's most popular intercity rail pass. It enables travelers to use any train in Europe for a period of up to five months, with no blackout dates. The Eurail Pass also covers a variety of optional activities, such as touring, short trips and specific trains.  Eurail began as a socialist project to connect Europeans through rail travel. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Eurail became a symbol of international cooperation and friendship. Today, the Eurail Pass offers a unique opportunity for travelers to explore Europe by train at their own pace and without having to worry about ticket prices or reservations.

High-frequency direction finding, usually known by its acronym HFDF, is a method of locating a target using radio waves. HFDF employs very shortwave frequencies, typically between 3 kHz and 30 kHz. This allows targets located in the near-field to be detected with greater accuracy than with longwave frequencies.  HFDF was first developed during World War I as a way to locate enemy artillery. Since then, it has been used in a variety of applications, including air traffic control, military intelligence, and search and rescue. Today, HFDF is still an important tool in many fields.

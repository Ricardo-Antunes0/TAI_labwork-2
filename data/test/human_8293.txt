The Cisrhenian Republic  was a client state (sister republic) of the French Revolutionary Wars. It was proclaimed in 1797 on the Left Bank of the Rhine under French occupation. History At the beginning of the War of the First Coalition, in 1792, French revolutionary troops conquered the Palatinate region and occupied the cities of Mainz, Speyer, and Worms. They terminated the centuries-long reign of the local nobility and clergy, which met with approval among broad sections of the public. A German Jacobin Club was established at Mainz in October to promote the export of revolution in the lands of the Holy Roman Empire together with the occupying forces. The short-lived Republic of Mainz, established in March 1793, was the first attempt to implement a democratic state on current German territory. The Republic ended after Prussian and Austrian coalition troops started the Siege of Mainz and forced the surrender of the city.

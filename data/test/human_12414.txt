Uthman ibn al-Huwayrith  was an Arab of the Quraysh who converted to Christianity. After revolting against idol worship in Mecca in favor of monotheism during the late 6th century, he sought assistance from the Byzantine Empire in 590 in a ploy to install himself as king of Mecca. While in Byzantium, he converted to Christianity. He is also known for having compiled poetic works. Biography Uthman was born into the clan of Asad ibn Abd-al-Uzza who belonged to the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. He converted to monotheism while he was young â€“ during a religious feast held by the Quraysh in celebration of their sacrifices made to the idol, Uthman and three of his relatives entered into a secret oath in which they agreed to renounce idol worship in favor of the Abrahamic religions. They based their decision on the belief that idol worship had no textual or spiritual basis.

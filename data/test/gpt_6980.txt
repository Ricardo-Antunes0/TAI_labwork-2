Aspet (, , Aspetes in contemporary Greek) is a small town in the Pella regional unit, Central Macedonia, Greece. It is located on the river Asopos, 10 km north of Pella. Aspet is known for its mineral springs.   The town of Aspet was founded by the refugees from the village of Aspendos, which had been destroyed by the Turks in 1821. The name Aspet is derived from the ancient Macedonian word "aspet" meaning "a fountain or a place where water flows abundantly".   The first thermal springs were discovered in Aspet in 1760 by a soldier of the Hellenic Army and were named "Kallikrates" after the Greek general and patriot Kallikrates (1723-1779). In 1821, a settlement was founded near the thermal springs by refugees from Aspendos. The settlement was named "Aspendos" after the village that had been destroyed, but this name was changed to "Aspet" in 1824. In 1893, a new settlement was founded on the opposite bank of the river Asopos and named "Koritsa". The two settlements united in 1928 to form the present-day town of Aspet.

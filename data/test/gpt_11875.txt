Hermann Kant (; 14 June 1926 – 6 January 2015) was a German philosopher and mathematician. He is best known for his work in philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of science.  Born in Berlin, Kant attended the University of Berlin and then the University of Freiburg, where he received his doctorate in 1954. He then taught at the universities of Marburg and Tubingen, before taking up a chair at the University of Konstanz in 1976. In 1991 he moved to the University of Tübingen, where he remained until his retirement in 2001.  Kant's philosophical work centres on issues in ontology, epistemology, and philosophy of science. His most famous works are "Critique of Pure Reason" (1781), "Phenomenology of Spirit" (1807), and "The Critique of Practical Reason" (1788).

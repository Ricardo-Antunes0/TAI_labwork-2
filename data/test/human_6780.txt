The Zebra was a three-masted ship, built in 1818.  On 12 August 1838, Zebra, Dirk Meinerts Hahn, master, departed from Altona, Hamburg on a voyage to Port Misery, South Australia. The ship arrived at its destination on 28 December 1838. On board was a crew of 16 and 188 passengers with their belongings. In addition, the ship carried 100 barrels of pork, 100 barrels of flour, 65 barrels of fresh water, 17 hogsheads of beer and vinegar, 14 barrels of herrings, two boxes of boots and 40,924 bricks. Two passengers died before the journey began. Furthermore, some passengers were on board several weeks prior to departure, leading to an additional two that perished before reaching open sea. For the time, a relatively low number of passengers, 12, died during the journey at sea. This brought the number of passengers down from 199 leaving Germany to 188 arriving in Adelaide. The last corpse was buried at sea as Zebra was approaching Kangaroo Island. Due to a low tide, the passengers could not disembark until 2 January 1839.

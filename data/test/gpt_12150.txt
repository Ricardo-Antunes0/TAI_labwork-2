Hutchinson's pupil is a clinical sign in which a person's pupil becomes smaller in size due to dilation of the pupil due to a foreign body or disease.  Hutchinson's pupils are named after the British physician and anatomist James Hutchinson (1733-1802). They are most commonly seen in children and can be a sign of various conditions, such as conjunctivitis, meningitis, and glaucoma.

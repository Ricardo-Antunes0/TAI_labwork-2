Magora Elmira Kennedy (born Magora Ernestine Molineaux; September 22, 1938) is an American minister and LGBT civil rights activist who participated in the Stonewall uprising. She is a former Black Panther and was involved in the civil rights and women’s rights movements. She is a self-proclaimed Black lesbian, crone goddess, and woman of God. Early life  Magora Kennedy was born on September 22, 1938 in Albany, New York and raised in Saratoga Springs, New York. Her father was White and Caribbean and her mother was Native American and Black. Kennedy knew that she was a lesbian from a young age. At age 14, she was outed and, in an attempt to “cure” her homosexuality, her mother offered her the choice of marrying a man, or be institutionalized at the Utica State Hospital. She ended up marrying a man 21 years her senior. The marriage was consummated, but later annulled because of her age. She later married a gay man, before divorcing him and publicly coming out as a lesbian. Kennedy's second husband was bisexual. On the LGBTQ&A podcast, she said, "He was in the army and he was a paratrooper. He was bisexual, so if he got discovered he was going to get kicked out of the army. I said, 'Not a problem. We can just get married.' They used to have the saying 'cover girl', 'cover boy'. And that was the way people that were gay...that's what they did."

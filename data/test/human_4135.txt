100% Cinta Indonesia (Indonesian: "100% Love Indonesia") is a campaign launched in 2009 to promote Indonesian brands and products. Although the campaign was initially meant as a consumer awareness program to promote Indonesian products and brands, the campaign has transformed into social movement to appreciate and love everything Indonesian, not just brands and products but also foods, arts, crafts, traditional and popular culture, and many aspects of Indonesia. History The campaign was initiated in 2009 by Ministry of Trade and Ministry of Communication and Information of the Republic of Indonesia to change the perception and mindset of Indonesian people that Indonesian products have lesser quality than imported ones.

According to the President, the campaign objective is to increase appreciation and nurture pride in using Indonesian products. Indonesian brands, products, and services were encouraged to put the ”100% Cinta Indonesia” logo on their product packages and promotion materials. The logo is free for Indonesian companies to use.

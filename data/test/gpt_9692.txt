The Grand Mosque seizure occurred during November 2008, when a number of gunmen entered the mosque during Friday prayers and took hostages. The gunmen, believed to be members of the Al-Qaeda-linked Abu Sayyaf militant group, demanded the release of several prisoners, including Malaysian national Myuran Sukumaran.   The siege ended after a six-hour standoff in which Philippine forces repelled the militants, killing all but one of them. At least 145 people were killed in the incident, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in the Philippines since the turn of the 21st century.

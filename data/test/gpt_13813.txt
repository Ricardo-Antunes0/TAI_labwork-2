ACES II is an ejection seat system for fighter aircraft. It was developed by Airbus Defence and Space and is now manufactured by Airbus Helicopters.  The ACES II system is a dual-purpose system that can be used for both ejection and landing. It is a modular system, and can be configured for a variety of aircraft types. The system consists of two parts: the ACES II seat and the ACES II support unit.  The ACES II seat is a lightweight, comfortable seat that uses advanced technologies to ensure safe and secure ejection. The seat has a range of capabilities that allow it to be fitted to a wide range of aircraft. The support unit provides the necessary support for the ACES II seat during flight, and can be configured to provide different levels of support.

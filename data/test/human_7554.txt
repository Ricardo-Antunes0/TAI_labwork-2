"Optimistique-moi" (English: "Optimistic Me") is a 1999 song recorded by the French artist Myl√®ne Farmer. The fourth single from her fifth studio album, Innamoramento, it was released on 22 February 2000. Dealing with parental relationships, the song enjoyed many remixes and formats and achieved success in France where it reached number seven. Background and writing The song was one of the most anticipated singles by Farmer's fans, mostly because it was the first one to be fully composed, i.e. lyrics and music, by the singer. A promotional envelope, limited to 150 copies, was sent to radio stations, but several of them were stolen within the recording company, generating a judicial inquiry. As consequence, the release on radio originally scheduled for 4 January 2000 was delayed to 11 January. A new promotional format, a white CD single, was sent in turn to radio stations. The release of the formats was made in two times : first, the CD single and a CD maxi on 22 February 2000, then another CD maxi and the vinyl on 7 March. Unlike her previous singles, "Optimistique-moi" was released under two different digipacks for the remixes, which certainly helped to increase the single's sales (nine years later, "C'est dans l'air" had also two CD maxi). For the first time in the singer's career, the song was remixed in the U.S. where it was released in underground clubs, with only the words "MF", which allowed the artist's name to remain undisclosed; however, these remixes were also available in France. Regularly aired on radio in the single version, but also in the 'opti-mystic radio mix' on Europe 2, the song also enjoyed commercial ads on television (since 23 February on M6), and radios (since 18 February on NRJ).

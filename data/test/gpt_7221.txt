"Bin Sangyeo Nori" refers to performances by Buddhist monks in Korea. The monks usually wear bright colors, sing traditional Buddhist hymns, and perform acrobatic movements while seated on a raised platform.  The origin of bin sangyeo nori can be traced back to the Goryeo period. At that time, Buddhist monks traveled throughout the country and performed their religious ceremonies. This type of performance became known as bin sangyeo nori.  During the Joseon period, bin sangyeo nori underwent a transformation. The monks began to specialize in certain areas, such as music and dance. In addition, they began to use more elaborate costumes and perform more elaborate dances.  Today, bin sangyeo nori is a popular performance art form in Korea. It is seen as a way to promote Buddhism and celebrate the country's cultural heritage.

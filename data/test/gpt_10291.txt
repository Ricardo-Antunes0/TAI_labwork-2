Abu Mustafa al-Sheibani (born 1959 in al-Nasiriyah) is an Iraqi Sunni Muslim cleric who is currently the head of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI).  Al-Sheibani studied Islamic jurisprudence at al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. He returned to Iraq in 1987 and began preaching at mosques in Baghdad and Mosul. In 1992, he founded the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI), which has been described as a "moderate" Islamist organisation.  In 2006, he was elected as ISCI's president. He has been criticised by some Sunni Muslims for his close ties to Shia Iran and for his support of the Iraqi government during the 2007â€“2008 Sunni insurgency.

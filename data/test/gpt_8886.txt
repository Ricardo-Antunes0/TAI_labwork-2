In economics, a budget constraint represents all the constraints that a person or organization faces in trying to allocate limited resources in a way that satisfies all their preferences.  A budget constraint can arise when people have to make choices between various types of spending, such as between spending money on food, clothes, housing, or entertainment. For example, imagine a person who has $100 to spend on groceries this week and wants to buy the most expensive items on the list. If the person has a budget constraint, they may have to choose between buying groceries and buying clothes.  Similarly, an organization may face a budget constraint when trying to spend money on projects or activities. For example, a company may have to choose between hiring new employees or investing in new technology.

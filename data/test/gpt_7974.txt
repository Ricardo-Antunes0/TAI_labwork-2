"Oui mais... non" (English: "Yes But... No") is a French political slogan used to oppose the Yes campaign in the French referendum on the constitutional reform of 2005. The slogan was created by Philippe Pétain, the father of Marshal Philippe Pétain, after his son said no to signing the armistice with Germany in 1940.  The slogan was first used by opponents of the proposed constitutional reform, which would have granted more power to the French president. They used it to argue that granting too much power to one person would lead to dictatorship. The slogan became associated with opposition to the proposed constitutional reform after Jacques Chirac, then the Prime Minister, said that "oui, mais... non" meant "yes but no".  The slogan has been used in various forms since its creation. In 2005, supporters of the proposed constitutional reform used a variation of the slogan, "oui et je vote" (English: "yes and I vote").

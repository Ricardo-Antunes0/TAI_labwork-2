The World Indigenous Games is a multisport event, which involves over 2,000 indigenous athletes competing against one another. These athletes come from all across the world to unite and compete fairly in this event (approximately 30 countries) (2015). Throughout the first three days athletes mingle and bond in their area of sport/games before entering the ten-day competition. The Games are governed by the Inter Tribal Council, a Brazilian indigenous peoples NGO that has staged Brazil's national Indigenous Games since 1996. The first edition of the Games was held in Palmas, Brazil, from October 23 to November 1, 2015, while the second (and most recent) was hosted by Alberta, Canada in 2017. The Games are expected to be held intermittently thereafter, and will feature competitive sports and non-competitive demonstration events. Throughout history, indigenous peoples have had many traditional sports and dances. It is through their history that they have turned these into competitive games and have made it an influential impact on the world and their people's culture. These games consist of body paint replacing sportswear, bare feet instead of sneakers and a looser conception of competition that comes with little value to winning. The WIN Games are a multisport event structured similar to the Olympics, but with the addition of traditional Indigenous events. The main idea of the games is to focus on reconciliation and the notion that “everyone is welcomed”, exemplified when a group of Syrian refugees were allowed to form a soccer team and compete in the Canada WIN Games. International sporting events have become a means to project positive images and garner social, political, and/or economic benefits for their communities. Organizers and indigenous stakeholders wanted to use the WIN Games to address challenges faced by Indigenous communities such as: stereotypes, lack of resources and opportunities for Indigenous youth, and vulnerability of Indigenous women.

"Lift Yourself" is a song by American rapper Kanye West. West wrote the song alongside James Massie and Ben Winters, and produced it with additional production from Mike Dean. The song was debuted on April 27, 2018, through West's website and was released by GOOD Music and Def Jam three days later for digital download and streaming as a standalone single. The first release of new music from West since his seventh studio album, The Life of Pablo (2016), it was perceived by numerous fans and publications to be him trolling them. The song is an avant-garde track that samples Amnesty's "Liberty" and Dancer's "Boom Boom". Following a long build-up, West scats towards the end of the song, rapping nonsensical words. "Lift Yourself" received mixed to negative reviews from music critics, many of whom panned the lyrics and dismissed the song for lacking seriousness. Some praised the production, while a few critics expressed more positive feelings towards West's troll performance. The song peaked at number two on the US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart, while also appearing on charts in Ireland, New Zealand, and Sweden. West and the Sunday Service Choir performed it live on multiple occasions in 2019, including a performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Smokepurpp released his remix of the song in April 2018, which West approved of. The following month, Pusha T confirmed the existence of a version of the song that has proper lyrics but has not yet been released.

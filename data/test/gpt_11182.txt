Indian Summer (Polish: Babie lato) is an 1884 oil painting by Polish artist Józef Pacholski. It is considered one of the most popular paintings in the history of Polish art.  The painting is a summer landscape with a palazzo located in the centre, surrounded by vineyards and olive trees. The painting is often compared to other works of the same period by artists such as Vincent van Gogh and Claude Monet.  The painting was commissioned by Count Władysław Zamoyski, an admirer of Pacholski's earlier work, for his villa in Radom. Completed in 1884, it was first exhibited at the Paris Salon in the same year. It has been exhibited at many venues around the world, including the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in London.  The painting has been described as "one of the most popular paintings in the history of Polish art" and "one of Poland's finest works of art".

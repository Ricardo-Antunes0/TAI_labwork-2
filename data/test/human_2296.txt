Georg Schreyögg (13 August 1870 – 7 July 1934) was a German sculptor. One of his better known surviving works is the 1907 St Barbara War Memorial in Koblenz, taken down to make way for a new road in 1956 but returned to a site in the city close to its original location in 2014. Life Georg Schreyögg was born in Aitrang, a village in the Alpine foothills near Kempten.   He grew up in Mittenwald, however, a small but prosperous transit town southeast of Partenkirchen, along the mountain road towards the Brenner Pass and, beyond that, Lombardy.   Mittenwald was (and is) a town with a long craft tradition of wood carving and violin making.   Georg was the youngest son of the five recorded children born to Mathäus Schreyögg (1831–?), identified variously as an inn keeper and a master baker, and his wife, born Kreszentia Marie Jörg (1833–1899).

Cottonwood Island, a large island in the middle of the Humboldt River, is located in the Nevada portion of the Great Basin. The island is about 12 miles long and 6 miles wide and has an area of about 7 square miles. The island is home to about 50 residents, most of whom are descendants of the Mormon pioneers who settled there in the mid-19th century.  The island is divided into two parts by a narrow channel called Cottonwood Creek. The eastern part of the island is mainly flat, while the western part is hilly and has several small mesas. The highest point on the island is about 875 feet above sea level. The climate on Cottonwood Island is arid, with an average annual rainfall of only about 12 inches.  The primary economic activity on Cottonwood Island is cattle ranching. There are also a few fishermen and farmers who raise crops such as wheat, barley, and corn. There is also a small commercial fishing operation located on the island.  Cottonwood Island was first explored by Mormon pioneers in 1857. At that time, it was uninhabited and served as a staging area for expeditions into the Great Basin. In 1863, Mormon settlers established a community on the island and named it Brigham City after their leader, Brigham Young. The settlement grew rapidly and by 1868 had a population of more than 1,000 people. However, Brigham City was destroyed by a flood in 1871 and the inhabitants were forced to abandon the island.

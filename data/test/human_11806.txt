The 1139 Ganja earthquake is one of the worst seismic events in history. It affected the Seljuk Empire and Kingdom of Georgia; modern-day Azerbaijan and Georgia. The earthquake had an estimated moment magnitude of 7.0 or greater and 7.7 on the surface wave magnitude scale. A maximum intensity of IX (Violent) to XI (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale was assigned to this earthquake. The strong shaking triggered massive landslides off the sides of mountains and canyons in the Caucasus Mountains region. Parts of Kapaz Mount collapsed, with the resulting landslide blocking the Kürəkçay River, forming the  lake Göygöl. It was also perceived as far as Aleppo where the felt intensity was II. The estimated death toll from this earthquake is somewhere between 230,000 and 300,000 making it one of the deadliest earthquakes in history. The death toll remains controversial with some authors stating that it is an exaggeration considering the population of the area at the time of the disaster, or that this was a conflation with the 1138 Aleppo and 1137 Jazira earthquakes. Mkhitar Gosh, an Armenian scholar and writer, quoted Job 9:6 and Psalm 103:32 from the Holy Bible to describe the earthquake. He described tremendous damage in the P'ar'isos and Xach'e'n districts of Syunik. The city of Ganzak also suffered devastation, leaving many of the townspeople buried under ruins. Many structures including monasteries and churches castles and villages in the mountainous region were totally destroyed. The number of people who died in the mountains is not known, described as "incalculable".

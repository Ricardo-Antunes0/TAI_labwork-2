A jurat (short for Latin , "itinerant judge") is a type of concession in English law, conferring jurisdiction on a person or body other than the court itself. Jurats may be created by statute, or by custom and usage.  A jurat is not a judge and does not have the full powers of a judge. A jurat is instead a person appointed by the court to conduct an inquiry or make a decision in lieu of a full-time judge. A jurat's jurisdiction may be limited to particular matters or areas, or it may be general. Jurats may be appointed for short periods of time, or they may continue to hold office indefinitely.   The appointment of jurats is often used in administrative law and family law.

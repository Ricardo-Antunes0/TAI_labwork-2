Netley Abbey is a ruined late medieval abbey in Hampshire, England. It is now a tourist attraction.  The abbey was founded in the late 11th century by Waltheof, Earl of Northampton, on land granted to him by King Henry I. The abbey was sacked and burned by the Normans in 1087, but was rebuilt and enlarged over the following centuries. In 1336 Edward III founded a new college at Netley, making it one of the most important religious houses in England. The abbey declined in importance after the Reformation, but was restored in the 18th century and used as a college for Benedictine monks. The abbey was damaged by fire in 1881 and ceased to be an active monastery in 1908. It is now a tourist attraction open to the public.

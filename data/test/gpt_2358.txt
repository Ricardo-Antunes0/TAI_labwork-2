The name deer botfly (also deer nose botfly) is given to a species of fly in the family Culicidae. This fly is a major carrier of the blacklegged fever virus (BLV). The distribution of the deer botfly is restricted to North America. The deer botfly lives in temperate and subarctic regions of eastern and central North America, as well as parts of Eurasia.  The deer botfly is a small, dark-colored fly about 3/8 inch long. It has a conspicuous white band across its abdomen. The male has large, protruding eyes and a long proboscis. The female is smaller and has smaller eyes and a shorter proboscis.  The deer botfly is the primary vector for the blacklegged fever virus (BLV). BLV is a highly contagious disease that can cause severe illness in humans. The deer botfly spreads BLV by laying eggs on the skin of mammals, including humans. When the eggs hatch, the larvae feed on the skin, eventually burrowing into the flesh.

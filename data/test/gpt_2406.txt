In high-energy physics, the Landau–Pomeranchuk–Migdal effect, also known as the LPM effect, is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which the energy of a particle is reduced when it passes through a material with an index of refraction different from that of the particle.  The Landau–Pomeranchuk–Migdal effect was first observed in 1956 by Lev Landau, Vitaly Pomeranchuk, and Iosif Migdal. The effect can occur when a particle, such as an electron, travels through a material with a higher index of refraction than the material from which it originated. This causes the energy of the electron to be reduced because its speed is no longer in agreement with the laws of quantum mechanics.

Yeshiva Ohel Torah-Baranovich, commonly referred to as the Baranovich Yeshiva or simply as Baranovich, was an Orthodox Jewish yeshiva in Baranavichy, Belarus (which at its founding was ruled by the Russian Empire and after World War I, the Second Polish Republic). Established circa 1906 by Rabbi Yosef Yoizel Horowitz, the Alter of Novardok (Navahrudak), it attracted leading rabbis such as Rabbi Yisroel Yaakov Lubchansky and Rabbi Avraham Yoffen as instructors, but was forced to disband with the outbreak of World War I. After the war, Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman, a student of the Radin Yeshiva who had been forced into exile in Smilaviƒçy during the hostilities, agreed to serve as rosh yeshiva (dean) upon the recommendation of the Chofetz Chaim. In the interwar period, the yeshiva gained widespread fame and a large student body. Wasserman's style of teaching emphasized the simple meaning of the Talmudic texts and students advanced to the point that they were able to study independently. The yeshiva went into exile and disbanded a second time during World War II, and Wasserman and many of the students were murdered by Lithuanian Nazi sympathizers. Torah institutions named after the Baranovich Yeshiva and Wasserman were later established in the United States and Israel. Founding  The yeshiva was founded circa 1906 by Rabbi Yosef Yoizel Horowitz, known as the Alter of Novardok, who was establishing mussar yeshivas throughout Russia.  Horowitz's daughter, Feiga Malka, was married to Rabbi Yisroel Yaakov Lubchansky, son of Rabbi Chaim Leib Lubchansky of Baranovich, so he turned his attention to strengthening Torah study in this city. Horowitz also motivated Rabbi Chaikel Sofer, an influential Jew living in the city, to supply room and board for the student body, and brought in several rabbis to teach in his yeshiva. In 1914, he introduced his son-in-law, Rabbi Avraham Yoffen, as a lecturer. However, at the end of that year, World War I broke out and the yeshiva was disbanded.

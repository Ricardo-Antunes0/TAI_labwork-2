Forest Haven was a live-in facility for developmentally delayed adults in upstate New York. It was founded in 1971 by Dr. Benjamin Spock and his wife, Mary.  Forest Haven was the first of its kind in the United States, and it played an important role in the development of residential care for adults with developmental disabilities. The facility was located on a 192-acre (7.4 kmÂ²) campus in Hampton Bays, New York, and it served as a model for later residential care facilities for developmentally delayed adults.  In 2003, Forest Haven ceased operations due to financial difficulties. The property has since been sold and is now a private residence.

Rodney Ewing is an interdisciplinary artist in San Francisco, California. Ewing's work explores identity, narrative, history, space, displacement, physical vulnerability and violence. Ewing's work involves extensive subject research. Often Ewing uses once-common, but now little-known historical objects. He also uses first person narratives. Ewing's art explores and translates the literal and emotional dimensions of these subjects. Along with historical images of artifacts and victims of violence, Ewing often layers in quotations by different writers. Reading these quotations, sometimes obscured by the visual elements of the piece, creates another experience that is unique and nuanced within the context of the print, sculpture or installation. He employs different methods to draw the viewer in, literally and figuratively, toward the piece and immerses the viewer in a reorienting experience of images, words and ideas. Ewing's work has referenced James Baldwin, Henry Box Brown, Colson Whitehead, George Stinney, Charles Moore, the San Francisco Redevelopment after Japanese Internment, Ralph Ellison, Petrus Camper and Saul Williams.

Flekkerøy or Flekkerøya is an island and municipality in Hordaland county, Norway. The municipality is located in the Hardangerfjorden and it has a population of 8,191. The island is the largest and most populous island in the municipality. The municipality encompasses both the island of Flekkerøy and several small surrounding islands.  Flekkerøy is one of the oldest municipalities in Norway. It was founded as a rural municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1874, the rural municipality of Flekkerøy was divided into the urban municipalities of Bergen and Flekkerøy. The island of Flekkerøy was then separated from Bergen and made an independent municipality.  The municipality is named after the island of Flekkerøy. The name is probably derived from Old Norse "flækr" meaning "a flag" and "øy" meaning "island".

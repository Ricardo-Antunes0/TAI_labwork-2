Central City Opera is the fifth-oldest opera company in the United States. It was founded in 1928 by the composer and conductor Karl Muck, who served as the company's first artistic director.  Central City Opera is a resident company at the Fox Theatre in downtown St. Louis. The company's presenting season runs from late February to early November. The opera house has a seating capacity of 1,704 people and has been used for performances of both classical and popular operas.  The company's repertoire ranges from baroque to modern operas, and includes works by such composers as Antonio Vivaldi, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Rossini, Donizetti, Verdi, Puccini, and Bizet. In recent years, the company has made a significant effort to commission new works from American composers.  Central City Opera is supported by the St. Louis Regional Arts Board and is an affiliate of the Metropolitan Opera Association.

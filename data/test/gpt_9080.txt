R v Carto is an important case in Canadian criminal law, decided by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1991. The case involved a First Nations man, R. v. Carto, who was charged with possession of explosives with the intent to endanger life.  CARTO was arrested after he drove his truck up to a nearby police checkpoint and deliberately detonated a device hidden in the vehicle, injuring two officers. The charge against him was based on the explosives possession statute – which at the time carried a maximum sentence of life imprisonment – rather than the more serious indictable offence of attempted murder.  The defence argued that CARTO had no intention of harming anyone, and that the explosives were merely intended for ceremonial purposes. The court ultimately found CARTO not guilty on the grounds that he had not intended to endanger life, and his possession of explosives did not constitute a crime under Canadian law.

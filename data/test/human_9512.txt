"Amaze Me" is a song performed by all-female German pop group No Angels. It was written by British songwriters Steve Mac and Karen Poole, and produced by Boogieman and Roland Spremberg for the band's comeback album, their fourth full-length studio album Destiny (2007). Musically, the song is a pulsating hymn-like pop ballad. Lyrically, "Amaze Me" is an ode to love. Still amazed by her lover, the female protagonist sings that she feels happy their relationship has lasted through good and bad times over the years. Released to positive reviews by music critics, the song was released as the album's third single as a double A-single along with the Womack & Womack cover "Teardrops" on 19 October 2007 in German-speaking Europe. The song reached number 25 on the German Singles Chart, but failed to enter the national charts elsewhere, eventually becoming one of the group's lowest-charting singles. Slightly more successful than its predecessor "Maybe" however, it managed to reach the composite Billboard Eurochart Hot 100 Singles chart. In 2013, English boy band Union J recorded a cover of the song for their self-titled debut album.

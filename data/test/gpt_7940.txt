A penetration test, colloquially known as a pentest, is a type of security audit conducted to evaluate the security of a computer system. It uses techniques such as reconnaissance and software testing to identify vulnerabilities.  A penetration test is not a vulnerability assessment, nor is it a test of the security features of a system. Penetration tests are designed to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications. This information can then be used to compromise the security of the target system or application.

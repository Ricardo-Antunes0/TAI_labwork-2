Maciej Lewenstein (born September 21, 1955 in Warsaw), is a Polish theoretical physicist, currently an ICREA professor at ICFO – The Institute of Photonic Sciences in Castelldefels near Barcelona. He is an author of over 480 scientific articles and 2 books, and recipient of many international and national prizes. In addition to quantum physics his other passion is music, and jazz in particular. His collection of compact discs and vinyl records includes over 9000 items. Education Maciej Lewenstein was born on 21.09.1955. He graduated at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at Warsaw University in 1978, with his diploma thesis about the superradiance phenomenon written under the supervision of Prof. . After one year of working as a scientific assistant at the ITP of Warsaw University, he joined in 1979 the new Centre for Theoretical Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw (CFT), newly formed by Prof. I. Białynicki-Birula. At CFT he started his PhD studies on applications of functional integration methods in quantum optics with Prof. K. Rzążewski. In 1981 he became a DAAD stipend holder at the Essen University. There, he completed his thesis under the joint supervision of Prof. F. Haake in 1983 with summa cum laude and the Prize of the University. In the years 1984-1986 he spent long term visits as a postdoc at  Essen University with Prof. F. Haake working on statistical physics of disordered systems. After returning to Poland and becoming a faculty member of the CFT, he habilitated in 1986 at the Institute of Physics in Warsaw. Lewenstein's habilitation concerned cavity quantum electrodynamics and intense laser-matter interactions.

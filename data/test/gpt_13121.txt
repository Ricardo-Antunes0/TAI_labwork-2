Jain meditation (dhyāna) has been the central practice of the Jain religion since its inception. Jain meditation is an analytical and reflective practice that seeks to achieve a state of inner peace and liberation.  The aim of Jain meditation is to achieve "samyak dhyāna", or "perfect unbroken concentration" on an object of contemplation, which leads to "samyak jñāna", or "perfect knowledge". The practice is typically undertaken in a secluded spot in order to focus the mind on an inner sense of "dharma" (the universal principle of righteousness) or "paramārtha" (the highest ideal).  The origins of Jain meditation are unclear, but it likely originated in the 6th century BC. By the 4th century AD, Jain monks had developed a sophisticated form of meditation known as "samādhi". This involved focusing the mind on a single object for extended periods of time in order to achieve a state of inner peace and clarity.  Today, Jain meditation is practiced by both lay people and monks throughout India. It is also popular in countries such as Nepal, Bhutan, and Thailand.

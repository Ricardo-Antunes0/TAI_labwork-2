Al Bahathri (15 March 1982 â€“ 7 May 2014) was an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. As a two-year-old she was one of the best of her generation in Europe, winning three of her five races including the Princess Margaret Stakes and the Lowther Stakes. In the following year she was narrowly beaten in the 1000 Guineas before winning the Irish 1,000 Guineas, Coronation Stakes and Child Stakes. After her retirement from racing she became a very successful and influential broodmare, whose descendants included Haafhd, Military Attack, Gladiatorus and Red Cadeaux. She died in 2014 at the age of thirty-two. Background Al Bahathri was a chestnut mare with a white blaze, three white feet and a long white sock on her left hind leg bred in Kentucky by Thomas P. Whitney. She was from the fifth crop of foals sired by the French-bred stallion Blushing Groom who sired numerous other major winners including Rainbow Quest, Nashwan and Arazi. Al Bahathri's dam Chain Store, was a successful racemare who won eight races before being retired to the breeding shed, where she also produced the Diana Handicap winner Geraldine's Store. Chain Store was a full sister to Double Discount, a gelding who set a world record time of 1:57.4 for ten furlongs on turf when winning the Carleton F. Burke Handicap in 1977. Al Bahathri was described as a "well-made filly... a good mover with a fine long stride".

It was designed by Thomas Peebles and built from 1899 to 1900.  The Gee Gee Bridge was built as part of the Bulimba Reach development project in 1898-99 by Thomas Peebles and Company. The bridge was named after Gee Gee, a Aboriginal boy who died after being swept away in a river flood caused by heavy rainfall.  The Bulimba Reach development project was one of the earliest large-scale schemes in Brisbane, and it included a number of significant bridges across the Brisbane River. The Gee Gee Bridge is one of two bridges that still remain from the project; the other is the Stanley Street Bridge (now demolished). The Bulimba Reach development also included other major public works, such as the Queens Park Oval cricket ground and the railway station at Bulimba.  The Gee Gee Bridge has been preserved as a heritage-listed structure and continues to function as a road bridge today. It is one of the few surviving examples of Edwardian engineering in Brisbane, and it is an important part of Brisbane's history.

The Ostedijk is a Dutch cargo ship that was built in 1955 by the Koninklijke Maatschappij De Schelde, Vlissingen.   The Ostedijk was originally built as a cargo ship, to transport coal and other goods across the world. However, she has since been used for a variety of other purposes, including transporting passengers and cargo between different ports. The Ostedijk is currently owned and operated by the Koninklijke Nederlandsche Lloyd.

Cedric Constantine Myton (born 1947) is a Jamaican Rastafari reggae musician who was a founding member of the roots reggae band The Congos. Career Myton was born in Old Harbour, Jamaica. He began his singing career with the group The Bell Stars, who recorded one single 45" "over and over" (1967), which was a minor success. Alongside Lincoln Thompson, "preps" Lewis, and Devon Russell, Myton formed The Tartans in 1968, the group released many 45" singles, and had early success in 1969 with the hit 45 "Dance All Night". After a couple of years The Tartans disbanded, and Myton alongside Lincoln "Prince" Thompson, formed "The Royal Rasses". Myton spent almost 3 years alongside Thompson, writing the tracks which would constitute the Royal Rasses album Humanity. Myton also sang on every track on Humanity. This album was a big success, although Myton left The Royal Rasses shortly after the release of Humanity. The band continued without Myton, who went on to form The Congos, alongside Roydel Johnson, who had a rich "tenor" and Watty Burnett who provided a "Deep Barritone", which combined with Myton's rich "Falsetto" anchored The Congos.

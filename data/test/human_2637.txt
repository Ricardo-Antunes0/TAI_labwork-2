The Somerville Journal is a weekly newspaper published in Somerville, Massachusetts. Nineteenth century Its first issue was published December 8, 1870, by W. A. Greenough & Co., known for publishing directories. During the next few years the paper changed ownership several times, early owners including Russell Conwell, then a Somerville resident, and John A. Cummings, later mayor of the city. On October 20, 1876, the paper came into the control of the Somerville Journal Company, under the presidency of J. O. Hayden. Hayden later became president of two Somerville banks, and treasurer of Middlesex County. With the change of ownership, the paper, which had previously been printed in Boston, began to be printed in Somerville, first in an office on the third floor of the Hill Building in Union Square, then, in July 1894, in the Somerville Journal Building, built for that purpose. Other magazines printed in the Somerville Journal Building included the Journal of Education, the American Primary Teacher, and The Writer. A founder of The Writer, William Henry Hills, bought an interest in the Somerville Journal Company in 1890, and was reported as editor of the Journal and president of the Company in 1895.

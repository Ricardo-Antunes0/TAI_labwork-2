Agaricus hondensis, commonly known as the felt-ringed bolete, is a species of mushroom in the family Boletaceae. It was first described in 1778 by Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries.  The felt-ringed bolete is a small to medium-sized mushroom with a convex cap and a conspicuous ring of feltlike material around the edge. The color of the cap can be reddish brown, chocolate brown, or pale tan, and the gills are initially cream, but turn yellow when they become mature. The flesh is firm and white, and the taste is mild. It grows in groups on the ground or in decaying wood, and does not respond well to cooking.  The felt-ringed bolete is widespread in temperate regions of the world, and can be found in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australasia. It is also common in cultivation, and can be found growing under various types of trees and shrubs.

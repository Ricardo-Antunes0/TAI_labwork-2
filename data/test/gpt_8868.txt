Ram Saran Verma is an Indian farmer who, in 2012, became the first person to grow a crop of wheat in space.  Ram Saran Verma was born on January 17, 1965, in a village in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. He is a farmer who has been involved in agriculture for more than 25 years. In 2012, he became the first person to grow a crop of wheat in space. Verma's project was part of the Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) effort to explore ways to improve agriculture on Earth using technology that is available in space.  Verma's project was a success. His crop of wheat grew in the microgravity environment of the International Space Station and yielded a harvest that was indistinguishable from crops grown on Earth. Verma's project demonstrated that it is possible to grow crops in space and that space could be used as a platform to improve agricultural practices on Earth.

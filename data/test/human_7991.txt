John Kirton (4 March 1916 – 12 March 1996) was a Scottish footballer who played in the English Football League for Bradford City and Stoke City. He made 249 appearances for Stoke. Career Kirton was born in Aberdeen and played for St Marchers and Banks O' Dee, winning several Scottish schoolboy cap. Stoke City's Scottish based scouts recommend him to manager Bob McGrory who signed him in the summer of 1935 and he made a number of appearances as cover for Frank Soo over the following two seasons. Kirton's chance to claim his own place arrived when Soo moved to right half to fill in Arthur Turner's retirement in September 1938, playing in 38 matches in 1938–39. His career was interrupted by World War II and he continued to play for the club during the hostilities. He also guested for Leeds United, Nottingham Forest and Notts County. By chance he was in the same battalion as a number of his Stoke team-mates and the unit's team prospered well in the Army football cup.

Tanisha Marie Williams is an American botanist and the founder of #BlackBotanistsWeek. Williams created #BlackBotanistsWeek, an initiative started in 2020 promoting Black Botanists to share their work and life experiences on Twitter and Instagram after seeing similar initiatives for Black scientists in other fields. Williams' doctoral work focused on predicting plant adaptability to climate change, specifically plants in the Pelargonium genus in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. Early life and education  Williams was born and raised in Washington, D.C.

She completed a Master's degree at California State University at Los Angeles in 2012.

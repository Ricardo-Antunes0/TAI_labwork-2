were the feudal noble warrior class of Ethiopia. Originally recruited and appointed for the Emperor army service, they formed a class of professional soldiers, also known for traditional warriorhood practices and a rich cultural background.  They were allocated with land grants for their sustainement. Their installation in settlements were instrumental in creating the nucleus of urban centers as well as the land tenure system through Ethiopia and Eritrea. By the early 20th century, scholars could identify 66 villages in Eritrea with a Chewa settlement origin. Terminology In medieval Ethiopia, from the reign of Amde Tseyon, Chewa regiments, or legions, formed the backbone of the Empire's military forces.  The Ge’ez term for these regiments is ṣewa (ጼዋ) while the Amharic term is č̣äwa (ጨዋ). Earlier Axumite sources refer to sarawit (sing. sarwe) as the name for the regiments, each sarawit being headed by a negus (nägästa säräwit). In late sources, from Zemene Mesafint onwards, regional levies under a noble are referred to as wa'alyan of nobles.

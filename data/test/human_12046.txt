John Ringo (born March 22, 1963) is an American science fiction and military fiction author.  He has had several New York Times best sellers.  His books range from straightforward science fiction to a mix of military and political thrillers.  He has over seven million copies of his books in print, and his works have been translated into seven different languages. Life and career Ringo's father "was a civil engineer with an international firm"; before Ringo graduated in 1981 from Winter Park High School in Winter Park, Florida, he had spent time in 23 foreign countries, attending classes at fourteen schools. Among the countries he spent the most time in were Greece, Iran and Switzerland before he settled with his parents and six siblings in Alabama. This amount of travel brought what he refers to as a "wonderful appreciation of the oneness of humanity and a permanent aversion to foreign food."

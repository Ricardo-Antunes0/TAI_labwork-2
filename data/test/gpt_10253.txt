Jewish education (, Chinuch) is the transmission of Jewish religious beliefs, values and heritage to the next generation. The term "Jewish education" is commonly used to describe the totality of educational experiences that a person has in connection with being Jewish, including formal education, religious education, and supplementary education.  Jewish education has a long and varied history. The earliest examples of Jewish education can be traced back to the time of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. At that time, most Jews were illiterate and so religious teaching was an important part of their lives. Religious leaders formed schools to teach children the Bible and Talmud.  Although Jewish education has undergone many changes over the centuries, its basic principles have remained unchanged. Today, Jewish education is still based on the principle that every person is entitled to learn about his or her own religion. It is also based on the belief that learning about Judaism is an important part of a person's development as a Jew.  Jewish education is typically divided into three stages: early childhood education, elementary school, and secondary school. Each stage has its own set of requirements and guidelines.  Jewish education is not limited to any particular location or country. In fact, it is available worldwide. There are several types of Jewish educational institutions, including yeshivas (traditional Jewish schools), day schools, preschools and kindergartens, supplementary schools, and summer camps.  Jewish education is an important part of the life cycle of a Jew. It not only provides children with the knowledge and skills necessary

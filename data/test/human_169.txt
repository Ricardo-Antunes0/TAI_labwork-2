"Make a Secret"  is BoA's sixteenth Japanese single, and fifth lowest selling. The title track was used for a Kose Fasio commercial, and although the A-side track, "Make a Secret", was promoted, the B-side, "Long Time No See", won more acclaim and praise from fans. After the eyebrow-raising performance of her Do the Motion single, this single came as a huge disappointment to fans and staff alike. Overview Released on August 31, 2005, this was BoA's fourth lowest selling single until Dakishimeru was released in November. This single got little to no promotion, and the commercial for KOSE Fasio was rarely shown on television. Also, coinciding with the release of Mika Nakashima's Nana single (a single featuring songs from the huge movie hit, Nana, and which would go on to sell over 420,000 copies) this single was doomed to failure and would go on to barely sell 48,000 copies in three weeks, and 54,000 copies overall.

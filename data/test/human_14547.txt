Wang Wenhua (Simplified Chinese: 王文华) (born 17 January 1977) is a Chinese professional footballer and coach. As a player, he has spent the majority of his career with Wuhan Hongjinlong before he joined Hubei Greenery where nearing the end of his career he was offered a coaching position with the club before he retired. He has since come out of retirement and is currently playing for Xinjiang Tianshan Leopard. Biography  As with all the most promising young Chinese players Wang Wenhua would quickly be included in the short-lived Chinese national youth team program to study football abroad in a training programme sponsored by Jianlibao and called the Chinese Jianlibao Youth Football Team. As with his teammate Zheng Bin he would graduate through the Jianlibao Youth Team and return to his hometown to play for Wuhan Hongjinlong to start his professional football career. He would make his debut for Wuhan during the 1998 league season and make nine appearances in his debut season. Despite Wuhan getting relegated at the end of the 1999 league season he would remain loyal to the team and for the next several seasons he would establish himself as an energetic technically gifted winger who could also defend despite his rather thin and short stature. In the 2004 league season he would aid the team to a division title and promotion to the top tier. The following season saw Wuhan establish himself within the league and also win the Chinese Super League Cup in 2005.

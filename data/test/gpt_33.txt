The Park Avenue Viaduct, also known as the Harlem River Bridge, is a bridge that carries Park Avenue over the Harlem River in New York City. The bridge was designed by renowned architect J. Irwin Miller and opened on October 26, 1927.  The viaduct is a steel and concrete structure, with a main span of 1,595 feet (481 meters) and a total length of 3,000 feet (914 meters). It carries six lanes of traffic in each direction, with a pedestrian walkway on the east side. The bridge is owned and operated by the New York City Department of Transportation.  The viaduct has been criticized for its deteriorating condition, which has led to several closures and repairs. In 2008, the city announced plans to replace the viaduct with a new bridge. The new bridge, which is scheduled to open in 2019, will feature an arch-shaped design that is meant to resemble the Empire State Building.

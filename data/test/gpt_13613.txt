Zirconium alloys are solid solutions of zirconium and one or more metals. They are used in a variety of applications, including aircraft and spacecraft structures, medical implants, and nuclear fuel cladding.  Zirconium alloys are solid solutions of zirconium and one or more metals. They are used in a variety of applications, including aircraft and spacecraft structures, medical implants, and nuclear fuel cladding.  The alloying metals affect the physical and chemical properties of the zirconium. The most common alloying elements are titanium and vanadium, which make up about 60% of all zirconium alloys. Other alloying elements include aluminum, carbon, and silicon. These different elements create a wide range of properties that can be tailored to specific applications.  Zirconium alloys have a high strength-to-weight ratio and good resistance to corrosion and oxidation. They are also heat-treatable, so they can be made into high-performance parts. These properties make zirconium alloys ideal for a variety of applications, including aviation and spacecraft components, medical implants, nuclear fuel cladding, and vehicles.

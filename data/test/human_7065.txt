The Van Herick technique is an eye examination method used to determine the size of the anterior chamber angle of the eye. Glaucoma is currently the principal cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Therefore, The Van Herick technique is pertinent to the interests of all eye care practitioners as it permits for a quick and simple screening alternative to the conventional Gonioscopy examination. It should not however, be used as a replacement for the gonioscopy examination but rather be used as a means of refuting or confirming the results of a gonioscopy examination.   The Van Herick's technique has become the most commonly used qualitative method of assessing the size of the anterior chamber angle (ACA). Whereby, it involves comparing the depth of the peripheral anterior chamber to the thickness of the cornea, when a narrow beam is shone within the limbus at a 60Â°angle. The anterior chamber drainage angle is then graded as a ratio between the peripheral anterior chamber depth and corneal thickness (AC : C ratio)  or expressed traditionally as a fraction  to provide the Van Herick's result. Grading can also be obtained by distinguishing the structures visible upon observation. Each visible structure correlates to a Van Herick grade which can then be expressed a fraction.

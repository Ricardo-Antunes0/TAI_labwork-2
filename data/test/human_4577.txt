TerraTech is a construction sandbox game with action elements created and released by British developer Payload Studios on 10 August 2018 for Windows and Xbox One and four days later for PlayStation 4. A port to Nintendo Switch by Lab42 was released on 29 May 2019. Gameplay  A construction sandbox focusing on vehicular combat, the game offers a variety of blocks with different functions that can be combined in various ways using attach points on each, with the control block - a cab - always serving as a centrepoint. Wheel blocks in contact with ground enable driving, while wing blocks generate lift for flying and other blocks provide additional functions to the tech they are attached to. Beside vehicles, the game enables construction of static bases anchored to the ground that are mainly used for storage and crafting. Blocks can be crafted using resources gathered from the environment and a system of resource silos, conveyors and automatic factories (all blocks themselves).

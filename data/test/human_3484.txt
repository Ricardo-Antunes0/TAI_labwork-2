Sue H. Elmore was a steamboat built for service on the coast of Oregon and southwest Washington.  From 1900 to 1917, the vessel's principal route ran from Portland, Oregon down the Columbia River to Astoria, and then west across the Columbia Bar, then south along the Oregon coast to Tillamook Bay.  Once at Tillamook Bay, Sue H. Elmore was one of the few vessels that could reach Tillamook City at the extreme southern edge of the mostly very shallow bay.  After this Sue H. Elmore was sold, being operated briefly in Puget Sound under the name Bergen, and then for many years, out of San Diego, California as a tugboat under the name Cuyamaca.  During World War II Cuyamaca was acquired by the U.S. Army which operated the vessel as ST-361.  Afterwards the army sold ST-361 and the vessel returned to civilian ownership, again under the name Cuyamaca.  In 1948 Cuyamaca sank in a harbor in Venezuela, but was raised and by the early 1950s, was owned by one A. W. Smith, of Pensacola, Florida.  This vessel's former landing place in Tillamook, Oregon is now a municipal park named after the ship. Design Sue H. Elmore was built for the Pacific Navigation Company, which was closely linked to the S. Elmore Canning Company, with the wealthy businessman Samuel Elmore (1847-1910) being president of both concerns.  The steamer was named after Samuel Elmore's eldest daughter.  This vessel was generally called Elmore.

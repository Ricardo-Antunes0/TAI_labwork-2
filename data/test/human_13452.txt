PiliPinas Debates 2022 is an upcoming televised debate series organized by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), with the assistance of the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas in preparation for the 2022 general election. COMELEC confirmed that they will organize debates for both candidates running for president and vice-president. Unlike the debates in the 2016 elections, three presidential debates and three vice-presidential debates will be held.  Candidates will be following safety protocols stated by Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) with no audience participation due to the risks of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  A few weeks later, the commission said that in addition to the three debates each per position, they will hold a primary debate, as a teaser of sorts for the upcoming debates per position. They will also organize the debates themselves, a deviation from 2016 where they let the media organizations organize it. By January 2022, the commission said they might forego with the teaser debates, as the number of candidates have been reduced to a more manageable number.

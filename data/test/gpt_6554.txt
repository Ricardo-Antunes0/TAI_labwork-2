Darien is a coastal town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town had a population of 17,687. Darien is located at 41°5′N 73°24′W.  The area that became Darien was first settled in 1686 by Dutch colonists who established a small community on the banks of the Quinnipiac River. The town was incorporated in 1714 and named for the Duke of d'Argenteau, who had been appointed Governor-General of New France by King Louis XIV. Darien prospered as a port and shipbuilding center during the 18th and 19th centuries, but declined in importance after the opening of the Long Island Sound shipping lanes in the early 20th century. The town's economy has since rebounded, thanks in part to its strategic location along Interstate 95 and close proximity to New York City.  Darien is home to a number of historic buildings, including the 1801 County Courthouse, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places; and The Grange, an 1875 estate that is now a museum. The town is also known for its scenic coastline and numerous parks and beaches. Darien is also home to two private colleges, Quinnipiac University and Southern Connecticut State University.

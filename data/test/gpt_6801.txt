Pål Bang-Hansen (29 July 1937 – 25 April 2016) was a Norwegian mathematician and computer scientist.  Bang-Hansen was born in Oslo, Norway. He received a B.A. in mathematics from the University of Oslo in 1957, and a M.A. in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1958. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Oslo in 1966 under the supervision of Kjartan Skjelbred.  After postdoctoral research at Yale University and the University of Edinburgh, Bang-Hansen became an associate professor at the University of Oslo in 1970. He was promoted to professor there in 1984, and retired from that position in 2003. He served as president of the Norwegian Mathematical Society from 1996 to 1998, and as vice-president of the International Mathematical Union from 1999 to 2003.  Bang-Hansen's research focused on mathematical logic and its applications to computer science and artificial intelligence. His most famous result is the Pål Bang-Hansen theorem, which states that there is no algorithm that solves satisfiability problems in polynomial time with a given number of variables (i.e., problems whose solution can be determined by solving a Boolean equation).

The distance to 14 Vul, as determined from its annual parallax shift of , is around 174 light years. It is moving nearer with a heliocentric radial velocity of about −38 km/s, and will make its closest approach in a million years when comes to within about . This is an F-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of F1 Vn, where the 'n' notation indicates nebulous lines due to rapid rotation. At the estimated age of 1.7 billion years old, it is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 150 km/s and has sub-solar metallicity. The star has 1.5 times the mass of the Sun and is radiating 11 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of about 6,938 K.

Jesse Fortune (February 28, 1930 â€“ August 31, 2009) was an American Chicago blues singer and barber. Biography Born in Macon, Mississippi, Fortune was trained as a barber before moving to Chicago, Illinois, in 1952. In Chicago, he worked as a barber during the day and a blues singer at night.  Fortune became one of the most popular performers for "heavy duty vocal work" in the Chicago blues scene of the 1950s and 1960s.  In 1952, he was hired by Otis Rush as a vocalist for the Otis Rush Band show.  He also performed as a vocalist with Buddy Guy and Willie Dixon.  Fortune became better known as the "Fortune Tellin' Man."  Blues guitarist Dave Specter said of Fortune, "He was one of the great Chicago blues singers.  He had an amazingly powerful voice, kind of in the style of early B.B. King.  He had so much presence he almost didn't need a microphone." Fortune's best known recording was "Too Many Cooks," released in 1963.  The Robert Cray Band later covered Fortune's "Too Many Cooks."  Fortune released a number of records for the USA label, but became disillusioned with the music business.  He later said that he "never made a dime from his recordings."

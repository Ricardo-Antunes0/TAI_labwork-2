A staple food, food staple, or simply staple is a type of food that is eaten on a regular basis. Staples may be the most important food group for some people, and for others they may not be as important. In developed countries, where food is generally available in many forms and is not necessarily a staple, it often refers to items such as bread, cereal, pasta, rice, potatoes, eggs, milk and meat products.

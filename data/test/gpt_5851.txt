On January 17, 2020, 16 year-old Colin Haynie was shot and killed while riding his bike home from school in the city of Scottsdale, Arizona. Haynie is the seventh child and fourth son of Diane and Colin Haynie.   Haynie was a popular high school student, captain of the football team, and member of the math club. He was also active in church and volunteer work. On the evening of his death, Haynie had just finished his last class of the day and was on his way home.   Police believe that Haynie was targeted by his killers, who fired several shots from a car at him as he rode past. The shooting appears to have been a random act of violence. No arrests have been made in connection with the murder, and investigators are still trying to determine a motive for the crime.

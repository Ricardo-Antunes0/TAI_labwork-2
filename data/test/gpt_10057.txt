John B. Macy (March 25, 1799 – December 28, 1868) was an American politician and jurist who served as the 23rd Governor of New York from 1838 to 1841 and the 25th United States Attorney General from 1849 to 1853.  Macy was born in Fishkill, New York, the son of Charles Macy and Elizabeth (née Horsley) Macy. He was educated at the Dutchess County Institute and then at the University of Virginia, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1821. He practiced law in Fishkill until 1830, when he moved to New York City and became a partner in the law firm of Clark, Macy, and & Co.  Macy entered politics as a Democrat and served two terms as Secretary of State of New York (1830–1834). In 1838, he was elected Governor of New York, defeating Whig incumbent George Clinton by a wide margin. During his term, he signed legislation creating the University of the State of New York at Albany (now Albany University), established a state lunatic asylum at Utica, and enacted an anti-slavery law.  In 1840, Macy was nominated by President James K. Polk to be Attorney General of the United States; he was confirmed by the United States Senate and served until March 3, 1853. In this capacity, he successfully prosecuted several prominent political figures, including former U.S. Vice President Aaron Burr for treason.  After leaving office

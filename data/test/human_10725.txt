It is native to large river channels and major side branches in the Amazon Basin, and is common in the Tefé River and the Rio Solimões to a depth of . It is found in both whitewater and blackwater habitats. The species name preto comes from the Portuguese word for "black", referring to its coloration. As its scientific name suggests, S. preto is distinguished from all other Sternarchogiton species by its entirely dark brown to purplish black color. The fins have hyaline rays and dark brown membranes. The body is a laterally compressed and knife-shaped, with a nearly straight dorsal profile. The head is laterally compressed with a convex dorsal profile and small eyes that are covered by a membrane. Unlike other Sternarchogiton species it has long, conical teeth (numbering 5 plus 2-3 replacements) on the premaxillary of the upper jaw; there is one row of teeth (numbering 10 plus 3 replacements) on the dentary bone of the lower jaw. Both upper and lower pharyngeal tooth plates are present, bearing 6 and 4-5 teeth respectively.

Camponotus ligniperda, the brown-black carpenter ant, is a common species of carpenter ant distributed widely throughout Europe. Found in a variety of woodland habitats, they commonly nest on the ground in dry tree stumps, dead fallen trees, or beneath stones and wooden logs that are partially buried. C. ligniperda is an ecologically dominant species wherever it is found due to both its large size and particularly aggressive nature. Description Camponotus ligniperda is one of if not the largest extant ant species found in Europe, with queens reaching lengths of 16–18 mm (potentially 20 mm when physogastric) followed by 14–15 mm major workers. Intermediate and minor workers measure on average 7–10 mm. Individuals are typically bicolored with a black head and a reddish brown thorax which color bleeds into the legs and anterior segment of the dark colored gaster. Considered a sister species to Camponotus herculeanus, the species can be distinguished by its larger size, brighter color and shinier gaster.

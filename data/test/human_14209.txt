Edward Herbert Wright (September 28, 1863 in New York CityAugust 6, 1930 in Rochester, Minnesota) was an American politician and political activist who helped play a pivotal early role in African-American political participation in Chicago.  A graduate of the College of the City of New York at 17 years old, Wright taught in New Jersey for three years. After his arrival in Chicago while looking for a job, Wright found odd jobs such as assisting a Pullman porter, working as a real estate office assistant and working in the registry department of the post office. He soon caught the eye of local elected officials, and was hired into the county clerk’s office. Wright participated in the 1888 Republican National Convention, which was hosted in Chicago, and was rewarded for his work by being hired as bookkeeper and railroad incorporation clerk in the secretary of state’s office, the first African-American to be appointed to a clerical position in state government. After Secretary Isaac N. Pearson's term ended, Wright left his position to work in the Chicago city clerk’s office for two years. He was then elected 1895 for a one-year term as South Town clerk, and helped secure the 1894 election of Theodore W. Jones as Cook County commissioner, the second African-American to be elected to the commission (and a relative of John Jones, the first African-American elected to the commission in 1872). By 1896, Wright became the third African-American county commissioner, and was also admitted to the bar that same year.

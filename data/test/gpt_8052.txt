Typhoon Francisco, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Hagupit, was a powerful and destructive typhoon that affected the Philippines and China in September 2013. It was the strongest typhoon to make landfall in China since 1949, and the strongest typhoon to make landfall in the Philippines since Super Typhoon Yolanda in 2013. The storm also caused extensive damage to both countries, with over $2 billion (2013 USD) worth of damage reported in the Philippines.  Francisco originated from a tropical disturbance that was first identified on satellite imagery on September 10th. Throughout the day, the disturbance tracked generally northwestward, and by early on September 11th it had attained tropical storm status. Over the next day or so, Francisco intensified further as winds increased to 150 mph (240 km/h). Early on September 13th, Francisco reached its peak intensity with winds of 175 mph (280 km/h), making it a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. After reaching this peak intensity, Francisco began to slowly weaken as it moved over cooler waters. On September 14th, Francisco made landfall in southern Luzon as a Category 4 hurricane. After landfall, Francisco rapidly weakened over land, and by early on September 15th it had dissipated over China.  Throughout its duration, Francisco caused widespread damage across both the Philippines and China. In the Philippines, over 1 million people were left without power following landfall. In China, Francisco killed at least 22 people and caused extensive damage to infrastructure. Combined,

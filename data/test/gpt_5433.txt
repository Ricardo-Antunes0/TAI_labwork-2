Mu Andromedae (Mu And, μ Andromedae, μ And) is the Bayer designation for a star in the northern constellation of Andromeda. The bright star is about twice as distant from Earth as the Sun, and is thus barely visible to the naked eye.  Mu Andromedae is a yellow-hued A-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of A8 V. It is around 1.6 times the mass of the Sun, and has the typical properties of an A-type star. The star has an apparent magnitude of 5.0, which means that it can be seen with the naked eye under good conditions.  Mu Andromedae is not particularly variable, but it does show some small variations in its brightness over time. It has been observed to fluctuate by up to 0.02% in magnitude over a period of about 10 days.

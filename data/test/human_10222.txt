 Guthram Gowt is a small settlement in the South Holland district of Lincolnshire, England. It is situated  both east from Bourne and west from Spalding, and at a bend in the River Glen. History The word 'gowt'  refers to a sluice or outflow, though the origin of the word is not known with complete certainty. It appears to be cognate with the French Ã©gout, sewer. Though the modern mind associates the word 'sewer' with foul water, it was not always necessarily so. There are several 'gowt' placenames on the fens, including Anton's Gowt. In a reference that predates the pumping works, the nearby turnpike toll gate was known as Guthram Cote. This is indicative, as though the spelling and form of the name vary considerably, there appears to be no reference to the use of 'gowt' in connection with Guthram's Cote before the steam engine was installed. The earlier name was still in use contemporary with the use of the engine.

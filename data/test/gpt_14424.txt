Iranian nationalism (Persian: , romanized: , Kurdish:, تۆرۆکردنی هاوەندان‎) refers to the nationalism of the Iranian people. It is manifested in various ways, including through such expressions as "Iranian pride" and "Iranian spirit" and is a major political force in Iran.  Nationalism has been a central part of Iranian identity since the time of the Iranian Revolution in 1979. The revolution was partly motivated by Iranian nationalism, which sought to end the rule of the Pahlavi dynasty and restore the sovereignty of Iran. Iranian nationalism has also been associated with Islamic fundamentalism and anti-Western sentiment.  Since the Iranian Revolution, Iranian nationalism has been opposed by the government of Iran as well as by sections of the Iranian diaspora.

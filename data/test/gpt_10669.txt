Energy, nutrients, and contaminants derived from aquatic ecosystems are routinely discharged into terrestrial ecosystems, where they can cause negative consequences for both plant and animal life. Aquatic-terrestrial subsidies (ATS) are a type of environmental input that can facilitate the exchange of these substances between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.  ATS can provide nutrients and energy to aquatic systems, as well as reduce the amount of pollutants and contaminants that enter terrestrial systems. ATS can also help to improve water quality in aquatic systems and support the growth of aquatic plants and animals. However, ATS can also have negative impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, including the introduction of harmful pollutants and the degradation of soil resources.  The benefits and risks of ATS must be carefully weighed before they are implemented in order to ensure that they have the most positive impact on both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.

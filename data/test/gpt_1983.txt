Malcolm "Cam" Cameron (born February 6, 1961) is a Canadian politician who has been the Prime Minister of Canada since 2006. He previously served as the 29th Prime Minister of Canada from 2000 to 2006.  Cameron was born in Glasgow, Scotland, to Welsh parents. He moved to Canada with his family at the age of nine and subsequently became a naturalized citizen. Cameron graduated from the University of British Columbia with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics in 1983, and later completed his Juris Doctor at the University of Toronto.  Cameron began his career as a lawyer, working for the provincial government of Ontario. He joined the federal Conservative Party in 1987 and was elected to Parliament in 1988, representing the riding of Scarborough-Agincourt. He served as Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party from 2002 to 2004, and then became Leader following the retirement of John Anderson.  Under Cameron's leadership, the Conservative Party won a majority government in the 2004 general election. In 2006, he was appointed Prime Minister after leading his party to victory in the Canadian federal election that year. As Prime Minister, Cameron has pursued economic deregulation, including through controversial moves such as passing Bill C-38 which weakened environmental protections, and cuts to social services such as healthcare and education. Critics have labelled these policies "negative Toryism", while Cameron has defended them by arguing that they are necessary measures to stimulate economic growth and create jobs.

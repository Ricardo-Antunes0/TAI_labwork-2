Lauren Elizabeth Cox (born April 20, 1998) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). She played college basketball for the Baylor Lady Bears. Prior to the start of the 2019, she was a preseason All-American by Lindy's Sports, Athlon Sports, and Street & Smith. In November 2019, ESPN ranked Cox as the second-best collegiate women's basketball player in the country behind Sabrina Ionescu. She would be named Big 12 Player of the Year that season. Cox was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 7. She wears an insulin pump during games. In each season of Cox's Baylor career, the Lady Bears played a preseason type 1 diabetes benefit game. The 2019 edition of the game, in Cox's final season at Baylor, was especially significant for her personally, as the opponent was defending NCAA Division II champion Lubbock Christian, which featured her younger sister Whitney—who had been diagnosed with the disease at age 17—as a freshman reserve. Near the end of the 2019–20 season, the United States Basketball Writers Association announced that both sisters would receive the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award for their basketball and community involvement in the face of their condition.

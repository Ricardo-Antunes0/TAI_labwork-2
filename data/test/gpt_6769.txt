Arenysaurus is a genus of hadrosaurid dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period in what is now Spain. It is known from a single specimen, a complete skull and skeleton. The genus name is derived from the Arenys River, where the remains were discovered.  Arenysaurus was a medium-sized hadrosaurid, measuring around long and weighing around . The skull is very fragmentary, but appears to have been large and heavily built. It had a large head with a flat snout and large eyes. The teeth are unusually shaped and resemble those of an iguana or alligator.  The only known specimen of Arenysaurus was discovered in 1996 near Arenys de Mar, in the province of Huesca, by a team of Spanish palaeontologists led by José Luis Martínez-Orgado. The fossil was found together with other bones of other dinosaurs, including a possible juvenile Spinosaurus aegyptiacus. Arenysaurus is the first hadrosaurid to be discovered in Spain.

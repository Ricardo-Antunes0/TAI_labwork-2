Vietnamese numismatic charms (Vietnamese: Bùa Việt Nam; literally "Vietnamese coins") are a type of folk art that emerged in the early 20th century in Vietnam. They often depict scenes from Vietnamese history or legend, as well as traditional Vietnamese motifs.  Vietnamese numismatic charms are made from a variety of materials, including bronze, brass, silver, and gold. They are typically small, measuring no more than 2 cm wide and 1 cm deep. Some of the most popular charms are those that depict scenes from the Vietnamese epic poem the Đại Bái Cổ Sơn (The Tragic Tale of Kỳ Dương), which is one of Vietnam's national epics.  Vietnamese numismatic charms are often sold at traditional markets and fairs in Vietnam, as well as online. They are also used as decorative pieces in homes and businesses.

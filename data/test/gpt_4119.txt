Di Astud Chor ("On the Securing of the Path") is a Tibetan Buddhist term used to describe the practice of meditation in the context of everyday life. The path is secured by focusing on the breath and developing good habits.  The term comes from the first line of the Sanskrit text "Bodhicharyavatara," which reads "By discipline and contemplation one reaches the state of nirvana." In Buddhism, nirvana is the ultimate goal of the path to liberation.  Meditation is an essential part of Buddhist practice, and it is said that without it, one cannot attain enlightenment. There are many types of meditation, but the most common is called "vipassana" (insight). Vipassana meditation involves observing your thoughts and feelings without getting carried away by them.  Some people find that Di Astud Chor is a helpful way to live their lives. By focusing on the breath and developing good habits, they can ensure that they are on the right path and that they will eventually reach nirvana.

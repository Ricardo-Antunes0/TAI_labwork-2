Sulgrave Manor, Sulgrave, Northamptonshire, England is a mid-16th century Tudor hall house built by Lawrence Washington, the great-great-great-great grandfather of George Washington, first President of the United States. The manor passed out of the hands of the Washington family in the 17th century and by the 19th had descended to the status of a farmhouse. In 1911, Theodore Roosevelt, the former president, suggested a memorial to commemorate 100 years of peace between England and the United States, and the manor was bought for this purpose in 1914. Between 1920 and 1930 the manor was restored, and a garden created by Reginald Blomfield. Sulgrave Manor is now administered by a trust and is a Grade I listed building. History The ancestors of George Washington originated in Wessyngton in the north-east of England in the 12th century after assuming tenancy of the area from the Bishop of Durham in exchange for Hertburn. In the 14th century they moved south, to Warton in Lancashire, and in the fifteenth, to Sulgrave in Northamptonshire. Northamptonshire had been prominent in the wool trade since the Middle Ages, and Lawrence Washington achieved success as a wool trader and built Sulgrave Manor between 1540-1560. His great-grandson, also Lawrence, was born at the manor in 1602. The Washingtons sold the house in the mid-17th century, and a descendent, John Washington (1631â€“1677), great-grandfather of George, emigrated to Virginia in 1656. In the 18th century Sulgrave was tenanted to a series of farmers. The west wing was demolished circa 1780, and by the early 20th century the manor was derelict.

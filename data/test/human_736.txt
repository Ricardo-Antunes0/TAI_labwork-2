In 1827 he founded the Royal Conservatory of Music in Copenhagen. He was married three times during his life, including his second marriage to the sister of poet Franz von Schober. His third marriage produced a son, the composer and pianist Erik Siboni (1828–1892). Life and career Born in Forlì, Siboni studied singing in his native city with castrato Sebastiano Folicaldi. He made his professional opera debut in 1797 at the age of 17 in Florence. Over the next several years he sang with various Italian opera troupes, making appearances in Genoa, Milan, and Prague among other cities.

He returned there the following year to sing the role of Marco Orazio in Domenico Cimarosa's Gli Orazi e i Curiazi.

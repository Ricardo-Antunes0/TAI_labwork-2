She is the lead singer and co-founder of the Australian pop group Wilson Phillips, which achieved international success in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Wilson has also had a successful solo career, appearing in a number of successful films and television shows throughout the 1990s and 2000s.  Wilson was born in Melbourne to parents John and Doreen Wilson. The family relocated to Sydney when she was young, and Wilson began her musical career as a member of the girl group The Wiggles. The Wiggles disbanded in 2001, but Wilson continued to record and perform with various side projects until reforming Wilson Phillips in 2006. The group released two albums before disbanding again in 2010. Wilson has since released two more solo albums and starred in several television shows and films.

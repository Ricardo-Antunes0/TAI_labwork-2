Oh Manapenne!  is a 2021 Indian Tamil-language romantic comedy film directed by Kaarthikk Sundar in his directorial debut and written by Deepak Sundarrajan. A remake of the Telugu film Pelli Choopulu (2016), it stars Harish Kalyan and Priya Bhavani Shankar as a boy and girl who meet during a matchmaking event. How their aspirations bring them together forms the rest of the story. The rights to remake Pelli Choopulu in Tamil were initially acquired by Gautham Vasudev Menon in 2016, and the film titled Pon Ondru Kandein was to be directed by Senthil Veerasamy, with Vishnu Vishal and Tamannaah starring. The project faced delays and was ultimately shelved due to budgetary constraints; by November 2019, it had undergone a complete change in cast and crew. The new film, Oh Manapenne!, began shooting in December 2019 and wrapped in February 2020. It was released on 22 October 2021 via Disney+ Hotstar.

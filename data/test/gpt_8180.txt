The Oxford–Cambridge Arc (formerly the Cambridge – Oxford Arc) is a term used to describe the sporting rivalry between the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in England. The rivalry is primarily in association football, where the two universities are known as The Blues.  The rivalry is believed to date back to the 16th century, when both universities were founded. From then on, the two teams have contesting almost every major honour in English football. The most recent occasion was in 2013, when Cambridge won the FA Cup. However, Oxford has a long-standing record of success in the sport, having won more FA Cups than any other university.  The rivalry has also taken on a literary flavour. Many famous writers have been associated with either Oxford or Cambridge, including George Orwell, C.S. Lewis and W.B. Yeats.

Intracellular pH (pHi) is the measure of the acidity or basicity (i.e., pH) of intracellular fluid. The pHi plays a critical role in membrane transport and other intracellular processes. In an environment with the improper pHi, biological cells may have compromised function. Therefore, pHi is closely regulated in order to ensure proper cellular function, controlled cell growth, and normal cellular processes. The mechanisms that regulate pHi are usually considered to be plasma membrane transporters of which two main types exist — those that are dependent and those that are independent of the concentration of bicarbonate . Physiologically normal intracellular pH is most commonly between 7.0 and 7.4, though there is variability between tissues (e.g., mammalian skeletal muscle tends to have a pHi of 6.8–7.1). There is also pH variation across different organelles, which can span from around 4.5 to 8.0. pHi can be measured in a number of different ways. Homeostasis  Intracellular pH is typically lower than extracellular pH due to lower concentrations of HCO3−. A rise of extracellular (e.g., serum) partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) above 45 mmHg leads to formation of carbonic acid, which causes a decrease of pHi as it dissociates:

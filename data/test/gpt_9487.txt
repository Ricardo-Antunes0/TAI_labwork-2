Church architecture refers to the architecture of places of worship, particularly churches. It encompasses the design and construction of the external structure, the decoration and fittings of the interior, and the management of the building.  The earliest churches were built in the 1st century AD, as early as 27 AD, in Jerusalem, by Saint Peter. Early Christian churches were typically built of wood, but later became more elaborate with the use of stone and brick. The Roman Catholic Church is credited with popularizing Romanesque architecture. This architectural style flourished from about 1100 to 1200 AD and was marked by its use of pointed arches and ribbed vaults. Gothic architecture emerged in 12th century Europe, originating in France, and is characterized by its sharply pointed arches, intricate details, and ribbed vaults. Renaissance architecture began in Italy in the 14th century and is marked by its use of lighter materials such as marble and stone, greater emphasis on symmetry and proportion, and a return to classical forms. The Baroque style emerged in 17th century Europe and is characterized by its ornate details, dramatic lines, and use of curved elements.   During the 20th century, modern architecture began to emerge, characterized by its simple forms, use of glass and steel materials, and emphasis on open spaces.

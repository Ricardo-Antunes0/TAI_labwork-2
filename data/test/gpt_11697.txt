The Wilbraham's Almshouses, also known as the Nantwich Almshouses, are a Grade II* listed building in the town of Nantwich, Cheshire, England.  The almshouses were founded in 1701 by the wealthy textile manufacturer and philanthropist, John Wilbraham. They were originally built as a single large structure on the east side of High Street, but were later divided into six separate dwellings. A chapel was added in 1811. The almshouses are now operated as a retirement home for elderly people.

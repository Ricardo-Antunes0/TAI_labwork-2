The Great Retreat , also known as the Second Retreat, is a military operation led by the Chinese Nationalist Army against the communist forces in 1949.  The operation was launched on October 15, 1948, and concluded on November 6 of that year. The goal of the campaign was to clear rebel forces from northwest China and to restore order to the region. The Nationalists suffered significant losses, but they were ultimately successful in their objectives.  The Great Retreat is considered to be one of the most decisive moments in the Chinese Civil War. It is also one of the largest military operations in Chinese history.

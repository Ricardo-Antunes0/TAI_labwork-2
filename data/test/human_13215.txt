Harald Alfred Hauge (1876–1901) was a Norwegian painter who is remembered for his symbolist works. In 1894, he was one of ten artists who spent the summer months together in the collective known as Vågåsommeren. During his short life he travelled to Denmark, Belgium, France and Spain. Works by Hauge are in the collection of the National Museum of Norway. Biography Born on 5 February 1876 in Kristiania, today's Oslo, Harald Alfred Hauge was the son of the merchant Alfred Theodor Gustav Hauge and his wife Ellen Lætitia née Read. After both his parents died while he was still young, he was raised by Captain Peter Berg. In the spring of 1894, he left school intending to study painting at Harriet Backer's art college in Stockholm. Backer asked Lars Jorde, one of her students, to take Hauge to Gudbrandsdalen in June 1894 so that he could spend the summer months with the other painters from the school at the collective known as Vågåsommeren. The others in the group were Thorvald Erichsen, Johanna Bugge, Halfdan Egedius, Kristen Holbø, Lalla Hvalstad, Kris Laache, Alice Pihl, and Oluf Wold-Torne. They were all impressed by the dark-coloured symbolist landscapes he painted in the evenings with strong lyrical features.

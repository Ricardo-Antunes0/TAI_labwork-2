The Gorilla Project refers to a former project of the University of California, Santa Cruz, that aimed to create a population of genetically engineered gorillas. The project was abandoned in 2001 after several failed attempts to create viable offspring from two female gorillas.  The Gorilla Project was first conceived in the early 1980s by Professor Harry Harlow and his students at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The project aimed to create a population of genetically engineered gorillas by transferring genes from human embryos into the eggs of two female gorillas. The project was abandoned in 2001 after several failed attempts to create viable offspring from two female gorillas.

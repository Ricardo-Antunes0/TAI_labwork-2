The Skara Missal is a 12th-century illuminated manuscript, a missal kept in Stifts- och landsbiblioteket i Skara, a library in Skara, Sweden. It is the oldest surviving missal of this kind in Scandinavia. It is written in Latin, and is in folio format. Only about one eighth of the original remains, or 44 pages. The book was originally bound in a single volume, but is since the 13th or 14th century split into two volumes. One of the volumes is currently part of the permanent exhibition of Västergötland Museum. It was written by two different scribes. It contains text, illuminations and musical notes. The illuminations consist of two full page illustrations, four large decorative initials and a number of smaller ones. Certain traits indicate that the illuminator may have come from Scandinavia. The Skara Missal is sometimes referred to as "Sweden's oldest book" but its origins remain unclear. It may have been made in Winchester (England), Normandy (France), or possibly Norway; it mentions the saint Swithun who was venerated in both England and Norway. Studies of its contents have pointed to possible connections with other illuminated manuscripts from Fulda (Germany), Echternach (Luxembourg), Winchcombe (England) as well as French manuscripts. The missal is mentioned in the catalogue of the library in Skara for the first time in 1748, but according to the Skara Stiftshistoriska Sällskap (Skara Diocese Historical Society) it has belonged to the Diocese of Skara since the Middle Ages.

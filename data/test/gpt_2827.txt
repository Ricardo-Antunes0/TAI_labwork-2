Janet (Jenny) Armstrong (9 May 1903 - 23 September 1984) was a Scottish shepherd who became the first person to be cloned from an adult somatic cell. She was born in the small town of Kirkmichael, in the Highland council area of Scotland, to John and Margaret Armstrong.  Armstrong was born on 9 May 1903, in the small town of Kirkmichael, in the Highland council area of Scotland. The Armstrongs were a farming family who raised sheep and cattle. Armstrong began her working life as a shepherd, and in 1929, she married Hugh Macdonald. The couple had one child, a daughter named Jean.  In 1978, Armstrong became the first person to be cloned from an adult somatic cell. The process of cloning involved taking a sample of cells from Armstrong's body and growing them into embryos. The embryos were then implanted into surrogate mothers who carried them to term. The clones were eventually brought to life by physicians at the University of Edinburgh.  Armstrong died on 23 September 1984 at the age of 81. She was inducted into the Scottish Science Hall of Fame in 1985.

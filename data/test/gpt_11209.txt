German Type XXIII submarines were the first operational submarines with a hydro-pneumatic ramming system. They were also the first submarines to be designed for deep water operation.   The Type XXIII submarines were developed in the late 1930s by the Kriegsmarine (Germany's navy) as a replacement for the earlier Type XXI submarines. The Type XXIII submarines were larger and had more powerful engines than their predecessors, and were designed to operate at greater depths than the Type XXI submarines. The first Type XXIII submarines, the U-boat U-183, was commissioned in 1941.   The Type XXIII submarines were armed with six torpedo tubes and four deck guns. They were also the first submarines to be equipped with a hydro-pneumatic ramming system, which allowed them to attack enemy ships at close range. The hydro-pneumatic ramming system was later used on the Type XXI and Type XXII submarines, and was eventually developed into the system used on modern submarines such as the US Navy's nuclear-powered submarine fleet.

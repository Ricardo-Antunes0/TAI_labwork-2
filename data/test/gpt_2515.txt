Pterostylis concava, commonly known as the pouched pterostylis, is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia.  The pouched pterostylis is a terrestrial orchid with a single leaf and up to fifteen small, white flowers with green stripes. The sepals and petals are joined at the base, giving the flower a concave appearance. The flower stem is short and the flowers are arranged along the stem in an upright fashion.  The pouched pterostylis is found near the coast in the south-west of Western Australia between Busselton and Albany. It grows in shallow soils in coastal heath and shrubland.

Chinatown in Manchester, England, is an ethnic enclave of Chinese people in the city. It is located in the Northern Quarter of Manchester, close to the University of Manchester and close to the Mancunian Way.   The first Chinese people arrived in Manchester in the mid-19th century, when they were employed as labourers in the city's mills. The area around Chinatown began to develop as an ethnic enclave in the 1970s, when Chinese immigrants began to settle there. Today, Chinatown is home to a number of restaurants and businesses, as well as a number of temples and churches.

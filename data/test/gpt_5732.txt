Dubei class target ship (AGT) and rangefinder ship (ARL) were a class of Japanese naval ships designed and built during World War II.  In 1937, the IJN decided to build a new class of target ship, designated as the Dubei class. The Dubei class was a scaled-down version of the larger Oyashio-class battleship. The first ship in the class, the Daitō, was laid down in 1940 and launched in 1941.   The Dubei class was armed with six 8 inch guns in three twin gun turrets and carried a complement of 150 officers and crew. The ships were also equipped with a rangefinder ship, which allowed them to accurately fire their guns at long distances.   The Dubei class played an important role in training Japanese officers and crew in the art of naval warfare. They also served as target ships for training new recruits. The last ship in the class, the Yūdō, was decommissioned in 1945.   The Dubei class was replaced by the larger Oyashio class target ship in 1944.

Żyleta  is a common name of a northern stand at the Stadion Wojska Polskiego in Warsaw, Poland, traditionally occupied by the most spontaneous and fanatical fans of Legia Warsaw football club. Before the stadium renovation (2008–2011), the "old" Żyleta referred only to the center section within the eastern stand of the stadium (occasionally, it would also refer to eastern stand as a whole). There is a special exhibition dedicated to the "old" Żyleta in the Legia club museum. Today, after the stadium renovation, the "new" Żyleta means the whole northern stand of stadium (located behind the goal). The eastern stand of the stadium was constructed in the 1930s. Until the late 1970s, the stand was simply referred to as the "open" stand (in contrast to the "covered" western stand, which was fully roofed). The eastern stand was nicknamed "Żyleta" after the Polsilver razor billboard that was placed above its center section. The name has been in use since the late 1970s. The razor billboard was removed from the stadium by way of punishment imposed on Legia supporters, after the riots during the 1995 Polish Cup final.

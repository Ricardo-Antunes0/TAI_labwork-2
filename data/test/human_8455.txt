Rodrigo (HWV 5) is an opera in three acts composed by George Frideric Handel.  Its original title was Vincer se stesso Ã¨ la maggior vittoria ("To overcome oneself is the greater victory").  The opera is based on the historical figure of Rodrigo, the last Visigothic king of Spain.  The libretto was based on Francesco Silvani's II duello d'Amore e di Vendetta ("The conflict between love and revenge").  Dating from 1707, it was Handel's first opera written for performance in Italy, and the first performance took place in Florence late in 1707. The opera was revived in 1984, in Innsbruck. A lost fragment from Act III had been found in 1983, and a more complete production was given by the Handel Opera Society under Charles Farncombe at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London in 1985. Among other performances, Rodrigo was staged in Karlsruhe in 1987, by the Handel Festival, Halle in 2002 and by the International Festival of Baroque and Romantic Opera, Beaune, France, in 2018.

The German language in East Germany (DDR), during its existence as a separate state from 1949 to 1990, developed differently from the German of West Germany because of significant differences in the country's political and socio-cultural environment. Additionally, from the late 1960s onwards the political leaders of the DDR were intent on affirming the independence of their state by "isolationist linguistic politics"<ref>{{Citation| last  = Müller| first = Gerhard| title = Der "Besserwessi" und die "innere Mauer".

This political effort did not amount to the creation of a new language in the DDR but brought about a particular usage of the language and of linguistic behaviours specific to it, felt not in syntax or grammar, but in vocabulary, and manifesting itself in both the official and non-official spheres.

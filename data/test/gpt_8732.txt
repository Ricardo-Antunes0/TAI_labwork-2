The Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT) is a standardized intelligence test that has been used in research and assessment since the 1960s. The test is composed of six subtests: the Block Design (BD), Matrix Reasoning (MR), Symbol Search (SS), Picture Naming (PN), and Digit Span (DS).  The CogAT is a well-known and widely used intelligence test, and has been used in research and assessment since the 1960s. It is composed of six subtests: the Block Design (BD), Matrix Reasoning (MR), Symbol Search (SS), Picture Naming (PN), and Digit Span (DS).   The BD subtests assess spatial ability, reasoning with symbols, and pattern recognition. The MR subtests assess mental rotation, arithmetic reasoning, and working memory. The SS subtests assess spatial visualization, number sense, and arithmetical reasoning. The PN subtests assess visual memory for objects and pictures, number sense, and working memory for digits. The DS subtests assess working memory for digits.

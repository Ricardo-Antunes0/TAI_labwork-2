Boblbee (also expressed as BOBLBEÂ·E when used on their products; , ) is a corporation that began in 1997 as a think tank for research and development of sports and recreational equipment. This led to the design and manufacture of hardshell and softshell backpacks. Their hardshell backpacks are best known for their impact reduction capabilities (between 86% - 93% depending on the model), unusual design, and accompanying accessory range. They have received two Good Design Awards. In 2015, the company became part of the Point 65 Sweden and their product range was re-launched under the new brand name. Their flagship store & corporate headquarters is located in Stockholm, Sweden. History The creator of the Boblbee packs, industrial designer Jonas Blanking, has a background in the automotive and sports industries having worked with such companies as Alfa Romeo, Volvo, Porsche and sports-gear maker Salomon. As an outdoorsman, he had trouble with conventional backpack designs that left expensive electronics or paperwork vulnerable to damage in the event of an accident or inclement weather. He set out to design a new type of backpack, unlike those considered suitable for sports such as hiking and biking, that would have to be rigid, protective, and provide adequate volume.

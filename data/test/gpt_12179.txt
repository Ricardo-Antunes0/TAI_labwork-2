An exogenote is a piece of donor material that has been added to a genome without being inherited from either parent. The addition may be deliberate, as with the use of recombinant DNA techniques, or accidental, as with the insertion of a foreign gene by homologous recombination.  Exogenotes can have a variety of functions in the genome, such as providing new genetic material for gene expression or regulating gene function. They can also play an important role in the maintenance of genome integrity, as they can contribute to the removal of damaged or defective genes.  Exogenotes can be created in a number of ways, including the use of recombinant DNA techniques and the insertion of foreign genes by homologous recombination. They can also be generated unintentionally as a result of environmental contamination or viral infection.

Basic story Chen Zhen is depicted as an apprentice of the martial artist Huo Yuanjia, who founded the Chin Woo Athletic Association (also known as Chin Woo School or Jingwu School) in 1910. After Huo Yuanjia meets his demise under dubious circumstances, Chen Zhen discovers that his shih-fu was poisoned by their rivals from a Japanese dojo in Hongkou District, Shanghai. The furious apprentice seeks to bring the murderers to justice and embarks on a brutal quest to avenge Huo Yuanjia and revive his shih-fu's legacy, the "Jingwu Spirit".

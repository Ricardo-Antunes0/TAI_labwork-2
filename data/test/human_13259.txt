A slouch sock is a type of sock popular in the 1980s featuring a heavy non-elastic upper that may be pushed down into heavy folds around the ankles or pulled up to the knee. Slouch socks also tend to have a foot that is made of very thin fabric, to encourage layering of the socks. A popular 1980s fashion trend involved wearing multiple pairs of slouch socks to create a very thick, heavy slouching affect around the wearer's ankles. Slouch socks come in two primary varieties. "Flat-knit" slouch socks have no elastic and have a "two by two" knitting pattern. The Wigwam 622 Slouch Sock is a popular example of this style of sock; for many years was one of the best-selling varieties of slouch socks in America. The "flat-knit" term comes from the fact that the ribbing of the socks has a relatively squared-off appearance. "Rib-knit" slouch socks are so-named because of their rounded ribbing. This is the style of slouch socks typically worn by waitresses at popular restaurants such as Hooters and Wing House.

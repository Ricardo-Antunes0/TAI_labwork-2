Solomon Grigorevich Mogilevsky (; 1885 â€“ March 6, 1936) was a Russian mathematician and logician, who made fundamental contributions to algebra, logic, and the theory of probability. He is also considered to be one of the founders of modern mathematical logic.  Mogilevsky was born in 1885 in Kiev into a Jewish family. He studied at the University of Kiev under the guidance of Aleksandr Nechepovich Chernin and Vladimir Arnold Zilberstein, receiving his PhD in 1911.   In 1912, he became a professor at Moscow State University. In 1916, he moved to the University of Berlin, where he remained until his death in 1936. Mogilevsky is best known for his work in Boolean algebra and formal logic, but he also made significant contributions to analysis, number theory, probability theory, and functional analysis.  Mogilevsky was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1916), the German Academy of Sciences (1919), and the French Academy of Sciences (1920). In 1935 he was awarded the Stalin Prize for his work on Boolean algebra.

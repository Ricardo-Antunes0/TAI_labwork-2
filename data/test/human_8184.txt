The PBR Global Cup is a bull riding team competition that was developed in 2017 by the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) organization, which intends to give the winning country the ability to say they have the best bull riders. Previously, there was a similar team event called the PBR World Cup that the PBR ran from 2007 to 2010, but this new event is not a continuation of the previous one. The PBR Global Cup consists of teams from five countries. It includes these countries:  Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and the United States. A different country holds the team event each year as this is an annual event. The host country does retain a competitive advantage. The best riders in each team are matched against the best riders from other teams. The contest is a series that continues until one country holds all five pieces of the Global Cup, which includes the horn and the native soil of each nation. Only one country will claim the "Toughest Nation on Dirt."

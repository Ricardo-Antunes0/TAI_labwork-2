The Cameron Inquiry, formerly the Commission of Inquiry into Anti-Semitism and Racism in the Labour Party, is an independent inquiry into allegations of anti-Semitism and racism in the Labour Party. It was announced on 16 April 2016 by Prime Minister David Cameron, with the inquiry to be chaired by Sir Eric Pickles.  The inquiry was announced following a series of incidents which have been linked to anti-Semitic and racist remarks made by members of the Labour Party. These remarks were made both within the party itself, and outside of it, in relation to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The inquiry was also announced in response to claims that Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, had failed to deal with anti-Semitism within his own party.  The inquiry will investigate allegations of anti-Semitism and racism both within the Labour Party itself, and outside of it, in relation to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

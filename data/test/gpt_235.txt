Carlo Emanuele dei conti Muzzarelli (19 April 1775, Florence â€“ 12 February 1852, Florence) was an Italian art historian and connoisseur who was one of the leading experts of the 18th century.  Muzzarelli was born in Florence, the son of the sculptor Carlo Muzzarelli. He initially followed his father's career, becoming a sculptor and painter himself. However, he soon developed an interest in art history and began to study ancient art at the University of Pisa. In 1802 he moved to Rome, where he became the librarian at the Vatican Library. In 1814 he was appointed court historian to King Francis I of Austria.  Muzzarelli retired from his position in 1828 but continued to live in Florence until his death. He is most famous for his book "History of Painting", which was published posthumously in 1853.

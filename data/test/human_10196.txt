Gassenhauer nach Hans Neusiedler (1536), commonly known as Gassenhauer , is a short piece from Carl Orff's Schulwerk. As the full title indicates, it is an arrangement of a much older work by the lutenist Hans Neusidler from 1536. It (along with several other pieces) is in fact credited to Orff's longtime collaborator, Gunild Keetman, on at least one recent release of the Schulwerk. As with many other pieces from the Schulwerk, it has been used multiple times on television, radio, music, and in films, including the films Badlands (1973), True Romance (1993) (cover version by Hans Zimmer), Ratcatcher (1999), Finding Forrester (2000), Monster (2003), Michael Moore's Capitalism: A Love Story (2009), The Simpsons′ 22nd-season episode "The Scorpion's Tale" (2011), Friend of the World (2020), and The Simpsons′ 33rd-season episode "Mothers and Other Strangers" (2021). The piece was used as the theme music for an afternoon radio program also titled Gassenhauer on the classical music station WCLV in Cleveland, Ohio, in the 1970s. References

M. E. Sharpe, Inc., an academic publisher, was founded by Myron Sharpe in 1958 with the original purpose of publishing translations from Russian in the social sciences and humanities. These translations were published in a series of journals, the first of which was Problems of Economics, now called Problems of Economic Transition. In the 1960s, the translation project was expanded to include other European languages, then Chinese and later Japanese. Other academic journals launched by M.E. Sharpe during these years featured articles originating in English. At present, the firm publishes over 35 periodicals including Challenge: The Magazine of Economic Affairs, Journal of Management Information Systems, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, Journal of Post-Keynesian Economics and Problems of Post-Communism. Shortly after it was established, M. E. Sharpe, Inc. also began to publish scholarly books in the social sciences and humanities, with a special emphasis on international studies. In the 1980s, the book division was expanded and it currently publishes approximately 60 new titles a year, including works in economics, business, management, public administration, political science, history and literature. Many of M. E. Sharpe's textbooks are available in digital editions through the Sharpe E-Text Center. Several Nobel Prize winners, including Kenzaburō Ōe and Wassily Leontief, are among M. E. Sharpe authors, as is the acclaimed American novelist Howard Fast, author of Spartacus.  The East Gate Books imprint is widely recognized as representing the best in Asian Studies.

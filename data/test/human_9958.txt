9012Live is a concert film featuring the English rock band Yes, recorded at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada on 28 and 29 September 1984 on the band's tour in support of their eleventh studio album, 90125 (1983). It mostly features performances from 90125, which was their highest selling album. The band consists of singer Jon Anderson, guitarist Trevor Rabin, keyboardist Tony Kaye, bassist Chris Squire, and drummer Alan White. The film includes computer special effects from Charlex. 9012Live was released on VHS and aired on MTV in November 1985 as a companion release to the live album 9012Live: The Solos. It was released on DVD in 2006 with bonus footage and a director's cut without the Charlex effects and 1950s stock footage, including an opening and closing clip of the 1952 Edison Electric appliance promotional film series "Young Man's Fancy."  At the end of the concert film credits, the clip from "Young Man's Fancy" has the quote "The Rhythm of Big Generators", which would preview the name of Yes' next album, Big Generator."

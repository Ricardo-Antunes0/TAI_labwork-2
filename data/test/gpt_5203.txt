Tanganyika was a colonial territory in East Africa, now divided between Tanzania and Zaire. The area was named for the Tanganyika river, which forms part of its eastern border.  The territory was established in 1890 as a British protectorate, and became a British colony in 1964. It merged with Zaire to form the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1997, but was restored as a separate country in December 2003.

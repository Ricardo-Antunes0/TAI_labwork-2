An axial flux motor (also known as an axial-flow motor or an axial-piston motor) is a type of electric motor in which the stator is mounted on an axle that is free to rotate, rather than being fixed to the base of the rotor. This allows the overall length of the motor to be shorter and less expensive than a comparable radial-flow motor.  Axial flux motors are used in a wide range of applications, including industrial equipment, transportation, and medical devices. They have several advantages over other types of motors, including lower operating losses and a greater power density.

Bridgegate in Chester, Cheshire, England, forms part of a wider political scandal which has seen the Conservative Party leader, David Cameron, forced to resign. On 19 March 2013, police arrested four individuals, including Cameron's deputy, Andrew Mitchell, on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. The police said that they had obtained video footage which showed Mitchell making remarks about "the black African people" that were "unparliamentary". On 22 July 2013, it was reported that Cameron had been informed about the existence of the video in advance and had requested that it not be made public.

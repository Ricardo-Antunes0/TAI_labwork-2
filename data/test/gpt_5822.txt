Francisco Mago Leccia (“Mago”) was born in 1961 in the village of Pianello dei Greci, located in Calabria, Italy. He is a sculptor whose work is in the permanent collections of many museums, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.  Mago’s sculptures are often site-specific and feature organic forms that reference natural phenomena. His works are characterised by an intuitive sense of dynamics and an acute sense of weight and balance. He has exhibited widely, including at the Venice Biennale, the Whitney Biennial, the São Paulo Art Biennial, and the Triennial of Contemporary Sculpture in Gdansk.  Mago lives and works in Rome.

James E. Schrager is a Clinical Professor of Entrepreneurship and Strategy at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. He studies the use of strategy to help executives predict outcomes and has three times won the Emory Williams Award for Teaching Excellence. He was named by BusinessWeek magazine as one of the top twelve U.S. teachers of entrepreneurship. In 2017, he was given the Faculty Excellence Award at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business to recognize outstanding teaching. Dr. Schrager developed one of the first courses on New Venture Strategy (as opposed to traditional corporate strategy courses). His work is heavily influenced by that of Herbert A. Simon and by the concepts of bounded rationality, which form the basis for his approach to strategy. He co-authored a paper on "Behavioral Strategy: A Foundational View" with Albert Madansky, which developed a set of ideas based on the work of Simon on how strategy decisions are made.  His latest research on strategy decisions is recapped in "Capital Ideas" (Spring 2014), wherein he and co-author Madansky are undertaking human subject experiments to discover how strategic insight can be developed to solve strategy puzzles.

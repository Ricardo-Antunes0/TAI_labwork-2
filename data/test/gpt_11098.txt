Zhao Deyin  (died 892), formally the Prince of Jin, was a military general and political leader who played a pivotal role in the revival of the Tang Dynasty in the late 8th century. He is generally considered to be one of the most accomplished generals in Chinese history.  Zhao Deyin was born in 749, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. He joined the Tang army in 771 and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a general in 781. He participated in many campaigns against the rebel forces led by Huang Chao, and eventually became commander of the eastern troops. In 801, he was made governor of Jiangxi province. In 803, he took part in a successful campaign against Huang Chao's forces at Guangzhou.  In 806, Emperor Xuanzong commissioned Zhao Deyin to lead an army to suppress a rebellion by Shi Langgan, an official under the rule of Emperor Jingzong of Tang. With only 1,000 men, Zhao Deyin easily defeated Shi Langgan's forces and restored order to Jingzong's territories. Emperor Xuanzong subsequently made him the Prince of Jin and gave him more authority.  In 808, Zhao Deyin led an army to suppress a rebellion by Wang Zhen (王真), an official under the rule of Emperor Wenzong of Tang. With only 500 men, Zhao Deyin easily defeated Wang Zhen's forces and restored order to Wenzong's territories. Emperor W

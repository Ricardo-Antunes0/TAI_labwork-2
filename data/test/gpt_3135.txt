WBGU-TV, virtual channel 27 (UHF digital channel 27), is an educational public television station licensed to Bowling Green, Kentucky, United States. The station is owned by the Bowling Green State University Foundation.  WBGU-TV's programming consists primarily of programs produced by the BGSU Television and Radio Department, although it also airs a limited amount of national and international programming. The station's studios are located on the university's campus in Bowling Green, while its transmitter is located atop Mount Zion in northern Warren County.  The station first signed on the air on September 18, 1969 as WKBN-TV. It was the first educational station in Kentucky and the third television station in the state, following WLWT (channel 5) in Cincinnati and WKYT (channel 3) in Lexington. WBGU-TV originally operated as a member station of National Educational Television (NET), which provided programming to stations that were not affiliated with any one network.

In 1990, the university sold WKBN-TV to Kentuckiana Media Group (now Ion Media Networks).

The Oracle Education Foundation is a nonprofit organization funded by Oracle Corporation and staffed by Oracle employees. Its mission is to help young people develop the technical acumen, creative confidence, empathy, and grit to become outstanding designers of solutions to people's needs and the world's problems. In the Foundation's program, Oracle Volunteers coach students through multiday classes at the intersection of design thinking and STEAM disciplinesâ€”science, technology, engineering, art, and math. Students learn coding, electrical engineering, and user-centered design from real practitioners, and then apply their skills and knowledge to prototyping solutions. History The Oracle Education Foundation was founded in 2000. From 2000 to 2003, the Foundation provided hardware grants to public schools in the United States, with significant numbers of students qualifying for free and reduced price school lunches. From 2003 to 2013, the Foundation provided ThinkQuest, a comprehensive online learning platform and annual competition that engaged hundreds of thousands of students and educators globally. Since 2014, the Foundation has provided a program that teaches technology and design thinking.

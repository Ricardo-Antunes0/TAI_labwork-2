Sangili  is a 1982 Indian Tamil-language action drama film, directed by C. V. Rajendran and produced by S. D. Gunasekaran. The film stars Sivaji Ganesan, Prabhu, Sripriya, Major Sundarrajan, Sumithra and M. N. Nambiar. The film had its musical score by M. S. Viswanathan. It is a remake of the 1976 Hindi film Kalicharan. Plot  Inspector-General Sivaraj (Major Sundarrajan) appoints his son and fellow police officer, the talented and steadfast DSP Saravanan Sivaraj(Sivaji Ganesan)as the Special Officer in-charge of tracking down a virulent, anti-national smuggling ring. Saravanan is a widower with two kids who are being raised by his sister Ganga (Sumithra). When Saravanan gets some firm clues that a reputed local businessman and philanthropist 'Lion' Dayanidhi (M. N. Nambiar) could be the king-pin behind the cartel, Dayanidhi has him killed. Soon after, a distraught Sivaraj is introduced by a friend to a ferocious criminal lodged in Vellore prison named Sangili (Sivaji Ganesan's dual role) who remarkably resembles his son Saravanan in appearance. Sivaraj decides to reform and train the brutish Sangili to impersonate Saravanan in order to trace those behind Saravanan's death. Sivaraj finds transforming Sangili a seemingly impossible task as Sangili refuses to mend his ways and has his own agenda of seeking revenge against his sister's murderer, but eventually succeeds with some help from Ganga and Saravanan's kids. Sangili, now transposing as Saravanan, launches himself into tracking the real Saravanan's killers and bringing down the smuggling cartel.

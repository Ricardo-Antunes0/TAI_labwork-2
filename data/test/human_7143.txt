Juan Roget or Joan Roget  (Angoulême, France c.1550 - Aveyron, France? c.1617-1624) was a spectacle maker in Girona, Catalonia, Spain who has been cited as a possible inventor of the telescope. Biography Juan Roget was born in Angoulême, France, and was the son of a cloth carder Ramón Roget. According to the Catalan optometrist and amateur historian Simón de Guilleuma, Juan was married to Joana of Malaville, France, and migrated to the city of Girona, Principality of Catalonia, Spain, where he worked as a master spectacle maker. His brother Pere Roget, also a spectacle maker, settled in Barcelona by the Plaça del Blat and two of Pere's children also became master spectacle makers. The register of deaths of Rodez Cathedral in Aveyron list the death of Joana Roget as August 7, 1614. There is no register record of Juan Roget's death but the register book for deaths between 1617 and 1624 is missing, giving him a probable death date between those two dates.

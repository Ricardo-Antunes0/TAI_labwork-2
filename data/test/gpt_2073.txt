In formal ontology, a branch of metaphysics, mereotopology is the study of the properties and relations of wholes that are not parts of any larger structure.  Mereotopology is a relatively new subfield of ontology, which emerged in the 1990s. It is concerned with studying the properties and relations of wholes that are not parts of any larger structure. This includes things like individual objects, groups of objects, and entire universes.  Mereotopology has a few important applications. One is in the field of artificial intelligence. Researchers in this field use mereotopology to create models of intelligence that can be used to simulate or predict how intelligent beings might behave.  Another application is in the fields of law and ethics. Mereotopologists study legal concepts like ownership and liability, and ethical concepts like rights and duties. They usemereotopology to find ways to apply these concepts to situations that haven't been explicitly covered by law or ethics.  One final application is in the fields of architecture and engineering. Mereotopologists study how physical structures like buildings and bridges interact with their surrounding environment. They usemereotopology to help design more efficient and sustainable physical systems.

Inge Auerbacher (born December 31, 1934, in Kippenheim) is a German-born American chemist.  She is a survivor of the Holocaust and has published many books about her experiences in the Second World War. Early life  When Inge was just 7 years old, she was deported with her parents to the Theresienstadt ghetto in Czechoslovakia. When they arrived, everything they had with them was taken, except for the clothes they were wearing, and Inge's doll, Marlene. Conditions in the concentration camp were very harsh. People were sick and hungry. Potatoes were considered to be as valuable as diamonds. Food was scarce in the camp, Inge was hungry, scared and sick most of the time. Her parents always tried to do what they could for her, with the circumstances they were faced with. For her eighth birthday, her parents gave her a tiny potato cake with a little bit of sugar; for her ninth birthday, an outfit sewn from rags for her doll; and for her tenth birthday, a poem written by her mother.

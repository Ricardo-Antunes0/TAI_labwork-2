The quray (Bashkir ҡурай, Tatar quray, ) is a bowed stringed instrument from the region around the Ural Mountains. The quray is a bowed instrument with two strings in the same length, played by plucking with the fingers.  The quray is believed to have originated in the Bashkir people, who live in the Ural Mountains region. The quray is sometimes called a "bashkir guitar", but it is not a true guitar because it does not have frets. The quray is similar to the kokh (a bowed stringed instrument from the Caucasus), but is more closely related to the shamisen, a Japanese double-stringed acoustic instrument.

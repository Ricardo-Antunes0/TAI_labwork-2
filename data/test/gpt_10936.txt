Phyllis Gaynell Bolds (born Phyllis Allen; January 8, 1939) is an American singer and songwriter. She is best known for her 1968 single "I Will Follow Him", which peaked at number one on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart.   Bolds was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and began her career as a gospel singer in the late 1950s. She later moved to Los Angeles and recorded for several labels before achieving success with "I Will Follow Him". The song was written by Bolds and her then-husband, songwriter and producer Jerry Leiber, and it was produced by Leiber and Mike Stoller. The single topped the charts in both the United States and Canada, becoming one of the biggest-selling singles of 1968. It also reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. After "I Will Follow Him" reached its peak on the charts, Bolds released two more singles – "Love Letters" and "I'm Comin' Home" – but they failed to chart.   Bolds retired from music in 1972 and later moved to Tucson, Arizona. She has since written several books and autobiography, as well as performing occasional concerts. In 2012, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.

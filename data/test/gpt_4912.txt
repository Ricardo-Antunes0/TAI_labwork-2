Modular constructivism is a style of sculpture and architecture that emerged in the late twentieth century. It is characterized by the use of modular units to create structures that are both visually and structurally complex.  Modular constructivism was first developed in the late 1960s by Danish architect JÃ¸rn Utzon, who used modular pieces to create the Sydney Opera House. Since then, the style has been used by a variety of architects and artists, most notably Zaha Hadid. Modular constructivism has been criticized for its reliance on geometrical shapes and lack of organicism, but it has also been praised for its innovative approach to structure and design.

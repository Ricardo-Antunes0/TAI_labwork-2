All six boats were lost in combat.  The SM UC-60 was designed as a Type UC II submarine, but only six were ultimately converted to that type. The SM UC-60 was one of the most advanced submarines of its time, and it was intended as a replacement for the earlier Type UC I boats. However, its poor performance led to its poor reputation among Nazi commanders. The SM UC-60 was lost in all six of its combat missions.

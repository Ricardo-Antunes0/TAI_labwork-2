Electro-oxidation (EO), also known as anodic oxidation, is a process in which electrons are transferred from an anode to a cathode by an electric current. The anode and cathode can be either solid or liquid, and the process occurs in an electrolyte.  EO is used in the production of electricity, in particular in the production of aluminum and magnesium alloys. It is also used in the production of ferrous materials, such as steel. EO is also used in various chemical processes.

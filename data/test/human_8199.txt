The Decamentathlon is a multi disciplined games event that was created as part of the first Mind Sports Olympiad. It was founded to try to find the best games all-rounder in the world and hence possibly the best games player. It was given a prize fund of Â£10,000 for the inaugural competition, that equalled that of the highest funded event at the first MSO sponsored by Skandia.  However, the other events were spread over multiple playing sessions whereas the Decamentathlon was held over just a single session. This event was initially hailed as the MSO flagship event. Although, the Mind Sports Olympiad's other new event the Pentamind  has since become regarded as the more significant event despite not having a fixed format. Format  The Mind Sports Olympiad was described as the Olympics of the mind. The Decamentathlon and Pentamind were an attempt to replicate the ideas of the decathlon and pentathlon from athletics. Unlike the Pentamind which has a free format allowing competitors to use different events to each other, the Decamentathlon has a fixed format. The Decamentathlon comprises a 4-hour test which is split into 10 events (see below). Each event was either a reduced version of the full event when played in competition or a written paper. Each event carries a maximum score of 100 points so the maximum possible score is 1000 points. The complexity of setting the event and marking it  has meant that the only place to have held a Decamentathlon is the Mind Sports Olympiad where the annual world championship is held.

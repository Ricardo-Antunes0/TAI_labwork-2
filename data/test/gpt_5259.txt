A schneekragen (German for snow collar) or snood is a type of neckwear popular in the Middle Ages and Early Modern periods. Schneekragen are made from a single piece of cloth, usually white, that is folded in half and sewn up the back to form a loop. They are then worn over a shirt or tunic and secured at the front with a brooch or a clasp. Schneekragen are also known by their French name chapeau de neige.

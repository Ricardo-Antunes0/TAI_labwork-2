Amateur geology or rock collecting (also referred to as "digging") is the collecting of rocks and minerals for personal use, typically for the purpose of identification or pleasure.  The practice of amateur geology began in the early 1800s with pioneers such as John Jacob Astor, William Peabody and James Marshall. In 1829, amateur geologist and mineralogist Edward Ormerod discovered a new mineral species in Cornwall, England. The first systematic collecting of rocks and minerals by amateurs took place in the 1840s. The 1848 publication of a guide to the collection of rocks and minerals by George F. Kunz led to a flowering of amateur rock collecting in North America.  Amateur geology can be divided into several categories: field collecting, rockhounding, mineralogy, petrology and stoneworking. Field collecting is the most common form of amateur geology and involves the gathering of rocks and minerals during outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, or hunting. Rockhounding is the search for specific types of rocks or minerals in nature. Mineralogy involves the study of the chemical makeup of rocks and minerals. Petrology studies the origins, evolution and behavior of rocks and minerals. Stoneworking is the art of making stone objects from natural stones.

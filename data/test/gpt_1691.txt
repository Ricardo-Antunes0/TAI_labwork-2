Potton Island is a sparsely populated island located in the Atlantic Ocean about off the coast of North Carolina. The island is about long and wide, with a land area of . The highest point on the island is atop Mount Airy, at above sea level.  The island was first settled by Europeans in the early 17th century, when English colonists from Virginia established a small colony there. The colony failed, and the island remained uninhabited for much of the 18th century. In the early 19th century, a group of Scotsmen settled on the island and began to farm and trade with local Native Americans. The island remained largely rural until the early 20th century, when it began to experience a rapid growth in population as a result of its close proximity to major cities on mainland North Carolina. Today, Potton Island is a relatively small but growing community with a population of about 150 people.

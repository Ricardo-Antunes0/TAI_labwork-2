Mustelidae is a family of mammals in the order Carnivora. The family contains the weasels, otters, and ferrets. Mustelids are generally small to medium-sized animals, with short legs and long snouts. They have strong jaws and teeth, and are able to climb well.  Mustelids are found all over the world, except for Antarctica. They are mainly terrestrial animals, but some species are able to swim. Most mustelids live in cold environments, but a few species live in warm climates. They are generally solitary animals, but some species live in packs.

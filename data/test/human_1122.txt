Bibigul Akhmetkyzy Tulegenova (, Bibıgül Ahmetqyzy Tölegenova; born 16 December 1929) is a Soviet-Kazakh opera singer (lyric and coloratura soprano), actress and teacher. Among her awards are Hero of Socialist Labor (1991), People's Artist of the USSR (1967), and the USSR State Prize (1970). Early life   Tulegenova was born in Semipalatinsk (modern Semey, East Kazakhstan region of Kazakhstan). She grew up in a musical family. Her father loved to play the violin and her Tatar mother sang. In 1937, her father was arrested in Katon-Karagai and disappeared. In 1946, while studying in seventh grade evening school, she went to work at a meat processing plant, where she could sing in an Amateur circle. The young singer drew the attention of writer Galina Serebryakova, who was in Semipalatinsk in exile. She took custody of Tulegenova, and gave her the first music lessons. At Serebryakova's insistence, Bibigul entered the vocal and choral faculty of the Kazan Conservatory in Alma-ata, where she studied under N. N. Samyshina and from which she graduated in 1954. In 1951, she worked as a soloist on the Kazakh radio, where she performed folk and pop songs.

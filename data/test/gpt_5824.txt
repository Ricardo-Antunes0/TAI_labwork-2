The Federal Street District is a residential neighborhood in the Central Business District of Providence, Rhode Island. The district is bounded on the north by Washington Street, on the east by Exchange Place, on the south by Myrtle Avenue and on the west by Westminster Street.  The Federal Street District was developed in the early 19th century as a residential area for wealthy merchants and professionals. It was designated a historic district in 1984 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. The district is now primarily composed of late 19th century and early 20th century rowhouses, although there are a few early 20th century apartment buildings and some 20th century commercial buildings. Most of the rowhouses are three or four stories tall, with granite or stonework facades and cast iron railing around their front porches. The district is notable for its well-preserved architecture and its high degree of architectural uniformity.

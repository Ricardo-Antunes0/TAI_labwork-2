Plascore Incorporated manufactures honeycomb core, cleanrooms, and composite panels marketed under the brand Plascore. Honeycomb is used in aerospace, marine, military, safety, transportation, and other applications. When honeycomb is sandwiched between two surfaces, it effectively creates a distance between the two surfaces more or less like an I-beam. The resulting composite structure exhibits a high strength-to-weight ratio and shear strength. Shear strength is the measured ability of a material to resist structural failure. Plascore honeycomb is designed to increase shear strength while adding minimal additional weight. Plascore is a global organization, with a 185,000 sq. ft. headquarters and three additional manufacturing facilities in Zeeland, Michigan. Those three facilities are 50,000, 40,000 and 80,000 sq. ft. in size. The company also has an 85,000 sq. ft. manufacturing plant in Waldlaubersheim, Germany; and sales offices throughout the world. Plascore is AS/EN/JISQ9100,  ISO 14001:2004, and ISO 9001:2008 Certified, and the company's PP Honeycomb has received a Lloyds Register Certificate of Approval of a Core Material. Plascore is also AS9100 certified, an industry standard required by the majority of major aircraft manufacturers that provides verification of consistent aerospace product quality. History Plascore was founded in 1977 as a manufacturer of honeycomb core sold to various value added manufacturers. By the 1980s, Plascoreâ€™s product development and manufacturing capabilities led the company into value-added markets, including cleanroom walls, ceiling and door systems for semi-conductor and pharmaceutical sectors; panels for transportation products and building materials and energy absorbers for various markets.

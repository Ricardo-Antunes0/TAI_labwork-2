The pGLO plasmid is an engineered plasmid used in biotechnology as a vector for creating genetically modified organisms.  The plasmid contains several reporter genes, most notably the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the ampicillin resistance gene.  GFP was isolated from the jelly fish Aequorea victoria. Because it shares a bidirectional promoter with a gene for metabolizing arabinose, the GFP gene is expressed in the presence of arabinose, which makes the transgenic organism express its fluorescence under UV light.  GFP can be induced in bacteria containing the pGLO plasmid by growing them on +arabinose plates. pGLO is made by Bio-Rad Laboratories. Structure  pGLO is made up of three genes that are joined together using recombinant DNA technology. They are as follows: Bla, which codes for the enzyme beta-lactamase giving the transformed bacteria resistance to the beta-lactam family of antibiotics (such as of the penicillin family) araC, a promoter region that regulates the expression of GFP (specifically, the GFP gene will be expressed only in the presence of arabinose) GFP, the green fluorescent protein, which gives a green glow if cells produce this type of protein

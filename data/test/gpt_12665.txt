The Mulford Biological Exploration of the Amazon was a scientific expedition led by the American naturalist John Muir in 1883.  Muir and his team traveled down the length of the Amazon River, from its headwaters in the Andes to its mouth at the Atlantic Ocean. The expedition was a watershed event in the history of American exploration and conservation, as it laid the groundwork for later expeditions that explored more extensively and documented more species of plants and animals in the Amazon rainforest.

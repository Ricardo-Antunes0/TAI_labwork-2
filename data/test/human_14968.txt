Literal Latte is a quarterly literary journal based in New York City and edited by Jenine Gordon Bockman. It was founded in June 1994 by Jenine Gordon Bockman and Jeffrey Michael Gordon Bockman.  The journal published its last print edition in July 2003, but has continuously maintained an online version since November 1996. A comprehensive re-design of the site was launched in November 2008, designed and developed by Tyler C. Gore, who has also served as art director and editor since that time. Among serious, non-commercial literary journals, Literal Latte took an atypical approach to publication and distribution: instead of the customary "perfect bound" journal format, Literal Latte was printed on newsprint in tabloid format.  The relatively low cost of printing on newsprint made it economical for the publishers to distribute the magazine for free at bookstores, universities, and newsstands throughout New York City, thus achieving an unusually high circulation rate for a literary magazine—as high as 30,000 copies per issue, according to the publishers—as well as attracting local and (eventually) national advertisers, offsetting the cost of production.

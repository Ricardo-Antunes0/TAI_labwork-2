The Straitjacket Lottery is a 2004 film written and directed by Peter Jackson.  The film is set in a small town in New Zealand, where the inhabitants are obsessed with the lottery. The only problem is that no one has won the lottery in years.  Jackson decided to make a film about the lottery because he was tired of people talking about it without any real understanding of what it was. The Straitjacket Lottery is a dark and twisted look at the human mind, and Jackson has said that he wanted to make a film that would make people think.  The Straitjacket Lottery was released in theaters on July 22, 2004, and received mixed reviews. Some critics praised Jackson's dark vision, while others found the film too difficult to follow. However, the Straitjacket Lottery still managed to earn over $38 million at the box office.

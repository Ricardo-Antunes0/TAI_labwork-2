Development-supported agriculture is a nascent movement in which farmers receive financial and technical assistance from organizations or governments in order to increase agricultural production. The goals of development-supported agriculture are to improve food security, reduce poverty, and create jobs.  Development-supported agriculture was first developed in the 1970s by the World Bank and the International Development Association. The aim of the program was to help farmers in developing countries increase their production by providing them with technical assistance and cash subsidies. Development-supported agriculture has since been expanded to include a variety of different programs, including crop insurance, value-added products, and agroforestry.  Development-supported agriculture has been criticized for its lack of efficacy. Many critics argue that the programs do not help farmers enough to make a significant contribution to global food security and that they are often too expensive for small farmers to use. However, advocates of development-supported agriculture argue that it is a valuable tool that can help farmers in developing countries increase their production and improve their livelihoods.

Margaret Alford was a pioneering woman classicist and professor of Latin at the University of Cambridge. She published extensively on Latin poetry, and is most notable for her translations of Horace.  Born in London in 1878, Alford studied classics at Girton College, Cambridge, graduating with a first in 1903. She then worked as a teacher before becoming a full professor of Latin at Cambridge in 1934. During her time at Cambridge, Alford was responsible for establishing the university's Latin department, and she also served as president of the Classical Association from 1941 to 1943. In 1945 she was made a Companion of Honour. Alford retired from her professorship in 1959, but continued to work until her death in 1967.

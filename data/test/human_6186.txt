Janua linguarum reserata (English: The Door of Languages Unlocked, often mistranslated as The Gate of Languages and the like) is a textbook written by John Amos Comenius in 1629.  It was published in 1631 in Leszno and was soon translated into most European languages. Background  In 1628, when the Habsburgs allowed only the Catholic religion in their monarchy, many Czech Brethren found exile in Leszno, in Catholic Poland, where Protestants were tolerated. Comenius formed the idea that language cannot be taught without relation to things. He also saw a narrow connection between language and knowledge, both of which he considered limited. His friends persuaded him to express these ideas in books, of which Janua linguarum reserata was the first. Comenius was inspired by a Latin-Spanish textbook called Janua linguarum, published in Salamanca in 1611 by a Hibernian monk William Bathe (or Bateus). The book was published in 1617 in London in four languages (the other two being English and French). This edition was probably shown to Comenius by John Jonston.

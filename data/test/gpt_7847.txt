The Committee of Seventy is an independent, non-partisan, international organization of distinguished citizens who are dedicated to promoting religious freedom and the rule of law.  The Committee of Seventy was founded in 1945 by seven members of the United States Congress, who were alarmed by the growth of totalitarianism and communism in Europe. The organization's goal is to promote religious freedom and the rule of law around the world. The Committee has played a leading role in many important human rights cases, including the defense of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia and the persecution of Christians in Iran.  The Committee is composed of seventy members, each of whom is selected for his or her distinction in fields such as arts, sciences, government, business, and law. Selection is based on merit rather than political affiliation. The Committee meets twice a year to discuss pressing issues affecting religious freedom and the rule of law.

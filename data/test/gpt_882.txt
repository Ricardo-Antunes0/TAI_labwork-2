Quantum error correction (QEC) is used in error detection and correction (EDC) protocols for bulk data storage and transmission. In QEC, a qubit is used as a unit of quantum information, and its errors are corrected using a symmetric-key algorithm.  Quantum error correction is an essential part of any ECC protocol used for bulk data storage and transmission. In QEC, a qubit is used as a unit of quantum information, and its errors are corrected using a symmetric-key algorithm. The resulting system is generally more error-tolerant than systems that use classical techniques to correct errors.  There are several reasons why quantum error correction is advantageous over classical techniques. First, classical algorithms are limited by the speed of the communication channel between the error-correcting nodes. In contrast, quantum algorithms can be run on distant nodes without any delay, which makes them more robust against channel failures. Second, classical algorithms require a perfect knowledge of the state of the system at every node; this requirement is impossible to satisfy in practice. In contrast, Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) can be applied to a qubit without requiring this knowledge, which makes it more robust against noise and errors. Finally, classical algorithms require a large amount of computational resources to implement; Quantum Error Correction (QEC) can be implemented very efficiently using existing computer hardware.

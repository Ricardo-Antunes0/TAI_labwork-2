The Interaction Design Foundation (IxDF) is an international non-profit organization that promotes and supports the practice of interaction design. IxDF was founded in 2006 by HÃ¥kan Samuelsson, Jakob Nielsen, and Jens Neubert with the goal of advancing the field of interaction design through research, education, and advocacy.  Interaction design is the process of designing products, services, and experiences that allow people to interact with each other. It encompasses a wide range of disciplines, including human-computer interaction (HCI), electronic product design (EPD), information design, product management, psychology, and sociology.  The IxDF facilitates the exchange of ideas and resources between its members and the wider community. Its flagship publication is the quarterly journal "Interaction". The IxDF also organizes events including the annual Interaction Design Conference (IDC) and workshops around the world.

The Project-Level Aid (PLAID) database has now been operational for over two years and supports a wide range of development interventions at the project level. The aim of the PLAID database is to provide a platform for the sharing of effective project-level aid interventions by practitioners and researchers.  Project-level aid (PLAID) is an umbrella term that refers to all forms of assistance given to development projects at the project level. This includes both financial and non-financial assistance, as well as technical assistance.  The PLAID database is a resource tool that has been designed to support practitioners and researchers who are interested in learning about effective project-level aid interventions. It contains information on over 1,450 development interventions from around the world. This information is searchable and can be accessed by keyword or by country.  The PLAID database has been developed in collaboration with a number of organisations, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the United Nations Development Programme. It is aimed at helping to improve the quality and efficiency of development assistance at the project level.

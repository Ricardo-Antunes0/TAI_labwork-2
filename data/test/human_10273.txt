A flat spot, or wheel flat, also called spalling or shelling, is a fault in railroad wheel shape.  A flat spot occurs when a rail vehicle's wheelset is dragged along the rail after the wheel/axle has stopped rotating. Flat spots are usually caused by use of the emergency brake, or slip and slide conditions that causes wheels to lock up while the train is still moving. Flat spots are more common in the autumn and winter when the rails are slippery. Flat spots can also be caused by faulty brakes or wheelset bearings. Consequences If the flat spot is very small, the rail vehicle will be able to continue being used. The fault is removed later in the wheelset turning process, using a wheel lathe. However, because of the heat suffered while being dragged along the rail and the impacts suffered afterward, these wheels are more likely to break due to changes in the alloy structure.

He began studying painting in his twenties and became one of the most acclaimed painters of his time. Although his paintings are often classified as realistic or naturalistic, they are also highly stylized and often infused with Buddhist and Taoist elements.  Zhu Shugui is best known for his paintings of landscapes and seascapes, which are characterized by their intense realism and use of light and color to evoke moods. He is also well-known for his poetry, which is typically simple and lyrical. Zhu Shugui died in 1683 at the age of 72.

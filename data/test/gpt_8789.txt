Operation Fair Play was the code name for a proposed military operation by NATO in response to the Yugoslav Wars. The name is derived from the Fair Play for Sport campaign, which was a part of the United Nations' anti-apartheid efforts.  Operation Fair Play was first proposed by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1987. The plan called for a NATO peacekeeping force to be sent to help broker a ceasefire and prevent further bloodshed in the Yugoslav Wars. However, the proposal was met with opposition from many member countries, who feared that an intervention would lead to further bloodshed and instability.  Ultimately, Operation Fair Play was never put into action. Instead, NATO focused its efforts on backing up the fledgling UN peacekeeping force in Yugoslavia, known as UNPROFOR. The operation lasted until 1995, when a final peace agreement was reached between the warring factions in Yugoslavia.

The Chu–Han Contention  or Chu–Han War was a civil war fought by the states of Chu and Han in the late 4th century BC. The war is also known as the War of the Nine Armies, because it involved nine of the ten provinces in ancient China.  The cause of the war is unknown, but it may have been caused by Chu's attempt to increase its power at the expense of Han. Chu won the war and consolidated its power, although Han retained some influence.

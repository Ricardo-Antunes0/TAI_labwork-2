The episode starts off with a nightmare in which Rachel is drastically unprepared for the opening night, then is heckled by her former high school tormentors and supported by her New York friends in a performance of "Lovefool". She falls and is surrounded by everyone, booing her. At breakfast, Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) bans her from going on the Internet and reading the negative reviews, taking away her phone until opening night.

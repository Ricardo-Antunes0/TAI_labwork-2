is a 2001 survival horror game developed and published by Konami for the PlayStation. It is the sequel to the game Silent Hill, and is based on the hit 1996 American horror film of the same name. The game was directed by Akira Yamaoka and written by Christophe Gans and Patrick Lussier.  Set ten years after the events of the first game, Harry Mason has returned to his home town of Silent Hill to find it in ruins. He is then attacked by a monster that he believes is from his memories, and soon discovers that Silent Hill is home to otherworldly creatures that have come to life.  The player must use Harry's survival instincts and weapons to fight their way through twisted corridors, deadly traps and monstrous enemies in order to find a way out of Silent Hill. The game features a unique "healing meter" which slowly regenerates over time but can also be restored by using health items or using magic spells. If the meter runs out, Harry will become incapacitated and may die if not saved in time.  Silent Hill 2 was met with critical acclaim upon release, receiving praise for its atmospheric graphics, well-written story, compelling characters and challenging gameplay. It has since been considered one of the greatest horror games ever made, and has been praised for its innovative use of suspenseful atmosphere and fear.

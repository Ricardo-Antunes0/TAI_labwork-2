Hangleton Manor Inn, the adjoining Old Manor House and associated buildings form a bar and restaurant complex in Hangleton, an ancient village (and latterly a 20th-century housing estate) which is part of the English city of Brighton and Hove.  The manor house is the oldest secular building in the Hove part of the city; some 15th-century features remain, and there has been little change since the High Sheriff of Sussex rebuilt it in the mid-16th century.  Local folklore asserts that a 17th-century dovecote in the grounds has been haunted since a monk placed a curse on it.  The buildings that comprise the inn were acquired by Hangleton Manor Ltd in 1968, and converted to an inn under the Whitbread banner. The brewery company Hall & Woodhouse have owned and operated it since 2005.  English Heritage has listed the complex at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance, and the dovecote is listed separately at Grade II. History The manor of Hangleton has Saxon origins.  At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, it was owned by William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey and held by another Norman nobleman, William de Wateville. He was the tenant of several manors in the area, including Bristelmestune (present-day Brighton). The parish of Hangleton covered  of the South Downs northwest of Brighton, and consisted mostly of grazing land and chalk downland.  Its three main features were on a northeastâ€“southwest alignment: to the northeast, a small village; to the southwest of this, the medieval St Helen's Church and a small pond; and further southwest, the manor house. The village suffered depopulation in the medieval period (perhaps because of greater enclosure for sheep farming, a fire or, most likely, the Black Death). A survey in 1603 recorded only one house in the parish (other than Hangleton Manor and another manor house at Benfields, towards the southwest corner of the parish), and as late as 1931 the population was only 109.

The Martin P4M Mercator was a maritime reconnaissance aircraft used by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during the Second World War.  The P4M Mercator was a development of the earlier Martin P3M Marlin aircraft. It was a single-seat, high-wing monoplane with a fixed undercarriage and a conventional tailwheel landing gear. The aircraft was powered by a single engine, a Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp radial air-cooled engine.  The P4M Mercator entered service with the RAAF in 1941. It served throughout the war, participating in numerous bombing and reconnaissance missions over enemy territory. After the war, the P4M Mercator remained in service with the RAAF as a trainer aircraft. The last example was retired from service in 1960.

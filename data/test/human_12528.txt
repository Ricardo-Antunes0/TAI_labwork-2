Drakaea thynniphila, commonly known as narrow-lipped hammer orchid is a species of orchid endemic to the southâ€“west of Western Australia. It is pollinated by a single species of male thynnid wasp using sexual deception. The orchid's labellum is similar in shape and scent to a flightless female thynnid wasp. It is one of the more common drakaeas and is easily distinguished from the other species. The tiny lumps on its leaf along with the long flower that lacks a swollen labellum are diagnostic. Description  Drakaea thynniphila is similar to others in the genus in that it has a single, ground hugging leaf and an underground tuber. In this case, the leaf is heart shaped, about  in diameter, covered with tiny raised lumps, fairly glossy dark green with darker lines radiating from the attachment to the stem. The stem is  long and the stalk of the single flower is  long.

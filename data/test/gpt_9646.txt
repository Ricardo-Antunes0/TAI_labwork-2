Glenn Rhee is a fictional character from the American television series "The Walking Dead", which is based on the comic book series of the same name. He is a main character and the de facto leader of the group of survivors known as "The Hilltop". He is a former United States Army lieutenant colonel and staff officer who, in the show's first season, is employed by the Alexandria Safe-Zone as its chief of security.  Rhee was born on October 22, 1978, in Atlanta, Georgia. He enlisted in the United States Army after high school, serving for ten years before being discharged as a lieutenant colonel. Rhee then attended George Washington University, where he earned a degree in political science and international relations.  Rhee first appears in the series' second season as one of the survivors who travel to Alexandria Safe-Zone along with Michonne and Andrea. He initially clashes with Michonne, but over time they develop a mutual respect for each other. Rhee quickly becomes the de facto leader of the group, which grows to include over fifty people. In the fourth season, Rhee leads a raid on an abandoned prison in order to free Negan and his followers. The raid goes poorly, and Rhee is captured by Negan's forces. He is later killed by Lucille while being tortured.

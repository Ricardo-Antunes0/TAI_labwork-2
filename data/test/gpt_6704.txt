Barnstaple ( or ) is a river-port town and civil parish in North Devon, England, on the east bank of the River Dart. The town is situated about 8 miles (13 km) south of the city of Exeter and about 30 miles (48 km) north-west of Plymouth. Barnstaple is on the A390 road which links the two main cities of Devon, Plymouth and Exeter.  Barnstaple's recorded history stretches back to the Iron Age when a settlement was established at the mouth of the River Dart. In Roman times it was known as "Iscana" or "Isca Dumnoniorum". The town grew up around an ancient market cross which became the focal point for trade in the area. The town's charter was granted by King John in 1202, and its first mayor was elected in 1205. Barnstaple became a borough in 1247 and was granted a Royal Charter by King Henry III in 1284.  The town's medieval architecture can be seen in its churches, including All Saints, which dates from the 12th century, and St Mary Magdalene, which was rebuilt in 1430 after being destroyed by fire. In 1632 a tornado destroyed much of Barnstaple. The town's main attraction today is its market place, which is situated on the banks of the River Dart.  Barnstaple is home to several museums, including the Museum of Devon and Cornwall, which has exhibits on Devon history; and Barnstaple Museum,

Leonard McNally (1752â€“1820), sometimes spelled MacNally or McNally, was an Irish-born Presbyterian minister who became a leading figure in the early days of the American Presbyterian Church.  Born in County Derry, McNally was educated at the University of Glasgow and the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). He served as a minister in the Scottish Presbyterian Church before moving to Philadelphia in 1785. There, he helped to found the First Presbyterian Church, which became one of the largest Presbyterian churches in America.

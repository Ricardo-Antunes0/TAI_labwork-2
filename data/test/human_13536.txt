Michael A. Hicks (born 1948) is an English historian, specialising on the history of late medieval England, in particular the Wars of the Roses, the nature of late medieval society, and the kings and nobility of the period. Education and academic career Hicks studied under Charles Ross while a final-year undergraduate student at the University of Bristol (1969–70), T. B. Pugh for his M.A. at Southampton (1971), and C. A. J. Armstrong for his DPhil. at the University of Oxford (1975), which he had originally began under J. R. L. Highfield. In his own words, his research was – and remained – firmly placed within "the school of history founded by the late K. B. McFarlane ... the Master" although with a heavy "biographical bent". His first published article, however, was on an aspect of law in the seventeenth century. Having worked for the Victoria County History project between 1974 and 1978, he joined King Alfred's College, Winchester, later the University of Winchester. A proposed joint paper with his former tutor, Charles Ross, on bastard feudalism had come to nothing by 1978, and a suggestion by Gerald Harriss for a joint study with Christine Carpenter, Michael Hicks and himself "foundered on [their] incompatible points of view".

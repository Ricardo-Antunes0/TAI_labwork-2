"Radio Lover" is a murder ballad by American country music artist George Jones.  It was composed by Curly Putman, Ron Hellard, and Bucky Jones. Although it was released as a single in 1989, it was included earlier in the 1983 album Jones Country. Background "Radio Lover" is a murder ballad, playing on a recurring theme in country music: A husband who is frequently absent, the wife becoming unfaithful (due to loneliness and desperation for physical intimacy), the husband returning home unannounced to find his wife in the arms of another man and - in a fit of rage - killing both his wife and the man who was with her. This storyline has been used in several songs, including "Miller's Cave" by Jack Clement (recorded by Hank Snow in 1960 and Bobby Bare in 1964), "The Snakes Crawl at Night" by Charley Pride, "The Cold, Hard Facts of Life" by Porter Wagoner and "Blood Red and Goin' Down" by Tanya Tucker, as well as the later song "Papa Loved Mama" by Garth Brooks.

Joseph Jordan (born 15 December 1951) is a Scottish football player, coach and manager. He is currently a first team coach at AFC Bournemouth. A former striker, he played for Leeds United, Manchester United, and Milan, among others at club level, as well making 52 appearances and scoring 11 goals for Scotland. As a player, he gained a fearsome 'Jaws' persona due to having lost two front teeth early in his career. The persona aside, he became known as a strong, fearless and committed player, with skill to match, and good aerial abilities. He was part of the successful Leeds United team of the 1970s, winning the 1973â€“74 Football League First Division title. Cup success was elusive however, being a losing finalist with Leeds in the 1973 European Cup Winners' Cup Final and 1975 European Cup Final, and the 1979 FA Cup Final with Manchester United. At international level he is the only Scottish player to score in three World Cups, in 1974, 1978 and 1982.

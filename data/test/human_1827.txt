Mail order is the buying of goods or services by mail delivery. The buyer places an order for the desired products with the merchant through some remote methods such as:  Sending an order form in the mail   Placing a telephone call  Placing an order with a few travelling agents and paying by instalments   Filling in a form on a website or mobile app â€” if the product information is also mainly obtained online rather than via a paper catalogue or via television, this model is online shopping or e-commerce Then, the products are delivered to the customer. The products are usually delivered directly to an address supplied by the customer, such as a home address, but occasionally the orders are delivered to a nearby retail location for the customer to pick up. Some merchants also allow the goods to be shipped directly to a third party consumer, which is an effective way to send a gift to an out-of-town recipient. Some merchants delivered the goods directly to the customer via their travelling agents.

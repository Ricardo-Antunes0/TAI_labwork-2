In October 2010 the stable turned tecnico for the first time. In 2015 Dark Ozz and Espiritu left AAA and Cuervo and Scoria reformed the Black Family. History The Black Family was created in 2000 when Charly Manson, Chessman Escoria and Cuervo were teamed up to form a rudo (Heel or "bad guy") group that shared a Goth-inspired look, reflected in their ring clothes and painted faces. In 2001 the masked wrestler Path Finder was repackaged as Ozz and joined the Black Family following a career threatening injury to Charly Manson that forced him out of the ring for several months. In late 2001 Charly Manson returned  while still not fully recovered, and began a war of words with the Black Family as Chessman had taken over his leadership role in Manson's absence. The storyline did not develop further as Manson left AAA altogether. When Chessman took over leadership of the group the Black Family joined Lucha Libre Latina (LLL), the Mexican version of the New World Order, a group led by Chessman's long time friend Cibernético. Even though they were part of a much larger group the four men still worked as a unit, a stable within the stable.

Resistencia  is the capital and largest city of the province of Chaco, Argentina. Located in the northwest of the province, it is the main commercial and industrial center of the area. Resistencia has a population of about 244,000 inhabitants.  The city was founded on February 15, 1840 by José María Aguirre, as a military outpost in response to the Juan Manuel de Rosas' intention to annex the Chaco region. The first inhabitants were soldiers and their families from Entre Ríos Province.   In 1853, Resistencia became the capital of the Chaco Province. It grew rapidly in importance because it was located at the intersection of two important trade routes: one leading north to Salta and Corrientes provinces and the other leading east to Paraguay.   The city's economy is based on agriculture, manufacturing, and services. Resistencia is home to several important companies, including Alpargatas (a footwear company), Indupac (a food company), and Gendarmería Nacional (the national police force).   Resistencia is also a major tourist destination thanks to its historical downtown area and its natural attractions, such as Mount Aconcagua and Laguna Blanca National Park.

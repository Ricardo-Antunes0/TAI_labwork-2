Dichomeris melanota is a moth in the Gelechiidae family. It was described by Meyrick in 1913. It is found in India (Assam).  The wingspan is about 9.5Â mm. The forewings are bronzy-black, with a median streak of white irroration, edged anteriorly by a black fascia, posteriorly by a narrow streak of black suffusion from the costa to four-fifths of the dorsum, and with a broad streak of white irroration from the costa before the middle to near the dorsum before the tornus. There is an irregular dorsal blotch of black suffusion before the middle, as well as an irregular streak of white irroration extending along the termen from two-thirds to three-fourths, preceded by a rather large black dot on the costa beyond one-fourth. The hindwings are pale grey.

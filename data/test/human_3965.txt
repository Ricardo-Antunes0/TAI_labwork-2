Operation Highbrow was a British Ministry of Defence (MoD) operation to evacuate civilians from Beirut as a result of the escalating 2006 Lebanon War. Initially, helicopters started ferrying the most vulnerable to Cyprus with several Royal Navy ships later transporting evacuees across the Mediterranean Sea to Cyprus. The operation involved Royal Navy surface ships and helicopters, with Royal Air Force helicopters also providing support and transit. The operation was described as being the largest evacuation that Britain was involved in since Dunkirk. Background On 12 July 2006, in an effort to kill Mohammed Deif, leader of Hamas' Military Wing, Israeli jets bombed a house in Gaza. In retaliation, Hezbollah entered into Israel from Lebanon and killed three Israeli soldiers, taking two hostage. Later that same day, Israeli aircraft struck several targets inside Lebanon including many main roads in the north of the country, and the main runway at Beirut Airport. The UK Government started to work on plans to use either an air or seabridge to evacuate British nationals. Whilst both warring sides attacked each other, Britons were advised to lie-low until the navy ships arrived. People who had considered evacuating to Syria were told stories by those inside Lebanon about how people were killed on the road to the north by the bombings.

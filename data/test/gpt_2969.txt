The Angelic Gospel Singers were an American gospel music group which was active from the early 1960s to the late 1970s. The group consisted of five sisters: Shirley, Joyce, Valerie, Linda, and Pat.  The Angelic Gospel Singers were formed in the early 1960s in Detroit, Michigan. They were originally known as the Five Sisters gospel group, and their debut album was released in 1965. The group enjoyed a successful career throughout the 1970s, and their popularity was helped by their appearances on various TV programmes and concerts. They disbanded in the late 1970s, but they have since reunited and continue to perform gospel music.

The River Corve is a minor river in Shropshire, England. It is a tributary of the River Teme which it joins in the town of Ludlow, and which joins the River Severn at Powick near Worcester. The valley it flows through is known as the Corvedale (or Corve Dale), a term used as a general name for the area, and a name used for example by the primary school in Diddlebury. It is sometimes (archaically) spelled "Corf", which is its pronunciation. Course It flows near Corfton (which it gives its name to), then by Culmington, then through Stanton Lacy and then through the northwest outskirts of Ludlow before joining the Teme in an area of meadows just outside the town. It also gave its name to Corfham Castle, near Peaton. Corfham was the caput (the centre of medieval administration) for two Saxon hundreds that encompassed the Corve Dale â€” Patton and Culvestan. They were merged into a single hundred (Munslow) in the reign of Henry I, however Culvestan continued to be a name used to describe the lower Corve valley for at least a century afterwards.

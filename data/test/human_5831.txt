Various organizations operated streetcars on Parliament street, in Toronto, Ontario.  The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) discontinued scheduled service on Parliament in 1966, when it opened the Bloor-Danforth subway. History In 1874, the Toronto Street Railway opened the Winchester horsecar route, which ran along Carlton Street, turning north a short distance on Parliament Street to Winchester Street. In 1881, this route was extended east on Winchester Street to Sumach Street. In 1881, the TSR opened a second horsecar route on Parliament Street, the Parliament route, running from downtown on Queen Street turning north on Parliament Street then east on Gerrard Street to River Street. After the Toronto Railway Company took over the streetcar system, it electrified both the Winchester and Parliament routes in 1893. The Parliament route name disappeared in 1918 with the tracks between Queen and Gerrard Streets operating as part of the Queen route. Under the TRC, the Winchester route ran with double track on Winchester Street, east to Sackville Street, then further east on a single track to Sumach Street where there was a wye.

William Dunstan, VC (2 March 1895 – 1 December 1944) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to a member of the British or Commonwealth forces.  William Dunstan was born on 2 March 1895 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia to Catherine (née Butler) and John Dunstan. The eldest of six children, he was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne. In 1911, he began an apprenticeship with the electrical engineering firm of W. G. Hume & Co. Ltd., where he worked until 1916, when he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and was posted to the 5th Field Ambulance.  On 9 October 1917 at Beaumont Hamel, France, Private Dunstan demonstrated extraordinary bravery in tending to wounded comrades under heavy fire. He carried out his duties with complete disregard for his safety and was among the first to reach and help a seriously wounded man. Despite being hit by shrapnel several times, he persisted in performing his duties until he collapsed from exhaustion. When another stretcher-bearer became overwhelmed by the number of casualties, Private Dunstan unselfishly took on the additional load and carried a man to safety despite further injury. For his outstanding bravery and devotion to duty at Beaumont Hamel, Private Dunstan was awarded the Victoria Cross on 1 December 1917.  After returning to Australia in 1919, Private Dunstan resumed his apprenticeship with Hume & Co

Gnaw is a New York City noise rock band that first formed in 2007. The band has been signed to Thrill Jockey since their formation.  Gnaw is an all-female noise rock band from New York City. Formed in 2007, the self-titled debut album from Gnaw was released on Thrill Jockey in early 2009. The album was well-received and the band toured heavily in support of it, playing alongside bands like Sonic Youth, The Dwarves, and Deerhunter.  In May 2010, Gnaw released their second album, "The Collector". Recorded at producer John Congleton's (St. Vincent, The National) OK Hotel studio in Dallas, Texas, "The Collector" is a more streamlined and focused effort than the sprawling and experimental "Gnaw". The album was well-received by critics and found favor with fans of heavier music.  In November 2010, Gnaw released a split EP with Los Angeles noise rock band Fuzz. Recorded live at the Echo Lounge in Los Angeles and produced by Fuzz's guitarist/vocalist Tim Harrington, the EP is a furious and uncompromising document of two of LA's most ferocious bands trading guitar licks and sonic assaults.  In February 2013, Gnaw announced they had parted ways with Thrill Jockey Records. In March 2013, they announced they had signed to 4AD.   In September 2014, Gnaw announced they had finished recording their third album with producer John Congleton (

The May 6, 2010, flash crash, also known as the Wall Street Crash of 2010, was a sharp decline in stock prices on Wall Street on May 6, 2010. The crash was caused by a massive sell-off in stocks of large public companies in the United States during the morning hours of May 6. The stock prices of these companies had been surging upward over the previous months, partly due to strong economic indicators and partly due to expectations that President Barack Obama would be re-elected in November. However, by the end of the day, the prices of these stocks had fallen by almost twenty percent, resulting in losses for many investors.

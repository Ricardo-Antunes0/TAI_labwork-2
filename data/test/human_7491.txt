Nested wells, also referred to as nested monitoring wells, are composed of multiple tubes or pipes, typically terminating with short screened intervals (2–3 ft), installed in single boreholes. Sand packs must be installed at the screen depths and seals in the borehole are constructed between the sand packs. Nested wells are different from well clusters in that the latter consists of a cluster of wells where tubes or pipes are constructed in separate, individual boreholes that are drilled and completed at different depths. When constructing nested wells, attention must be paid to ensure the proper placement of sand in the screened intervals and bentonite between monitored intervals, by measuring the depth of the sand or bentonite frequently as the materials are being placed. However, if the seals are placed to the exact depths specified in the well design, riser casings that are touching due to de-centralization in the borehole inhibits seal placement between the risers and can allow for vertical movement of groundwater within the borehole between different monitoring zones. The likelihood of vertical leakage through the bentonite seals of a nested well increases with the number of separate casings within the borehole, or when only a small thickness of annular seal exists between the various monitored zones.

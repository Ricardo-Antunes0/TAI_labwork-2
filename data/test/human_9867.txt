Early life  Ali Abdolrezaei (Persian: علی عبدالرضایی ) was born on 10 April 1969 into a middle class farming and merchant family in the northern city of Langerud, Iran. When he was five, Abdolrezaei's newborn sister passed away unexpectedly. This overwhelming cogitation during her funeral led to a mini stroke resulting in his loss of speech. After a few months, Abdolrezaei regained speech, but it was newly characterized by a severe stammer. By age of 16 after undergoing speech therapy he fully overcame the impediment.

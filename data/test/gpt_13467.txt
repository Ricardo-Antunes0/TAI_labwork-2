Halobacterium salinarum, formerly known as Halobacterium cutirubrum, is a salt-tolerant bacterium that can be found in marine and brackish water environments. It was first isolated from the sea water of the Gulf of Aqaba in 1987. The bacterium can form biofilms which confer tolerance to salt and other environmental stresses.

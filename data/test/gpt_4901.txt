The Banana Splits are a fictional musical group that first appeared on the popular 1970s American children's television show Sesame Street. The group consisted of two Muppets, Ernie and Bert, and their human friend, Bob. The Banana Splits' musical numbers typically centered around silly jokes and slapstick humor, and were performed by the three performers in unison.  The Banana Splits' only album, released in 1971, consisted of eleven songs. After the show ended its run in 1974, the Banana Splits sporadically performed live until 1985. In 1994, they recorded a new album, but it was not commercially successful and they disbanded soon after.  The Banana Splits have since been inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame and have been recognized as one of the most important influences on modern children's entertainment.

He served as a military doctor during the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War, and in 1778 he was appointed professor of anatomy at the University of Paris. In 1782 he became a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences. Joullain is best known for his work on comparative anatomy, which made him one of the leading authorities on mammalian anatomy and physiology. He also carried out extensive studies of invertebrates, publishing a series of papers on marine animals that are still highly regarded. Joullain died in Paris on 25 January 1790.

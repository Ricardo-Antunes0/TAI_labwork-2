The Battle of Hingakākā (sometimes written Hiringakaka) was fought between two Māori armies of the North Island, near Te Awamutu and Ohaupo in the Waikato in the late 18th or early 19th centuries, and was reputedly "the largest battle ever fought on New Zealand soil". One army was from the south of the North Island and the other was from the Tainui confederation of the central North Island. Both armies included allied forces from several different hapū and iwi. Date Early New Zealand historian Percy Smith placed the battle at about 1780, basing the date purely on tribal genealogies, but evidence from Maori oral histories from warriors who fought in the battle and were still alive well after contact with Europeans suggests that 1780 is far too early. The Ngāti Whatua chief Te Murupaenga, who led his warriors into action in the battle, was judged by Samuel Marsden to be about 50 when he saw him in 1820. A date of 1780 would make him about 10 - far too young. Other Ngāti Whatua sources said that the battle occurred two years before the attack on the Boyd in 1809, making the date 1807. Oral traditions from Ngāti Maniapoto, Ngāti Te Kanawa and Ngāti Paretekawa place the battle in or around 1790-91. Sources thus differ on the date of the battle, ranging from 1790, to "about 1803" and "about 1807" - with the latter now seeming the most likely.

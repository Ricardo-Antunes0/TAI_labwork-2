Dave's Place was a national Australian weekly rock music newspaper, which was first published in Melbourne on 5 April 1977. The paper ceased publication on 15 October 2006.  Dave's Place was founded by Dave Kendall, with assistance from music journalist, broadcaster and author, Ian McFarlane. Kendall had been working as a disc jockey and journalist at ABC Radio Melbourne and saw a need for an Australian-focused rock music newspaper.  The paper quickly became popular and was distributed nationally every Thursday. It covered the latest news in the Australian rock scene, as well as interviews with artists, reviews of albums and gigs, and features on the history of Australian rock music. In addition to its print edition, Dave's Place also had a website and was available as a digital magazine.  In 2006, Kendall retired from his role as editor-in-chief of Dave's Place and handed over the reins to McFarlane. The paper stopped publishing in October 2006.

Ubiquitin-activating enzymes, also known as E1 enzymes, catalyze the first step in the ubiquitination reaction, which (among other things) can target a protein for degradation via a proteasome. This covalent bond of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins to targeted proteins is a major mechanism for regulating protein function in eukaryotic organisms. Many processes such as cell division, immune responses and embryonic development are also regulated by post-translational modification by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins. Ubiquitination (ubiquitylation) Ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) starts the ubiquitination process (Figure 1).  The E1 enzyme, along with ATP, binds to the ubiquitin protein.  The E1 enzyme then passes the ubiquitin protein to a second protein, called ubiquitin carrier or conjugation protein (E2). The E2 protein complexes with a ubiquitin protein ligase (E3).  This ubiquitin protein ligase recognizes which protein needs to be tagged and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin to that protein.  This pathway repeats itself until the target protein has a full chain of ubiquitin attached to itself.

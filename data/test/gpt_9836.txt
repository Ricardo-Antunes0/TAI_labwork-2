HMS Cornwall was an 80-gun, third rate, ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched in 1692. She was active in the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars, taking part in the Battle of Vigo Bay in 1702 and the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1797. She was wrecked off the coast of Portugal in 1809.  Cornwall was one of the first three ships of her class, and served as a model for subsequent third rates. She had a long and distinguished career, taking part in numerous battles and winning several awards. After her retirement from active service she served as a guard ship at Portsmouth Dockyard until she was sold for breaking up in 1815.

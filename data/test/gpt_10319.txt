ParticipACTION is a national non-profit organization, originally founded in 1993, that seeks to advance the participatory democracy movement in the United States. In particular, ParticipACTION seeks to increase voter turnout, promote citizen engagement in government, and support the implementation of participatory democracy principles through education and training.  ParticipACTION was founded in 1993 by a group of political activists and academics who were concerned about the decline of American democracy. They saw that the country was moving away from a system where citizens had a direct say in their government and were engaged in the political process. They wanted to reverse this trend and promote a more participatory democracy culture.  Since its founding, ParticipACTION has worked to increase voter turnout, support citizen engagement in government, and promote participatory democracy principles through education and training. In addition, it has worked to build relationships with other organizations engaged in these same goals.  Today, ParticipACTION is a national non-profit organization with chapters in all 50 states. It employs a team of professionals who work to advance participatory democracy throughout the United States.

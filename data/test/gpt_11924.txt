The Gali훾nik dialect (, Gali훾ki dijalekt) or Vidovdan dialect (, Vidovdanski dijalekt) is a dialect of the Serbo-Croatian language spoken in the Municipality of Gali훾nik, in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is one of the few surviving Serbo-Croatian dialects that have retained their original name, which is indicative of its historical importance.  The Gali훾nik dialect is distinguished by its preservation of archaic features, such as the use of the genitive case for possessive pronouns and the dative case for indirect objects. Furthermore, it has a unique system of nominal inflection, which distinguishes between two genders (masculine and feminine) and two numbers (singular and plural).

The gens Juventia, occasionally written Jubentia, was one of the most important patrician families in the Roman Republic. The first member of the gens to achieve prominence was Gaius Juventius, a plebeian who became tribune of the people in 264 BC.   The Juventii were one of the most numerous and distinguished of the patrician families, and their members held high offices in the state. Many of them attained the consulship, and a few even the dictatorship. The first member of the gens to achieve distinction was Gaius Juventius (ca. 264-203 BC), who became tribune of the people in 264 BC. He is best known for his defeat of the Marsi at Ferentium in 252 BC, an event which marked the beginning of Rome's conquest of central Italy.   After the death of Gaius Juventius, his two sons, Publius Juventius and Gaius Juventius Calvus, contended for the leadership of the patrician party. The elder son, Publius, eventually emerged victorious and became one of the most influential men in Rome. He was elected praetor in 221 BC and consul in 210 BC. He served as governor of Sicily (207-204 BC) and Sardinia (193-190 BC) and as military dictator (189-187 BC). In military affairs he was highly successful, having defeated several large armies without suffering any serious defeats himself.

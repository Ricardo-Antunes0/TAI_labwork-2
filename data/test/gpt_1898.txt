Lucy Everest Boole FRIC (5 August 1862 – 16 December 1937) was an English mathematician and philosopher.  Boole was born in Lincoln, the eldest of the five children of Edward Everest Boole and his wife Hannah Everest, née Thackray. His father was a wealthy wool merchant who became a Conservative MP for Lincoln. After attending the City of London School, Boole studied mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating with first-class honours in 1884.  Boole then undertook postgraduate studies at the University of Berlin, where he met Gottlob Frege. He returned to England and became a fellow of Trinity in 1887. In 1889 he married Evelyn Hutchinson, with whom he had two children.  Boole's early work was in pure mathematics, but he became interested in philosophy after reading Charles Sanders Peirce's Logic (1881). He began publishing on philosophical topics in 1892 and became known for his defence of logical positivism. He also wrote on mathematical logic and history of mathematics, as well as ethics and religion. He retired from Cambridge in 1933 but remained an honorary fellow there until his death.  Lucy Boole died in 1937 at the age of 78.

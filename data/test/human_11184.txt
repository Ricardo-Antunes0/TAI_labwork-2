The Peridot Mesa vent is a part of the San Carlos volcanic field located in San Carlos, Arizona, USA on the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation. The mesa is about  in diameter and is capped by a basalt flow 3 to 6 meters thick that originated from a volcanic cone located in the Southwest corner of the mesa. The flow which surrounds this vent is of special interest to igneous petrologists due to several unique qualities including the extremely high concentration of xenoliths. Formation history  The formation of Peridot Mesa is still being studied and debated today, but several theories about the initial formation have come to be widely accepted among scientists. The initial eruption was an extremely violent, high-energy pyroclastic flow. The presence of xenoliths which reach up to basketball size and beyond suggests that the magma had to have been traveling at extremely high speeds to have been able to carry such heavy pieces up with it. Current studies are being done at Arizona State University to determine a timeline history for these xenoliths based on analysis of the reaction rims around olivine crystals.

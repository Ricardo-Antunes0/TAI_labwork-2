The Jumbes of Nkhotakota were a dynasty of Swahili Arab traders based in Nkhotakota, on the western shore of Lake Malawi. They were running an East-West caravan trade,  exchanging cloths from the  Swahili coast for ivory and slaves. They introduced the Muslim faith and culture in the Nkhotakota area and were the first to grow rice and coconuts in the region. History  The founder of the dynasty, Salim bin Abdallah, arrived at Nkhotakota around 1840. He was an Arab from Zanzibar and had previously been involved in slave and ivory trade at Ujiji and Tabora in nowadays Tanzania. He asked the local Chewa chiefs for some land to establish a trading post. He was able to build his power by building dhows that enabled merchants to trade goods across the lake and because he possessed firearms with which he could protect the lake populations against the Ngoni invasions.

Macintosh Centris is a family of personal computers that were produced by Apple Computer, Inc. from 1984 to 1993. They were designed to be powerful and easy to use, with a number of innovative features, including a built-in screen saver and the ability to use the mouse as a pointing device.  The Centris family was Apple's entry into the low-cost personal computer market, and was often positioned as a lower-cost alternative to the more expensive Macintosh lines. The original Centris models were replaced by the Centris 240 in 1988, which had upgraded integrated graphics and a faster processor. The Centris 610 in 1993 was the last model in the line.

The American Quartet was a four-member vocal quartet based in New York City. The group was active from the early 1940s until its breakup in the mid-1970s.  The quartet was founded in 1943 by tenor Robert Merrill, baritone John Charles, bass-baritone Lawrence Brown, and drummer Jo Jones. The group initially performed at supper clubs and cabarets before making their first recordings in 1944. They began appearing on television in the early 1950s and became well known for their performance of classical music and popular standards.  The quartet's popularity waned in the late 1960s, but they re-formed in 1975 and continued to tour until their breakup in the mid-1970s. They have since been recognized for their contributions to American popular music and have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and the American Songbook Hall of Fame.

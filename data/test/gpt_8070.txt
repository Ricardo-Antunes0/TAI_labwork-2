The Russian bounty program is an alleged government-sponsored program to reward individuals who provide information that leads to the arrest or conviction of criminal suspects or terrorists. The program reportedly began in 2012, and has been reported to offer a cash reward of up to $50,000 for information that leads to the arrest or conviction of a terrorist suspect.  The Russian bounty program has been criticized for its lack of transparency and oversight, and for its potential to reward individuals for information that is false or politically motivated. Additionally, the program has been accused of benefiting corrupt government officials more than innocent citizens who provide information that leads to the arrest or conviction of criminals.

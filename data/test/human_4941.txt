Shalom was a Czech synth-pop band active between the years 1992–1994. The core of the project consisted of Petr Muk and Petr Kučera, with consistent support from Petr Hons, three musicians who were until 1993 also active in the popular Erasure-influenced band Oceán from České Budějovice. The trio was complemented by a number of rotating female vocalists including Jana Benetová, Jana Feriová, Jana Badurová, and later Jana Petrová, Linda Finková, Michaela Klímková, and Olina Mašková. Shalom released two studio albums and a number of hit singles before breaking up in 1994. History During the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia, the band Oceán, thanks to their manager Jiří Vatka, had the opportunity to open for the English duo Erasure in Prague. Following this, the trio of Kučera, Muk, and Hons came up with a number of song ideas which didn't appeal to the rest of the band, so they decided to create a side project, which they called Shalom. The project dabbled strongly in Jewish themes and symbolism, something Muk had been toying with for a while. In 1992, the self-titled debut album was released. Singers Jana Benetová, Jana Feriová, and Jana Badurová were invited to join the project. The first music videos were recorded in Slovakia, and later in Israel.

Kettering High School was a four-year high school within the Detroit Public Schools system. The school, located in the low-income Gratiot Town/Kettering neighborhood, was around 1,200 students under capacity at its closure in 2012. History Kettering opened in 1965 in response to the growing Detroit Public School system (DPS) and to serve the needs of factory workers and their families in east Detroit. The school is named after Charles F. Kettering, co-founder of DELCO and head of research at General Motors for 27 years. Construction began in 1961 with removal of housing on the land where Kettering would stand, but due to financial difficulties and worker strikes, the school did not open until fall 1965. The school was compliant with desegregation efforts from the start. Additional classrooms and the gym were built between 1967 and 1969; a pool was planned but was delayed until 1975 by Milliken v. Bradley, a major move towards desegregation in DPS. The city itself was dramatically segregated and enrollment records show 89% of Kettering was Black while Denby High School, just 5 miles away, was 93% white.

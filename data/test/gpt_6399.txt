Patronage is the support, encouragement, privilege, or financial assistance a person provides to a cause, organization, or individual.  Patronage has been around for centuries and continues to be an important part of society. There are many different types of patronage, including private, public, corporate, and individual. Public patronage is the main form of support for the arts and other cultural institutions. Corporate patronage is often used to reward employees for their hard work and dedication. Individual patronage is usually given to individuals who have done something special or who are seen as having a valuable contribution to make to a particular cause or organization.

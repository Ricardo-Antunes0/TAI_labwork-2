Life history theory is an analytical framework used to study variation in life histories among populations of organisms. It has been used to explain the distribution and abundance of species, the evolution of life histories, and the variation in fitness among individuals within populations.  Life history theory is based on the premise that variation in life history traits (e.g., reproductive effort, longevity, migration) is caused by the trade-off between fitness and resource allocation. In other words, different life history strategies are likely to be advantageous under different environmental conditions. This theory has been used to explain a wide range of patterns in population biology, including the distribution and abundance of species, the evolution of life histories, and the variation in fitness among individuals within populations.

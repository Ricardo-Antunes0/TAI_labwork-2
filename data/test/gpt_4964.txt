Acne fulminans (also known as "acute febrile acne", "acute urticaria", "acute generalized eosinophilia" or simply "acne") is a rare, life-threatening skin condition characterized by fever, redness, swelling and pain. It occurs most often in young adults, but can also occur in children or older adults.  Acne fulminans is caused by a type of bacteria called "Staphylococcus aureus". The bacteria enter the skin through a break in the skin's protective barrier and cause the inflammation and scarring that is characteristic of acne. Acne fulminans can be fatal if not treated promptly with antibiotics.

An Cumann Gaelach (English: "Irish Language Society") is a voluntary organisation devoted to the preservation and promotion of the Irish language, both within Ireland and abroad. It was founded in 1913 and has since become one of the most influential organisations in Irish language preservation. The Cumann Gaelach publishes a quarterly journal, An tOireann, and organises lectures, conferences and other events throughout Ireland and abroad.

Petrus (or Peter) van Mastricht (or Maastricht) (1581â€“1647) was a Dutch physician, anatomist and natural philosopher, who made important contributions to the understanding of the nervous system. His 1636 book De Nervus (The Nerve) is considered one of the seminal works in neurology.  Born in Maastricht, Netherlands, van Mastricht studied medicine at the University of Leuven. In 1611 he became a doctor at the University of Utrecht, where he remained until his death. He is best known for his book De Nervus (1636), in which he proposed a theory of the nervous system based on his observations of animal and human anatomy. Van Mastricht's theory remains influential to this day.  Van Mastricht also made significant contributions to anatomy and physiology, publishing works on topics such as respiration, digestion and the circulatory system. He is also credited with being the first person to describe aneurysms and arteriosclerosis.  Van Mastricht was a highly respected member of the scientific community, and was twice elected president of the Accademia Reale dei Lincei. He was also a member of the Royal Society of London and the Leopoldine Society. He died in Utrecht at the age of 70.

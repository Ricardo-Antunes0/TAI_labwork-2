The Great Lakes freighter SS Henry Steinbrenner was launched on October 10, 1942, by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation in Quincy, Massachusetts. Her maiden voyage took her from her homeport of Detroit, Michigan, to the port of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Steinbrenner was the largest freighter in the North Atlantic at the time of her construction.  The Steinbrenner served in the Merchant Marine throughout World War II, transporting goods and passengers across the North Atlantic Ocean. She was involved in several notable wartime incidents, including a rescue mission to save survivors of the SS Athenia after she sank off the coast of Scotland in 1943.  After the war, the Steinbrenner continued to operate as a merchant ship. In 1956, she was sold to a Yugoslavian company and renamed Jadran. She later became a cruise ship and was retired in 1998. The Steinbrenner is currently preserved as a museum ship at the Detroit Maritime Museum.

Aquaforte is a town on the south coast of Sicily, Italy. It is a popular tourist destination, and has a long history dating back to the Punic Wars.  Aquaforte is located on the Tyrrhenian Sea, about south-east of Palermo and about south-west of Catania. The town has a population of about 10,000. The town is connected to the mainland by a bridge.  The town's origins date back to the Punic Wars, when it was a strategic location between Greece and Carthage. Aquaforte became a town in the Middle Ages, and its inhabitants were refugees from the earthquakes that plagued Sicily in the 16th century. Aquaforte was heavily damaged by an earthquake in 1883, but was rebuilt with assistance from King Umberto I of Italy.  Aquaforte is famous for its production of aquaforte (a type of liqueur), its beaches and its seafood. There are also several churches and palazzi in the town, including the Church of Santa Maria della Pace and the Palazzo Carafa.

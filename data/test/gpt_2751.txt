In English law, oyer and terminer (; from Middle French, "to hear and to terminate") is a term meaning that someone has been given authority to hear and determine an issue or case. The term is most notably used in the context of criminal law, where it refers to the jurisdiction of a court to try a defendant.  The term is also used in other legal systems, such as Canadian civil law and French procedural law, where it refers to the jurisdiction of a court to hear and rule on any legal matter.

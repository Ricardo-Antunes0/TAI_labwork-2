Kunzea amathicola, also known by the Maori name Raukawa, is a flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae and is endemic to New Zealand. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching up to 2.5 m tall, with a trunk up to 30 cm diameter, and prominent reddish-brown bark. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, are elliptic to lance-shaped, and measure up to 10 cm long and 5 cm wide. The flowers are arranged in panicles along the branches and are white or pale pink, sometimes with reddish blotches. The fruit is a capsule which contains two seeds.   Kunzea amathicola is found only in the North Island of New Zealand, where it grows in coastal areas on the lower reaches of the Waikato River and adjacent wetland areas. It is threatened by habitat loss due to development, and there are believed to be only around 100 surviving plants.

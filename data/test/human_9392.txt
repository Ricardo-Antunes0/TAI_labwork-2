Steven Ross Smith (born June 25, 1945) is a Canadian poet, sound poet, fiction writer, arts journalist and arts activist. He is best known for his fluttertongue poems, which have been published in six volumes. One of them, fluttertongue 3: disarray, won the 2005 Book of the Year Award at the Saskatchewan Book Awards. The fluttertongue poems have been described as a dance with words that pushes the boundaries of both language and poetry. Smith is also known for his vigorous live performances of sound poetry. He has contributed to more than a dozen recordings including Homo Sonorous: An International Anthology of Sound Poetry released by the National Centre for Contemporary Arts, Kaliningrad, Russia, (2001), Revolutions, A Compilation of Saskatchewan Sound Works, (2000) and Carnivocal: A Celebration of Sound Poetry (1999). From 1992 to 2000, Smith performed with DUCT, the improvisatory sound and music ensemble he founded. He was also a member of the sound/performance ensemble Owen Sound from 1975 to 1985.

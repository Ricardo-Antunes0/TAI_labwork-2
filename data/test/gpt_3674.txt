Icehouse pieces, or Icehouse Pyramids, Treehouse pieces, and other similar shapes are a popular architectural form in the United States and Canada. They are made of large sheets of sheet vinyl or other sheet material that are cut into a desired shape, then covered with a thin layer of ice and reinforced with wooden frames. The ice melts and the resulting curves and shapes form an interesting architectural feature.  The first known use of this architectural form is thought to be in 1967 in the town of Icehouse, Alberta, Canada. The name "Icehouse pieces" was coined by the local builder who used them to build his home.   The popularity of these pieces has led to their use in many different areas, including churches, commercial buildings, and homes. They are often used as exterior ornamentation or as part of a garden feature.

Duludao class dispatch boat is a class of naval boat in service with the People's Liberation Army Navy.  The Duludao class is an updated version of the former Type 071 patrol boat, which entered service with the PLA Navy in the early 1990s. The new boats are larger and have improved capabilities, including anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and anti-ship warfare (ASW). The PLA Navy plans to replace all of its older Type 071 boats with the Duludao class by 2020.  The Duludao class is based on the Ukrainian Zaporozhian Sich-class patrol boat design, which was license-made in China by Jiangnan Shipyard. In common with other Chinese naval patrol boats, the Duludao class features a bow-mounted sonar and a single torpedo tube. However, unlike most Chinese naval patrol boats, which are designed for coastal patrols and local counter-piracy operations, the Duludao class is designed for long-range ASW and ASW escort missions.

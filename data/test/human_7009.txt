The Navistar VT engine family is a line of diesel engines that was produced by International Truck and Engine (Navistar International) from 2003 to 2016.  Developed as the replacement for the T444E V8, the VT V6 and V8 diesels were the smallest diesel engines used in Navistar vehicles, slotted below the DT inline-6 engine family.  Sharing many applications with the DT466 inline-6, the VT engines were used in medium-duty trucks and school bus chassis, competing against the Cummins B-series and the Mercedes-Benz MBE900 diesel engines.  In 2007, both the VT and DT engines were rebranded under the MaxxForce brand name, with model designations related to their displacement.    From 2003 to 2010, VT engines were used by Ford Motor Company in several vehicles, sold as the second and third generations of the Ford Power Stroke diesel engine family. Fords E series continued to use the VT365 until the end of 2012.  For 2011 production, the Power Stroke diesel shifted to a Ford-produced design.

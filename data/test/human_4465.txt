OneHope is an international ministry based in Pompano Beach, Florida. OneHope is working in over 100 countries to present a biblical message of hope to children and youth through age- and culturally-specific programs including: children's magazines, storytelling, animated movies, interactive games,  sports programs, smartphone apps  and more. Working with churches, partner ministries, local governments, schools and non-governmental organizations, OneHope has reached more than one billion children with a relevant presentation of God's Word. The organization also conducts research in 44 countries around the world to gain insight into children's daily lives, faith, cultural influences and values. History OneHope (formerly Book of Hope International) was founded in 1987 by former missionary and Life Publishers  President Bob Hoskins. That year, Hoskins was asked by the Minister of Education in El Salvador to provide Bibles to the country's 968,000 school children.  Instead of Bibles, he delivered the Book of Hopeâ€”an interactive, Bible-based publication customized for the special challenges and interests of the country's children and youth. By 2000, the Book of Hope had been shared not only with children in El Salvador but also with children in Haiti, Africa and Eastern Europe.

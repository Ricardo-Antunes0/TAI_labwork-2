Alfred Moore (May 21, 1755 – October 15, 1836) was an American jurist and statesman who served as the ninth Chief Justice of the United States from 1829 to 1835. Moore was a leader of the Democratic-Republican Party and played a pivotal role in the development of the U.S. Constitution.  Moore was born in Frederick County, Maryland, to Richard Moore and Sarah Moore (née Moseley). He studied law under Judge John Hanson and was admitted to the bar in 1777. He commenced practice in Baltimore, Maryland, and soon became one of the leading lawyers in the state. In 1784, Moore was elected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Moore served as Maryland's Attorney General from 1796 to 1800, and then as its Governor from 1801 to 1802. He served as a U.S. Representative from Maryland from 1813 to 1815, when he resigned to become Chief Justice of the United States. He served in that position until his resignation in March 1835, following an unsuccessful reelection campaign. He died in Washington, D.C., on October 15, 1836.  Moore is highly regarded for his work on the U.S. Constitution and for his judicial decisions on constitutional law. He is also widely recognized for his "Founders' Doctrine", which holds that U.S. Constitutional law is based on the principles set out by the Founding Fathers

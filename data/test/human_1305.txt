Ministry of Testing, also referred to as the MoT, is a global software testing community that was founded by Rosie Sherry, who was longlisted for most influential woman in UK tech by Computer Weekly in 2017 and 2018, as well as listed in the Female Founders 101 list by BusinessCloud. MoT started out as a UK-based internet forum for software testers and quickly grew into an independent business that provides software testing conferences and Meetups around the world, and an online learning platform dedicated to the craft of software testing. Members of the Ministry of Testing community consist of software testers and those working in software quality. The community created by Ministry of Testing aims to get its participants sharing innovative practises and ideas around software testing. Computer Scientists at the University of Maryland used Ministry of Testing (along with organisations) to recruit software testers for a study into identifying vulnerabilities in software.

In telecommunication, a master station is a telecommunications relay or switch, which is responsible for the high-priority transmission of a radio communication over a network. In a master station, the transmitter is usually located at the highest point on the network and the receiver is usually located at the lowest point on the network. The master station coordinates the transmissions of other stations on the network.

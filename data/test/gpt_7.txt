The Formidable-class multi-role stealth frigates are the latest class of Royal Navy warships. They are designed to operate in a wide range of scenarios, including anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and support for amphibious operations.  The Formidable-class frigates are the successor to the Type 23 frigate. They were initially planned as a new class of four ships, but the programme was later expanded to eight ships. The first ship was commissioned in 2017, and the final ship is scheduled for commission in 2024.

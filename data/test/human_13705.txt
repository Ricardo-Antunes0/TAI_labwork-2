Sonia Bunting, OLS (9 December 1922 â€“ 24 March 2001) was a South African journalist, and a political and anti-apartheid activist. After being charged with treason and imprisoned, being detained a second time, and barred from publishing, she and her husband went into exile in London, where she joined the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) and organised the World Campaign for the Release of South African Political Prisoners. When the African National Congress (ANC) ban was lifted in 1991, she returned to South Africa where she was involved in political activism until her death in 2001. She was posthumously honored by the government of South Africa with the Order of Luthuli in Silver in 2010. Early life Sonia Beryl Isaacman was born on 9 December 1922 in Johannesburg, South Africa to Dora and David Isaacman. Her parents were Jewish exiles, who had fled from Eastern Europe to escape anti-Semitic pogroms. After her matriculation from her secondary education, Isaacman enrolled at the University of the Witwatersrand to pursue medical studies. In 1942, while studying at university, she joined the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA), the only multiracial political party in the country at that time. She began campaigning for universal suffrage and subsequently terminated her medical studies after completing one year of schooling.

Periyachi (Tamil: பெரியாச்சி, ) is a ferocious aspect of the Goddess in Hinduism. She is also known as Periyachi Amman (amman meaning "Mother") and sometimes called as Periyachi Kali amman and she is associated with another powerful goddess Kali. Periyachi is said to be the protector of children and is associated with childbirth and pregnancy, and is also associated with Hinduism in Singapore and Malaysia. Legend There was once a Pandya king named Vallalarajan Rajah who evilly tormented his subjects. It was said that if his child touched the earth then this act would bring an end to the king. When the queen went into labour, the king could not find a mid-wife. He had to choose a woman named Periyachi. This stern woman successfully completed the delivery of the child and held it up so that it did not touch the earth. The king wanted to kill the newborn, in the intent to preserve his own life. The king did not know that Periyachi was the goddess Parvati, so he was surprised when she took on her true form. Using her multiple arms she trampled the king under her foot. Then, she killed the king using her weapons. At the same time, the queen also wanted to kill the baby as she considered the innocent baby evil but Periyachi killed the queen, ripped out her stomach and ate her intestines, and saved the baby. Therefore Periyachi was known as the protector of babies and expectant mothers.

Pavel Anděl (born 1966, Cheb, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic)) is a Czech artist who lives and works in Prague.  Anděl's work frequently deals with the connection between humans and nature, often using natural materials such as wood, stone and earth. His paintings are known for their use of light and shadow, and for their often enigmatic or dream-like depictions of landscapes, people and animals. Anděl has exhibited his work internationally, including at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh. He has also been awarded numerous prizes, including the Grand Prize at the 2002 Venice Biennale and the 2003 Viennese Art Prize.

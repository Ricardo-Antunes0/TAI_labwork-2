PRIVATE was a pop music group formed in 2006 by Danish producer/singer Thomas Troelsen, along with guitarist Asger Tarpgaard and vocalist Tanja Simonsen, and was later a solo project by Troelsen. PRIVATE's debut album “My Secret Lover” was produced and recorded by Troelsen and mixed by Jason Boshoff (Basement Jaxx). The first single, of the same title, achieved Gold sales in Denmark and reached #1 on the Danish singles, radio, and download charts. "My Secret Lover" was released in the UK on 17 January 2010 on Virgin Records with remixes by Diplo, Egyptian Lover, Spencer & Hill, and Rune RK. PRIVATE's debut received attention from a number of influential blogs including Perezhilton.com, Arjanwrites.com and the UK's Popjustice, who called the single "completely hypnotic and brilliant." The band has also been featured in Dazed & Confused, NME, Attitude, The Guardian, and Monocle. On his blog, Diplo—who remixed "My Secret Lover"—called PRIVATE "the best current pop music group in the world."

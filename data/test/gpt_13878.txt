Kroncong (pronounced "kronchong"; , ) is the Malaysian national music genre. It is a mix of Indonesian and Malaysian folk music, with influences from Chinese opera and film music. The word kroncong is derived from the Malay word "kroncong" meaning "a stringed instrument with a wooden body and a neck made of bamboo or wood".  The kroncong was first played in the Straits Settlements in the early twentieth century. In the 1940s, musicians in Kuala Lumpur began to experiment with the kroncong style, and by the 1950s, it had become popular throughout Malaysia. The kroncong is often compared to the jazz music of the United States, because both genres are based on improvisation and incorporate elements of classical and popular music.  Today, kroncong is largely considered a Malaysian national music genre, and is played throughout the country. There are few kroncong bands outside of Malaysia, and those that do play worldwide tours. The Malaysian government has promoted kroncong as an important part of Malaysian culture, and has helped to support the genre by funding concerts and festivals.

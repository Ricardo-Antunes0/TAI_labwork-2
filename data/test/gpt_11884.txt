The Oblation Run (sometimes referred to as the Holy Run or the Sacred Run) is an annual 5K race held in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The race is organized by the Catholic Church and is intended to promote health and fitness, as well as to raise money for charity.  The Oblation Run was first conceived in 1992 as a way to promote community spirit and raise money for charity. The race began as a 1.5 mile race, but has since grown to a 5K event. The event features a variety of races for runners of all abilities, including a children's race, a wheelchair race, and a relay race. The race takes place on the first Sunday of May each year.  The Oblation Run is one of the largest Catholic charitable events in the United States, and has raised over $15 million for charity since its inception. The event has been praised by both media outlets and church officials for its positive impact on the community, its promotion of health and fitness, and its ability to raise money for worthwhile causes.

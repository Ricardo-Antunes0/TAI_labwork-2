George Dorris (born August 3, 1930) is an American poet and essayist. Dorris is known primarily for his lyrical and accessible writing, as well as his mastery of the short story form.  Dorris was born in San Francisco, California in 1930, the son of a lawyer. He attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, where he majored in English and minored in philosophy. After graduation, he served in the United States Army during the Korean War. He then returned to Antioch, where he taught writing for several years.  Dorris's first collection of poetry, The Glass Palace (1965), was well-received and led to invitations to give readings and lectures around the country. He has since published more than a dozen collections of poetry, including The Collected Poems (1995), The Map and the Territory (1998), and This Is How You Lose Her (2007). His work has been translated into more than twenty languages.  Dorris's essays have appeared in such publications as Harper's, The New York Times Book Review, The Atlantic Monthly, Esquire, and The New Yorker. His most recent book is A Home at the End of the World: A Memoir (2013). Dorris lives in Amherst, Massachusetts.

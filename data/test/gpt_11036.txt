Bipolar electrochemistry is a phenomenon in electrochemistry in which an electric potential on one side of a double-layer capacitor causes different electrochemical reactions on the two sides of the capacitor.  Bipolar electrochemistry is a phenomenon in electrochemistry in which an electric potential on one side of a double-layer capacitor causes different electrochemical reactions on the two sides of the capacitor. It is used in diverse fields such as energy storage, catalysis, and sensors.

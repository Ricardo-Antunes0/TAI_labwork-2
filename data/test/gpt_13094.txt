Jānis Poruks (13 October 1871 – 25 May 1948) was a Latvian painter, graphic artist and sculptor. He is considered one of the most important representatives of the Baltic Secessionist movement in the early 20th century.  Poruks was born in Rīga to a family of craftsmen and grew up in a highly intellectual environment. After completing his secondary education in Rīga, he enrolled at the Riga School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, where he studied with Jānis Plakans. In 1895 he completed his studies and moved to Saint Petersburg, Russia, where he began to exhibit his works.  In 1903 Poruks returned to Riga and founded the "Latvian Art Society". He also became a member of the Latvian Academy of Sciences and Arts. In 1911 he was elected an honorary member of the Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg.  During World War I, Poruks served in the Latvian military and participated in several battles on the Eastern Front. After the war he resumed his artistic career, but by this time his work had come to be seen as radical and separatist. He died in 1948 in Riga.

The 2018 Argentine monetary crisis was a severe devaluation of the Argentine peso, caused by high inflation and steep fall in the perceived value of the currency at the local level as it continually lost purchasing power, along with other domestic and international factors. As a result of it, the presidency of Mauricio Macri requested a loan from the International Monetary Fund. Background The presidency of Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner ended in 2015, and the new president Mauricio Macri sought to change many of the abnormal aspects of the economy of Argentina left behind by Kirchner. The Central Bank of Argentina's reserves were depleted; the annual inflation was over 30 percent, the country had the highest tax rates in history but the government budget balance had an eight-percent deficit, and government faced international legal battles over its  sovereign default after the Kirchner administration refused to continue payments of the  country's gigantic foreign debt. Tight currency controls had been in place since 2011 creating a parallel shadow market for foreign exchange currency and a global drop in commodity prices sharply reduced expected trade revenue furthering straining the country's already weak economy.   One of Macri's first economic policies was the removal of currency controls, allowing Argentinians to freely buy and sell foreign currencies on the market. Another early policy was the removal of export quotas and tariffs on corn and wheat. Tariffs on soybeans, Argentina's most lucrative export, were reduced from 35 to 30 percent. And he also ended the national default. Though these measures where applauded by the experts and foreign trade organisations, it failed to produce the economic boom that president Marci had promised during his campaign. Inflation remained high and the overall economic growth was weak. However, the modest economic recovery was enough to allow a victory at the 2017 midterm elections, surpassing Kirchner in the Buenos Aires province by a wide margin.

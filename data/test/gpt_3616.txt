Russell E. Blunt (April 24, 1908, in Columbus, Ohio – November 17, 1997) was an American politician who served as a U.S. Representative from Ohio from 1951 to 1973 and as a U.S. Senator from 1973 to 1981. He was the Republican nominee for Vice President of the United States in the 1972 presidential election, and lost to incumbent Richard M. Nixon.  Russell Blunt was born in Columbus, Ohio on April 24, 1908, the son of Lucy Louise (née Owen) and Russell E. Blunt. He attended public schools in Columbus before attending Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he earned a B.A. in 1930 and an M.B.A. in 1933. He worked as an accountant for several years before becoming a businessman in 1937.  Blunt was elected as a Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio's 8th district in 1950, defeating incumbent Democrat Carl Stokes by just over 1,000 votes. He served there until he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1973, defeating incumbent Democrat George V. Voinovich by more than 350,000 votes (a margin of only 0.5%). He served in the Senate until his retirement in 1981, making him one of the most influential members of that body during its conservative era (the 1970s).  In 1974 and 1976, Blunt unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for President of the United States against incumbent Richard M. Nixon; he finished third both times behind

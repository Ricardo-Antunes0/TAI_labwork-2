Nvidia's High-Definition Digital Processing (HDVP) is a HDTV accelerator on the Geforce 2 GTS.  It has a downscalar that supports 1080i and 720p to sdtv resolution.  In combination with a tuner chip it creates an accelerated hdtv viewing system that supports time-shifted recording.  The Geforce 2 GTS also includes second generation motion compensation, improved from the motion compensation on the Geforce 256.  It does not seem to include IDCT acceleration.  The HDVP also includes de-interlace acceleration including bob, weave, temporal filter, and advanced de-interlacing.  Finally, HDVP supports subpicture compositing, and color enhancements including brightness, hue, contrast, and saturation.  nVidia's HDVP would endure through the GeForce 4 Series in the Geforce 4 Ti NV25.

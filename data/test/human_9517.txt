Stanley Woods (1903 – 28 July 1993) was an Irish motorcycle racer famous for 29 motorcycle Grand Prix wins in the 1920s and 1930s, winning the Isle of Man TT races ten times in his career, plus wins at Assen and elsewhere. He was also a skilled trials rider, competing in the 1940s. Life Woods was born in Dublin and educated at The High School, Dublin. He started racing in 1921 on a Harley-Davidson and made his début on the new Isle of Man Snaefell Mountain Course in 1922 as a promising seventeen-year-old, finishing fifth in the Junior TT on a Cotton, even though his machine had a fire at a pit stop, after which he completed the race without brakes. He won it the following year. His association with Norton spanned the years from 1926 until 1934 during which he won four of the 1927 Grands Prix, two more in 1928 and several more in the following years. He became disillusioned with the Norton and rode for Moto Guzzi in 1935 giving them their first victory at the TT Races, only the second time a non-English motorcycle had won (the first being an Indian, ridden by Oliver Godfrey in 1911).

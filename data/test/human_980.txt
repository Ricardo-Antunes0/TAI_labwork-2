Lý Tự Trọng (20 October 1914 in Thailand – 21 November 1931 in Saigon) was a Vietnamese revolutionary, executed by the French when he was only 17 years old. He is considered to be a revolutionary martyr. In 2010, his remains were identified in District 10, Ho Chi Minh City, and he was reburied in his parents' home town, the Việt Xuyên commune in the district of Thạch Hà. On February 9, 1931, during a rally in Le Grand Park in Saigon, celebrating the anniversary of the Yen Bai uprising, Trong used a firearm to shoot at anti-Communist French secret police. He did that to protect Phan Bội Châu, who was speaking at the rally. There was a fear Phan Boi would be assassinated, due to the inflammatory and Marxist-oriented content of his speech. He fled south as a fugitive. Trong was arrested 10 days later in the town of Khám lớn Cần Thơ, about  south-west of Saigon. He was brought back to Saigon, hastily tried by French officials, sentenced to death on November 20, 1931, and executed the next day, aged 17. The cruel punishment suffered by Trong sparked strong feelings of anger amongst Communists all over Vietnam toward the French leadership. Trong was viewed as a martyr and his fate was seen as symbolic of French brutality.

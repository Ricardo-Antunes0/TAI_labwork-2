The Loki-Schmidt-Garten, also known as Botanischer Garten Hamburg, or, more formally, as Botanischer Garten der Universit√§t Hamburg or Biozentrum Klein Flottbek und Botanischer Garten, is a botanical garden maintained by the University of Hamburg. It has a size of around 25 hectares and is located at Ohnhorststrasse 18, Hamburg, Germany, beside the Klein Flottbek station in the Osdorf quarter, and open daily without charge. It was renamed in 2012 after Loki Schmidt, the wife of the former German chancellor Helmut Schmidt. Though it was renamed, the old name coexists with the new one. Nearby Klein Flottbek station still has the second name "Botanischer Garten". History Although the garden's institutional history dates to its first establishment in 1821 and transfer in 1919 to the University of Hamburg, today's Loki-Schmidt-Garten, then Botanischer Garten Hamburg, opened in 1979. Its earlier site still remains as the Alter Botanischer Garten Hamburg, which contains the garden's greenhouses. Therefore, Loki-Schmidt-Garten is sometimes called Neuer Botanischer Garten (New Botanical Garden).

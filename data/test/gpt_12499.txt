Elizabeth Laurie Rees (1885â€“1971), known as "Bessie", was an English artist who was a pioneer of the abstract art movement.  Elizabeth Laurie Rees was born in 1885 in Stoke Newington, London, England. She was the daughter of artist and teacher Elizabeth Laurie and her husband, the sculptor Alfred Rees. She studied at the Royal Academy of Arts from 1905 to 1908, where she became acquainted with the work of artists such as William Blake and J.M.W. Turner.  Rees began her career as a painter in the 1910s, exhibiting her work at the Royal Academy and winning several awards. She became known for her abstract art, which focused on the use of color and texture to create images that were largely devoid of traditional figural elements. Her work was influential in the development of abstract art in Britain and abroad, and she was awarded the prestigious British Order of Merit in 1948. Rees died in 1971 at the age of 90.

Suraj Prakash (lit. "The Light of the Sun"), also called Gur Partap Suraj Granth, is a popular and monumental hagiographic text about Sikh Gurus written by Kavi Santokh Singh (1787–1843) and published in 1843 CE. It consists of life legends performed by Sikh Gurus and historic Sikhs such as Baba Banda Bahadur in 51,820 verses. According to Pashaura Singh – a scholar of Sikhism, the text freely borrows from prior mythical stories in Janamsakshis and older Sikh literature such as Bansavalinama, Sikhan di Bhagat Mala, and Mahima Prakash, then embellishes it further.  The Suraj Prakash is written in Braj Bhasha language in Gurmukhi script, with significant use of Sanskrit words. It is organized into "seasons" and "rays". It includes Vedantic doctrines of Udasi Sikhs and Nirmala Sikhs. The text also incorporates some ideas of the Hindalis considered heretical by Khalsa Sikhs. This, states Pashaura Singh, may have been the result of the traditional Sikh schools in Amritsar of 18th– and 19th–century which included Vedanta as a standard part of the Sikh learning.

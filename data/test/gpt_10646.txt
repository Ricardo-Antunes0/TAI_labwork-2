Domenico Cavagnari (20 July 1876, Genoa â€“ 10 February 1953, Genoa) was an Italian composer best known for his operas.  Cavagnari was born in Genoa to a musical family. His father, Giovanni Battista Cavagnari, was a violinist and composer who taught his son the basics of composition and music theory. Cavagnari began composing at an early age, and in 1898 he wrote his first opera, Amleto. He began to receive critical acclaim in the early 1900s for his works, but it was not until after World War I that he became well-known. He remained a popular composer throughout his life, and many of his works remain popular today.

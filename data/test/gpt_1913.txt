The Protestant Union , also known as the Protestant Union of Germany or the Protestant Union of the Rhineland, was a political alliance of Protestant churches in the German Empire and the German Confederation.  The alliance was established on 29 October 1815 in the Congress of Vienna as part of the compromise settlement that ended the Napoleonic Wars. The Protestant Union aimed to counter the Catholic Centre Party and its influence in German politics. The Protestant Union failed to win a majority in any election, but it played a major role in German politics from 1815 until its dissolution in 1866.

The Mitchell Principles were six ground rules proposed by United States Senator Everett Dirksen in 1971 which aimed to improve the functioning of the United States Senate. The principles were popularized by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell in 1982.  The six principles are:  The first principle is that the Senate should be an equal and indivisible chamber. The second principle is that the majority party should not be able to use its numerical advantage to obstruct or delay legislation. The third principle is that senators should be free to debate and amend bills without fear of retribution from their party leaders. The fourth principle is that senators should be given a reasonable amount of time to study and debate bills before voting on them. The fifth principle is that senators should be given a fair opportunity to make their case to the people of their state or district before running for re-election. The sixth and final principle is that senators should be willing to give up their seats if they are found guilty of wrongdoing.

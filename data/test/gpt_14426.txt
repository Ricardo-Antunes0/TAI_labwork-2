St Jovite (11 March 1989 â€“ 9 December 2013) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse.  St Jovite was a dark bay or brown horse with a white sock on his left hind leg bred in Kentucky by the Claiborne Farm. He was sired by the successful racemare Northern Dancer, out of the mare Jet Pilot. His dam was the outstanding broodmare Champion's Choice, who also produced the stakes winners Alydar and Quality Road.  St Jovite raced in Europe and won three Group One races in Britain as well as being placed in the Irish 2000 Guineas, Epsom Derby and Sussex Stakes. He then made his only appearance in North America, finishing third in the Breeders' Cup Classic.  After his retirement from racing, St Jovite became a breeding stallion at Claiborne Farm and had some successful offspring, including the Classic winner Gilded Time and two-time Group One winner Oasis Dream. He died in 2013 at the age of twenty-seven.

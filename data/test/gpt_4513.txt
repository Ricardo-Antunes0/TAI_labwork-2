In the behavioral sciences, ecological validity is the degree to which a study's results are relevant to the real-world situation in which it was conducted. It is a measure of how well the study's design and methods reflect the natural setting in which the behavior occurs.  Ecological validity is important because it allows scientists to make valid comparisons between different studies and to draw general conclusions about how different behaviors are related. For example, if scientists study how people respond to incentives in different settings, they want their findings to be applicable to the real world. If their study does not have ecological validity, it may be impossible to generalize the results to other settings.  There are several factors that affect ecological validity. The setting in which the behavior occurs is one factor. The type of behavior studied is another. For example, one study might measure how people respond to incentives in a laboratory setting, while another might measure how people respond on a farm. The context in which the behavior occurs is also important. For example, if scientists study aggression between animals in a zoo, their findings may not be generalizable to humans living in communities.  Design and methodological quality are also important factors. Poor design can create bias in the data, while poor methods can lead to inaccurate results. Researchers must take all of these factors into account when designing studies and conducting research."

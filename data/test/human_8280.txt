San Pedro Boatworks also called the San Pedro Boat and Yacht Company was a boatyard in San Pedro, California the entrance to the West Channel of Los Angeles Harbor, at berth 44 and next to fire station 110. The boatyard opened in 1923 and closed in 2002, the site has been abandoned since then. The address is 210 Whalers Walk, San Pedro, with the office at 2945 Miner Street. L.A Harbor Marine operated the site from 1965 to 1969.  Pacific American also operated the boatyard for many years, owned by San Pedro Boatworks. In 1974 the operation was taken over by Marin Vincent. Later Billfish Inc. took over operations. In 1993, BCI Coca-Cola took over operations. Over the years the yard continued to build and repair boats including military boats, purse seiners, yachts, fireboats, and lifeboats. Port of Los Angeles is looking to reopen the site as the L.A. Shipyard to serve the local boats. The project is part of the Berth 44 Boatyard Development project. The new yard would work on boats from 40 to 150 feet and maybe larger. The proposed site would be 3 acres of land and one acre of water, located between Berth 46 and the Cabrillo Way Marina. Currently Al Larson Boat Shop is the only operating boatyard in LA.

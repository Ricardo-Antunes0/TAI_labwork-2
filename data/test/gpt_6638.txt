Hopetoun House is a country house near the village of Hopetoun, in the Scottish Borders. The house is now a tourist attraction and is open to the public.  The house was built in the early 17th century for the Graham family, who were Lairds of Hopetoun. The Grahams were a powerful family and used Hopetoun House as their principal residence. The house was later acquired by the Duke of Buccleuch and then passed through a number of other owners before being bought by the Scottish National Trust in 1948. It is now open to the public and is one of Scotland's most popular tourist attractions.  The house is built in the Scots Baronial style and is made from sandstone ashlar. It has a three-storeyed main block with a single-storey wing to the north. The roof is slate and there are several gables on the roof. The windows are mainly casements, with some double-hung sashes. The entrance front is decorated with quoins and a pedimented gable. There is also a double garage on the north side of the house.

Fence is an American comic book series written by C. S. Pacat and drawn by Johanna the Mad; both of them are co-creators. The comic book focuses on Nicholas Cox, the illegitimate son of U.S. fencing Olympic champion Robert Coste, who aspires to become a fencing champion like his father. Despite being talented, he's roughly trained due to the hard conditions he grew up in. While at a competition, he's quickly beaten by the fencing prodigy Seiji Katayama and Nicholas vows to beat him. Managing to get into the elite boys school Kings Row on scholarship, Nicholas quickly finds out that Seiji is his roommate. The comic book was first announced by Boom! Studios in August 2017 to be published under their Boom! Box imprint in November. Pacat was inspired to create Fence due to her love for the sport, which she practiced in high school, and her interest in sports manga like Haikyu!!.

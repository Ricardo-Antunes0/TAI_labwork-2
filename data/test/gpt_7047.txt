Uyaquq (also Uyaquk or Uyakoq; sometimes referred to as "the man with the big nose") is a figure in Inuktitut mythology. He is the son of Ukkujjuarjuk and the brother of Ipiuji.  He was banished from his home by his brothers for stealing a piece of meat. Uyaquq wandered for many years before he came to a shore where he met a woman who offered him food. He accepted and then went to sleep. The woman took him to her home, where she made him her husband. Uyaquq then had a son, whom he named Qaujuq.  One day, Uyaquq's brothers found out about his new family and came to visit. Uyaquq's wife greeted them politely, but Uyaquq was angry and refused to let them in. His brothers argued with him until he finally allowed them in. However, as soon as they were inside, Uyaquq's wife attacked them with an axe, killing them all. Uyaquq then fled the house and returned to the ocean.

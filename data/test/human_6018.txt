Minertown-Oneva, also known as Minertown, in Forest County, Wisconsin is a historic logging camp built in the early 1900s by Wilbur and Henry T. Miner. It's in the vicinity of Carter, Wisconsin. According to the National Park Service: In 1899, brothers Wilbur and Henry T. Miner from Vernon County, WI, purchased a 4,000 acre tract in Forest County, Wisconsin, where they constructed a sawmill and related settlement known as Minertown. The settlement included a boarding house and company store for those employed by the Miner Lumber Company, as well as a planing mill, roundhouse, depot, store, a blacksmith shop, a cook shanty, several small four-room houses, and a barn. In 1931, the mill was destroyed by fire and the remaining community was subsequently abandoned. Today, the Minertown-Oneva site is significant for its potential to provide information relevant to late nineteenth century settlement of Forest County, as well as the history of Wisconsin's hardwood logging era.

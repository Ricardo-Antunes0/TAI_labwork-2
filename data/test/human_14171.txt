Bhawaiya is a musical form or a popular folk music that originated in Northern Bengal, especially Rangpur Division in Bangladesh, Cooch Behar district of West Bengal, India and Undivided Goalpara district of Assam, India. A "working class" music, with the recurring figures of mahouts (elephant trainers and catchers), mahishals (buffalo herders) and gariyals (cart drivers) the lyrics of these songs express pangs of separation and loneliness of their womenfolk,  with elongated tones accentuating pain, longing and "deep emotion".  Generally believed to have originated in the 16th century under the Koch king Vishwa Singha, it has evolved into stage performances since the 1950s and more widely since the 1990s. The lyrics of Bhawaiya songs are non-denominational. Origin of the name Bhawaiya There are various explanations of the meaning of Bhawaiya. Low-lying land with shrubs and other vegetables are called Bhawa. Buffalo keepers used to sing this song while ploughing. Hence the name Bhawaiya came to exist. According to some other researchers, Bhawaiya is derived from the word Bawaiya, which is subsequently derived from the word bao (breeze). The derivative of the word Bhawaiya is Bhav > Bhao + Iya = Bhawaiya. So the derivative meaning of this word is emotionally charged. According to Abbas Uddin, a notable singer and composer of Bhawaiya song, this song is like the random and pleasant wind blowing of North Bengal and it is named as Bhawaiya. According to a survey( conducted by the Folk cultural and tribal cultural centre, Government of West Bengal) among the performers of Bhawaiya song the name is derived from the word Bhao > Bhav. These songs carry a deep "emotion" of biraha or separation and loneliness.

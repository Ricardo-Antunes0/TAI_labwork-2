Hong Kong Watch is a non-governmental organisation that provides legal and other assistance to refugees and asylum seekers who have fled their homes because of war, persecution, or violence.   Founded in 1999, Hong Kong Watch provides a range of services including advice on asylum procedures, representation at hearings, and assistance with housing, health, education, and employment. The organisation has a caseload of around 1,000 clients and employs a staff of ten full-time lawyers and two support staff.   Hong Kong Watch is funded by donations from individuals, foundations, and corporate sponsors. In 2013 the organisation received funding from the United States Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs to support the work of its Refugee Protection Project.

James Henry Neel Reed (April 28, 1884 â€“ July 6, 1937) was an American blues and jazz composer, pianist, and singer. He was one of the most influential figures in the development of bebop jazz.  Reed was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of a physician. He began playing the piano at age six, studied music at the Peabody Conservatory and played with local ensembles in his teenage years. In 1910 he made his first recordings with Columbia Records, and in the 1920s he became one of the leading blues musicians in Chicago. He moved to New York City in the 1930s, where he became a leading figure in the emerging bebop movement. He died from a heart attack at the age of 53.  In 2002, Reed was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

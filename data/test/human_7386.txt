Zoe Hanna  is a fictional character in BBC's medical drama Casualty, portrayed by Sunetra Sarker. She first appeared in the series twenty-two episode "Take a Cup of Kindness", broadcast on 29 December 2007. The character was a consultant in emergency medicine at Holby City Hospital's emergency department. Sarker chose to take a temporary break from the show in 2014 and Zoe departed from the show in the series 28 episode "A Life Less Lived", broadcast on 23 August 2014. She returned in the series 29 episode "Return to Sender", broadcast on 25 October 2014. Sarker later decided to leave the series indefinitely, but producers asked that she did not announce her departure in order to surprise viewers. After over 8 years on-screen, Zoe departed the series in the series 30 episode "Hello, I Must Be Going", broadcast on 7 May 2016. It was confirmed in September 2017 that Zoe would return for a single episode. She appeared in the nineteenth episode of series 32, broadcast on 13 January 2018. Zoe was described as a "maverick rebel-with-a-cause" and a "good doctor" who "knew what she was talking about" by Sarker. Sarker had portrayed nurses in previous roles who were billed as loveable, sweet girls and preferred playing a feisty character. Zoe enjoys being a doctor and prefers saving lives than working on paperwork, which influenced her decision to step down as clinical lead in 2014. Zoe's personal life is featured frequently in the series and Sarker described Zoe as "kooky" outside of work, but focused upon entering resus.

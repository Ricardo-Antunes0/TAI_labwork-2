Jonathan Castroviejo Nicolás (born 27 April 1987) is a Spanish professional cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam . Career Born in Getxo, Basque Country, Spain, Castroviejo spent two seasons with the feeder team of the de facto Basque national squad Orbea, before he joined  in 2010. He won his first race as a professional at the 2011 Tour de Romandie, clocking the fastest time in the  prologue individual time trial, beating reigning under-23 world champion Taylor Phinney by 0.27 seconds. The result came the day before Castroviejo's 24th birthday. His prowess in the time trial was relatively uncommon for a  rider, as the team was known for fielding lightweight climbers with little ability against the clock. The Romandie stage win was, however, not a complete shock – earlier in the season, Castroviejo had finished eighth in the time trial which closed out Tirreno–Adriatico, besting the times of riders such as Gustav Larsson, Cadel Evans, and David Zabriskie, all of whom had reputations as time trial specialists. Castroviejo turned in another strong time trial later in the Tour de Romandie, taking ninth in the  long race against the clock, better than Marco Pinotti and Jean-Christophe Péraud (among others), both former champions of their respective nations in the time trial.

La Falange , also known as FE/La Falange, is a Spanish political party registered in 1999. The party originated as a split of the Falange Española de las JONS, led by Gustavo Morales and Jesús López. Ideologically the party claims to be a successor of the original Falange Española of the 1930s, and follower of the ideas of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, Ramiro Ledesma Ramos, Onésimo Redondo and Julio Ruiz de Alda. History  FE/La Falange was founded in 1999 after a split in FE-JONS, that was the result of an internal conflict between the faction of Diego Márquez Horrillo and the faction of Gustavo Morales. Finally, the first one won and the sector that supported Morales left FE-JONS. In the local elections of 1999 the party gained three town councillors. Since 2000-2001 the party adopted more xenophobic positions, in contrast to traditional falangism. Due to this ideological changes, a sector known as Falange Auténtica split in 2002.

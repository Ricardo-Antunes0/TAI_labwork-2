The Leighton Brothers (alt. "Leighton and Leighton") were a British architectural firm of the late Victorian and Edwardian eras. The two brothers, Henry Leighton (1855–1941) and Edwin Leighton (1860–1941), were the leading architects of their day, designing some of the most famous and iconic buildings in Britain, including the Royal Albert Hall, Windsor Castle and Manchester Town Hall.  The Leighton Brothers were born in 1855 and 1860 in the market town of Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, England. The family had a tradition of building and repairing churches. In 1870 the brothers moved to London to study at the Architectural Association School of Architecture. After graduation, they set up their own practice in 1883.   The Leighton Brothers quickly became one of London's leading architectural firms. They designed many iconic buildings in Britain during the late Victorian and Edwardian eras, including the Royal Albert Hall (1897), Windsor Castle (1898), Manchester Town Hall (1907), and Lloyds Bank Tower (1912). Their work is often characterized by its ornate style, with a strong emphasis on symmetry and proportion.  The Leighton Brothers died in 1941 and 1941 respectively. They are buried in Brookwood Cemetery in Wokingham, Berkshire.

CP3 is a disability sport classification specific to cerebral palsy. In many sports, it is grouped inside other classifications to allow people with cerebral palsy to compete against people with other different disabilities but the same level of functionality.  Compared higher number CP classes, they have increased issues with head movement and trunk function.  They tend to use wheelchairs on a daily basis though they may be ambulant with the use of assistive devices. Sportspeople in this class are eligible to participate in a number of sports on the elite level.  They include athletics, cycling, skiing, swimming,  wheelchair tennis, archery, wheelchair fencing, wheelchair curling, table tennis, shooting, sailing, powerlifting, para-equestrian, rowing and archery.  In some of these sports, different classification systems or names for CP3 are used.  Because CP3 sportspeople use wheelchairs in most of the classes they compete in, they need to attend classification events while in their wheelchair to insure they do not get classed in an ambulatory class.

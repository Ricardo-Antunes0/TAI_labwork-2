Mark Wetmore (born June 29, 1953) is an American cross country and track coach who specializes in middle-distance and long-distance running. He began his collegiate coaching career when he was accepted as a volunteer assistant coach at the University of Colorado in 1992. Since then he became one of the most successful and longest-serving coaches of any collegiate program in the United States. Coaching career Wetmore first began coaching in the 1970s in his hometown, Bernardsville, New Jersey, when he was offered to be the municipal children's team coach. He eventually named the team "Edge City Track Club" in 1972, after being inspired by Tom Wolfe's book The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, which discusses the hippie counterculture and living on the periphery of existence. Eventually, the group expanded, when Wetmore began coaching the children's parents in running. Eventually the group expanded so much that it included runners aged from 8 to 60. The group became colloquially known as the Mine Mt. Road Department. Subsequently, he was offered a summer position at his own former school, Bernards High School, as an assistant cross country coach, along with his own former coach Ed Mather. He spent fourteen years coaching at Bernards High before getting his first collegiate coaching offer.

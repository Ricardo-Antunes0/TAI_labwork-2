The Twelve Tables were a set of regulations and laws written in Latin by a committee of Roman lawyers in the 4th century BC. The Twelve Tables were a fundamental part of the Roman legal system and remain a model for law today. They were divided into two groups, the "tables of contents" and the "tables of remedies". The tables of contents dealt with civil law, such as contracts, property rights, and inheritance; while the tables of remedies dealt with criminal law, including crimes against property, kidnapping, and murder.  The Twelve Tables are often considered to be one of Rome's most important achievements in jurisprudence. They were influential in the development of common law systems around the world, and are still studied by lawyers today.

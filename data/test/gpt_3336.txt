Three Visions is a 1935 suite in three movements by the American composer Aaron Copland.  The work is scored for vibraphone, piano, and string quartet and is dedicated to the composer's friend and fellow émigré, the pianist and composer Darius Milhaud. The three movements are: "Largo", "Allegro", and "Andante".  Copland was commissioned to write a new work for the 1935 season of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and submitted Three Visions in March 1935. The premiere took place on April 15, 1935, with the Philadelphia Orchestra under the direction of Leopold Stokowski.  The suite has been recorded many times, including a complete performance on CD by the Vienna Symphony Orchestra led by Riccardo Muti with soloists Rebecca Luker, Gianandrea Noseda and Pinchas Zukerman, released in 1990 on the Philips label.

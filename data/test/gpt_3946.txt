Gogglebox is a British reality television series on BBC One. The show was first broadcast on 28 October 2011, and consists of a group of friends watching television while eating snacks.   The show is filmed in a living room, and the friends are usually people who have not had any contact with one another for some time. They are required to watch a selection of television programmes that have been voted for by the public, and they are given between one and three hours to give their opinions on them.   The series has been met with mixed reactions from the public; some find it amusing, while others find it tedious.

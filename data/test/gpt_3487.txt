Erich Werdermann (2 March 1892 – 20 March 1967) was a German actor and film director.  Werdermann was born in Berlin, the son of the actor Gustav Werdermann and his wife Bertha (née Löwenthal). After attending the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium, he studied acting at the Berlin Academy of the Arts. He made his stage debut in 1916 at the Schiller Theater.  Werdermann began his film career in 1921 with a minor part in the comedy film "Die lustigen Weiber von Dresden". He became more prominent after appearing as Professor Kranz in Ernst Lubitsch's "Die Fledermaus" (1925), for which he was awarded the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival. He appeared in more than fifty films over the following decade, often playing character parts.  In 1933, Werdermann fled Germany because of his Jewish heritage. He appeared in a number of films during the 1930s and 1940s, but was mostly inactive due to World War II. He made a brief return to acting after the war, appearing in such films as "The Lost Weekend" (1945) and "The Ghost Writer" (1948).  Werdermann died in 1967 at the age of 78. His last film was "The Boys from Brazil" (1961).

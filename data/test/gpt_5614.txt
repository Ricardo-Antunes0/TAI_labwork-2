She studied sculpture at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem, graduating in 1966.  Chemel's early works were sculptural installations that used everyday objects such as plumbing pipes and chairs as construction materials.

Her most recent work often incorporates environmental elements into her installations, such as water droplets or windblown leaves.   Chemel has exhibited her work around the world, including at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, and the Kunsthaus Bregenz in Austria. She has also been awarded numerous prizes, including the prestigious Heinz Award for sculpture in 2003.

Dog Mountain rises above the north side of the Columbia River Gorge in the U.S. state of Washington. The base of the mountain is in Skamania County along Washington State Route 14, about  east of Stevenson and  east of Vancouver. From its base at , it climbs steeply to an elevation of . The mountain is the site of a popular hiking trail that begins on the north side of Route 14 at milepost 53. The  trail winds through heavy forest to meadows and the site of a former fire lookout. After climbing steeply for about the first half mile (0.8 km), the trail splits into two forks that meet again at the summit. The lookout was built in 1931 and reconstructed in 1952 to watch for fires across the river in Oregon's Mount Hood National Forest. Outmoded by surveillance from roads and airplanes, the fire lookout was dismantled in 1967.

The Los Angeles Meteorite is a martian meteorite that was found on October 14, 1937, in the city of Los Angeles in California. The meteorite is made up of approximately 84% iron and 16% nickel-iron. It is the largest and most expensive meteorite found in the United States, and the second-largest meteorite found in North America.  The Los Angeles Meteorite was first discovered by two women who were walking their dog near the Griffith Park Observatory. The two women happened to notice a bright light in the sky, and when they got closer they realized that it was a meteorite. The meteorite was later examined by a scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who determined that it was from Mars. The Los Angeles Meteorite is currently on display at the Valentine Museum in Fullerton, California.

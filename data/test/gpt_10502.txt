The Macmillan Committee, officially known as the Committee of Imperial Defence, was an influential group in British politics during the Second World War. The Committee was chaired by Sir John Simon, and played a critical role in the formulation of British defence policy.  The Committee was established on 10 September 1939, shortly after Britain had declared war on Germany. Its purpose was to provide strategic advice to the government on all matters relating to the war, including military strategy, manpower requirements, and supply lines. The Committee also formulated policies on rationing, labour supply, and civilian morale.  The Committee was dissolved on 31 December 1945, shortly after the war had ended. Its work helped to shape the postwar British economy and military establishment.

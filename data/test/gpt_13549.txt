Navekat or Nevkat  was an ancient Mesopotamian goddess who was worshipped in the city of Uruk. She was considered the patron goddess of the wool trade, and her temple was dedicated to the god Ereshkigal.  Navekat is known from a few references in ancient Mesopotamian literature, but little else is known about her. She is sometimes associated with the god Enki, and it is possible that she was a moon goddess. Her symbol was a reel of woolen yarn, and she was often depicted holding a distaff or a spindle.

"Love" is a song recorded by Romanian singer Inna for her debut studio album, Hot (2009). It was released as the second single from the record on 16 February 2009. Written and produced by Play & Win members Sebastian Barac, Radu Bolfea and Marcel Botezan, "Love" is an EDM and house track. Its lyrics revolve around the potential complications related with love. The song was described as containing high-pitched vocals by one reviewer, as well as compared to the work of English rock band New Order. Another critic foresaw the single to be commercially successful. It was aided by an accompanying music video, which was uploaded onto label Roton's official YouTube channel on 7 May 2009. The clip was filmed near Bucharest, Romania by Bogdan BÄƒrbulescu and portrays a fight between good and evil. For further promotion, Inna also performed "Love" at the Bulgarian event Loop Live in October 2009. Commercially, the song reached the top ten of the charts in Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Hungary.

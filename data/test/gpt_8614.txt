Many travellers in Lombard Italy during the Middle Ages noted the peculiar form of the Lombard dialect spoken in the city of Milan. These travellers, who were mostly Greek or Latin speakers, called this dialect Lombard syllogae or Lombard speech.  Lombard syllogae differed markedly from the dialects spoken in other parts of Italy. For one thing, it was much more monosyllabic than other dialects. Furthermore, Lombard syllogae was marked by a number of phonological features that were not typical of any other Italian dialect. This led many linguists to believe that Lombard syllogae was a unique form of speech that was somehow related to the language of the Lombards themselves.  However, it was not until the late nineteenth century that scholars began to seriously study Lombard syllogae and determine its true origins. It was then that they discovered that Lombard syllogae was actually the dialect of Milanese Italians, a group of people who had migrated to Milan from central Italy sometime during the Middle Ages.

Sachse  is a city in Collin and Dallas counties in the U.S. state of Texas and is part of the DFW metroplex.  An eastern suburb of Dallas, the city population was 20,329, as of the 2010 census with an estimated population of 26,046 people today.  Sachse is located off Texas State Highway 78 and is approximately  north of the President George Bush Turnpike (Texas State Highway 190) and Firewheel Town Center. History Sachse was founded by William Sachse, a European immigrant from  Herford, Prussia (included modern-day Germany, and parts of Poland and Eastern Europe), in 1845. Purchasing  from Collin County, Sachse erected the first cotton mills and gins in the county. After Sachse gave 100 feet of frontage through all of his holdings to the railroad in 1886, the railroad built a depot on the frontage and named the town Sachse. Since the depot was labeled 'Saxie', many old legal documents referred to the city as 'Saxie'. The flaw was later corrected. The word Sachse comes from the German word for Saxon.

Agatha Lin, born in Qinglong in the Guizhou of southeast China in 1817, was a Chinese saint and martyr.  She was a headmistress and catechist, and one of the first to evangelize the Miao people.  She was beheaded for her faith on January 28, 1858.  Agatha was beatified by Pope Pius X on May 2, 1909, and canonized in 2000.  Her feast day is February 18. Early life  Agatha Lin, born Lin Zhao, was born in the village of Machang in the Qinglong district of Guizhou in 1817. Her father was a salt merchant, and both parents, who were "fervent Christians", had been converted to Christianity by Zhang Dapeng. Agatha was baptized when she was three days old, though her father was in prison at the time for refusing to renounce his Catholic faith. Her parents taught Agatha to read and write, and her mother trained her to become an expert in needlework. When she was young, Agatha took "a private vow of virginity". (Her patron was Agatha of Sicily, who was martyred in the 3rd century.) Her parents, however, had betrothed Agatha to a man while she was a child, according to custom, but they agreed to annul the marriage when she was 18 because she had consecrated her life to God.  A priest, Matthew Liu, advised Agatha's father to send her to Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province, to study at the school for girls founded and run by the consecrated virgin Annie Yuan of Sichuan.

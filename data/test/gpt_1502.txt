In social science, antipositivism (also interpretivism, negativism, or antirealism) is a philosophical perspective that rejects the positivist notion that knowledge is based on verified facts.  An antipositivist outlook typically entails a rejection of the scientific method, and instead favors interpretive or hermeneutic approaches to understanding the world. In general, antipositivism is opposed to the idea that knowledge can be acquired through observation and experimentation.

Mozambique is a country particularly hard-hit by HIV/AIDS. The country had an estimated prevalence of 0.24% in 2012, the highest in the world.  HIV/AIDS was first reported in Mozambique in 1984. By 1990, there were over 1,000 cases and by 2009, the number of cases had increased to over 25,000. The majority of cases are among men who have sex with men and women who are sexually active outside of marriage. In 2012, there were 11,000 children living with HIV/AIDS in Mozambique.  There are few treatment options available for people with HIV/AIDS in Mozambique. Treatment is expensive and not always available. The country has made progress in increasing access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), but still has a long way to go.  Mozambique is a significant source of refugees and asylum-seekers seeking refuge from HIV/AIDS-affected countries. In 2012, over 10,000 people were living with HIV/AIDS as refugees or asylum-seekers in other countries.

Bertrand Bisimwa is a Congolese rebel and warlord who has been active in the Democratic Republic of Congo since the 1990s. He is known for his attacks on government and military targets as well as for his involvement in the smuggling and trafficking of arms and minerals.  Bisimwa was born in 1964 in the town of Butembo in the eastern province of North Kivu. He joined the Congolese army in 1985 and served throughout the First Congo War (1998-2003). He deserted the army in 2003 and formed a rebel group, the National Congress for the Defense of the People, which he led until 2007. Bisimwa then went into exile in Uganda, where he was arrested in 2009 and extradited to the DRC. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for war crimes and crimes against humanity by a military court in Kinshasa in 2013.

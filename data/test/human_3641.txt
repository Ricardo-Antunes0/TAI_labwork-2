The Hungarian Communist Party (, abbr. MKP), known earlier as the Party of Communists in Hungary (, abbr. KMP), was a communist party in Hungary that existed during the interwar period and briefly after World War II. It was founded on November 24, 1918, as Party of Communists in Hungary, and was in power between March and August 1919 when Béla Kun ran the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic. The communist government was later overthrown by the Romanian Army, Kun was exiled to Vienna and later he including many other communists moved to Moscow and during those years membership was becoming smaller every year. During World War II the party changed its name to Peace Party but only a year later in 1944, they embraced a new name which they will hold until 1948. After the war, they regained power and their membership rose up quickly which led to Mátyás Rákosi suppressing other parties in the country besides the social democrats (which were aligned with them) to form a one-party state. In 1948, the party merged with the social democrats to form the Hungarian Working People's Party which became the next ruling party of Hungary. It was also a member of Comintern and its successor Cominform.

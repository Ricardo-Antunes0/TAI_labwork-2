In Māori tradition, the canoe Horouta was said to be created by the god Tane. It is said that Tane used his magic to create the Horouta from the materials of the earth, sky and sea.   The Horouta is a large, double-hulled canoe first constructed in New Zealand in the early 1800s. It was a highly prized possession for Māori and played a significant role in their culture and way of life. The craft was used for fishing, trading and travel, and was believed to be able to navigate through the seas and skies. The Horouta is now a rare sight, and few remain in operational condition.

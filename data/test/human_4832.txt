The Rising Card is a popular category of magical illusion in which the magician causes randomly selected playing cards to spontaneously rise from the center of a deck. Many variations of this trick exist and are performed widely. The effect can be accomplished using a variety of methods and techniques, ranging from pure sleight of hand to complex electronic and mechanical solutions. Variations  Magician Howard Thurston is attributed with creating a unique take on the Rising Card. As described by Smithsonian Magazine:One, called the "Rising Card," started with an audience member choosing certain cards, as if for a regular card trick. But expectations turned upside down when Thurston put the deck into a glass goblet. He would then call up certain cards—the king of spades, the ten of clubs—and they would rise two feet in the air, into his hands. The dazzling end was when all 52 cards were thrown, serially, into the audience. One reporter wrote that they fluttered to audience members "like beautiful butterflies."A similar variation is attributed to magician and inventor Samuel Cox Hooker. This version includes cards rising from the deck and floating in air beneath a glass bell jar. This complex, multi-stage iteration of the Rising Card effect was reenacted by John Gaughan in 2007 and has inspired curiosity and speculation as to the methods behind it.

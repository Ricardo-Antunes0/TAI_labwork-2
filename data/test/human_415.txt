First National Bank of SA Ltd v Lynn NO and Others is an important case in South African contract law, especially in the area of cession. It was heard in the Appellate Division by Joubert JA, Nestadt JA, Van den Heever JA, Olivier JA and Van Coller AJA on 19 September 1995, with judgment passed on 29 November. M. Tselentis SC (with him AC Thompson) was counsel for the appellant; MJD Wallis SC (with him LB Broster) appeared for the respondents. Cession  Cession is a particular method of transferring rights in a movable incorporeal thing in the same manner in which delivery (traditio) transfers rights in a movable corporeal thing. It is in substance an act of transfer (Afrik oordragshandeling) by means of which the transfer of a right (translatio iuris) from the cedent to the cessionary is achieved. The transfer is accomplished by means of a transfer agreement (oordragsooreenkoms) between the cedent and the cessionary arising out of a iusta causa from which the former's intention to transfer the right (animus transferendi) and the latter's intention to become the holder of the right (animus acquirendi) appears or can be inferred. It is an agreement to divest the cedent of the right and vest it in the cessionary.

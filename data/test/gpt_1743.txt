"The Hudson" is a song by Scottish band Suede, written by Brett Anderson and produced by the band themselves. It was the first single from the band's third album, Nerve.  The song was released in late 1993 and reached number 18 in the UK Singles Chart. The song has been described as "a moody and atmospheric ballad" that "laid down a sonic blueprint for Suede's future."  A music video was filmed to promote the single, and it features lead singer Brett Anderson looking moody and atmospheric in a dark room.

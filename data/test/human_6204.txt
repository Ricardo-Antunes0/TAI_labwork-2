In 1880, the British colonial administration of Cyprus created a Gendarmerie force, the Cyprus Military Police (CMP). Popularly known as zaptiehs (from Ottoman Turkish for "policeman", and the designation used for the force that the CMP replaced), this body numbered about 700 men, organised in both mounted and foot units. The force's personnel were predominantly drawn from the minority Turkish Cypriot population, although prior to 1914 about a third were Greek Cypriots. The eight most senior officer positions were normally filled by secondment from the British Army. While trained to undertake some police duties, the force had an essentially military character. Mounted zaptiehs, armed with carbines and sabres, were portrayed in contemporary illustrations patrolling rural roads in twos. A detachment of mounted zaptiehs participated in Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee celebrations of 1897, where their fezzes and blue and scarlet zouave-style jackets attracted much attention. By 1907 the zouave uniforms had been replaced by khaki drill for ordinary duties, although the fezzes were retained.

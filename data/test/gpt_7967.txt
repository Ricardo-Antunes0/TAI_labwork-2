1000 Crore Club is an unofficial designation for a group of businessmen and women in India with net worth of over one billion Indian rupees (US$128 million). The term has been used in the media to describe those who are among the wealthiest people in India.  The club was first mentioned by Indian business magazine Forbes in its annual billionaires list in March 2014. According to Forbes, the 1000 Crore Club is constituted of "a select group of predominantly Hindu business families, many of whom have been able to amass their fortunes through shrewd real estate investments and industrial conglomerates". The list includes families such as the Ambani, Birla, Godrej, and Mittal families. In March 2015, the club was again mentioned by Forbes, this time in its annual list of the world's richest people. This time, the club included investors such as Mukesh Ambani (head of Reliance Industries) and Azim Premji (head of Wipro).   There is no formal membership criteria for the 1000 Crore Club. However, some common characteristics shared by members include a family background in business, a strong network of friends and colleagues, and a focus on efficiency and quality over scale.

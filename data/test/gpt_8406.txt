In astronomy, axial tilt, also known as obliquity, is the angular difference in the Earth's rotational axis inclination from its orbital plane. The tilt is currently 23.4 degrees, which is the result of the Earth's obliquity oscillation over a period of about 4.6 million years.  Axial tilt is one of the two primary factors that determine climate on Earth; the other is its distance from the sun. The tilt affects Earth's climate by altering the amount of sunlight that reaches different parts of the planet. It also affects Earth's ocean currents, which in turn affect climate patterns all over the world.

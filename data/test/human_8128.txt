Vyatcheslav Kagan-Paley, also known as Slava ("Слава" Каган-Палей), is a Russian born, Israeli countertenor, male alto and baritone. As a child, he studied violin and piano. In 1976, he won the first television and radio competition for young performers in Minsk, as a singer. Kagan-Paley continued his violin studies at the Belarusian State Conservatory, and, in 1987, he began singing at the Belarusian Academic Capella. This same year he made his debut as a soprano soloist in Schumann's Requiem with the Leningrad Philharmonic. Two years later, Dr. Irina Antonova, the director of the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow, invited Kagan-Paley to give a recital there, and this resulted in several engagements including The Vienna State Opera, various recordings and television appearances. Slava’s fifth solo recital was recorded live by Melodia at the Astrakhan International Vocal Festival (named in honor of the great Russian singers Barsova and Maksakova) which included music by Caccini, Bach, Handel and songs by Brahms, R. Strauss, and Mahler’s “Kindertotenlieder”. The talents of the young singer were greatly appreciated by Leonard Bernstein who, after meeting him in St. Petersburg in the summer of 1989, planned to arrange joint performances; unfortunately, the Maestro's untimely death put an end to these plans.  Kagan-Paley was soon after awarded a grant by the Oppenheimer Charitable Trust, and from 1989 to 1992 he completed the post-diploma vocal training course under Professor David Pollard at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. In 1993 the Opera Course was completed. In the same year Slava attended Masterclasses with Graham Johnson and Geoffrey Parsons . His opera debut, in 1992, as Oberon in Benjamin Britten's “A Midsummer Night's Dream” at the Guildhall was greeted with great public and critical acclaim.

Giles v. California, 554 U.S. 353 (2008), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that held that for testimonial statements to be admissible under the forfeiture exception to hearsay, the defendant must have intended to make the witness unavailable for trial. Factual background The defendant Dwayne Giles was charged with murdering his girlfriend.  During the trial, prosecutors were able to introduce statements made by Giles' girlfriend to police about a domestic violence incident between her and Giles.  Giles was convicted, and his conviction was affirmed by the California Supreme Court.  The court reasoned that the report of domestic violence should be admissible under the forfeiture rule codified in California Evidence Code ยง 1370 because Giles had presumably made the declarant unavailable by murdering her.  Generally, the girlfriend's statements to the police would be inadmissible as out-of-court hearsay, but the testimony was admitted due to an exception to the hearsay rule which allows the admission of out-of-court statements by a witness when the defendant has made that witness unavailable to testify in court.  The Supreme Court granted certiorari.

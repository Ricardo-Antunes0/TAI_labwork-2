Fistula Foundation is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization focused on treatment of obstetric fistula, funding more repair surgeries than any other organization, public or private. As of February 2021, they support hospitals and doctors in over 20 countries across Africa and Asia. The Foundation is dedicated to treating obstetric fistula by covering the full cost of fistula repair surgery for poor women who would otherwise not be able to access treatment. They also provide fistula surgeon training, equipment and facility upgrades that make fistula treatment as safe as possible, post-surgery counseling and support for healed patients. The Foundation has been recognized by several organizations for its transparency, effectiveness and efficiency, earning a top "A" rating from Charity Watch and a four star rating from Charity Navigator for 15 years in a row, placing it in the top 1% of charities reviewed on the site. The Foundation has also been selected as one of 22 charities recommended by Princeton Professor Peter Singer's organization, The Life You Can Save. The organization's cost-effectiveness was also noted by GiveWell in 2019. History  Fistula Foundation was founded in 2000 by Richard Haas and his daughter Shaleece Haas, who both left the organization in 2005. It is headquartered in San Jose, California, and has offices in Kenya and Zambia. Since its inception, the organization has raised more than $108.5 million from donors from more than 81 countries. Until 2008, the Foundation supported only the work of the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital in Ethiopia, founded by the late Dr. Catherine Hamlin and her husband Reginald Hamlin. In 2009, the Foundation expanded its mission from funding only that hospital to addressing fistula treatment globally. Since then, they have supported projects in a total of 32 countries across Africa and Asia. Since expanding their mission in 2009, they have provided more than 55,000 surgeries.

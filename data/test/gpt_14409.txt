The 50th Operations Group was a component of the United States Air Force's Strategic Air Command during the Cold War.  The 50th Operations Group was activated on 1 July 1955 at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, as one of SAC's original four wings. The group initially assumed responsibility for all SAC ICBM operations. In 1957, the wing received B-36 Peacemakers from the United States Air Force Reserve and assumed their training and maintenance responsibilities. The wing also assumed responsibility for SAC's second-line bomber force.  In 1962, the wing began Operation Dominic, the first USAF program to place nuclear-capable aircraft on alert at overseas bases. The 50th also participated in Operation Chrome Dome, the clandestine operations that brought nuclear weapons to Cuba in 1962 in an effort to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime.  The 50th Operations Group was inactivated on 30 September 1966 at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. Its responsibilities were transferred to the 31st Operations Group which had been activated on 1 July 1955 at MacDill.

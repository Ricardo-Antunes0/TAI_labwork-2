New Australians were non-British migrants to Australia who came from countries in the south-east and south Asia. They arrived in large numbers after World War II, when Australia began to accept refugees from European countries.  The arrival of New Australians has had a significant impact on Australian culture and society. They have brought with them new customs and traditions, and have introduced new foods and styles of cooking to Australia. New Australians have also been responsible for developing many of the country's major industries, including tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing.

Bayesian statistics is a theory in the field of statistics that seeks to apply the principles of probability and statistical inference to data sets with uncertainty. It provides a framework for incorporating prior knowledge into probabilistic model building and for incorporating new information into existing models.  Bayesian statistics has been used in fields such as engineering and medical research, where Bayesian methods have been shown to be more accurate than traditional methods. Bayesian methods are also commonly used in machine learning, where they are used to build models of data sets.

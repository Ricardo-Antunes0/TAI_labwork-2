The Bartel BM.4 was a Polish biplane primary trainer aircraft used from 1929 to 1939 by the Polish Air Force and Polish civilian aviation, manufactured in the Samolot factory in Poznań. It was the first plane of Polish design put into production. Design and development The aircraft was designed by Ryszard Bartel in the Samolot factory in Poznań. It was a development of the Bartel BM.2, which did not advance beyond the prototype stage.  Thanks to a lower weight than the BM.2, it could use lower-powered engines, so its performance was actually improved.  Its performance was also superior to the Hanriot H.28, used by the Poles and licence-built by Samolot.  The BM.4 prototype was flown on 20 December 1927 in Poznań. It had good handling and stability and was resistant to spinning.  A distinguishing feature of all Bartels was an upper wing of a shorter span, because lower and upper wing halves were interchangeable (i.e. the lower wingspan included the width of the fuselage).

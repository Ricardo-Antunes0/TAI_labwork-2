David Mercer MacDougall (; 8 December 1904 â€“ 13 May 1991) was a Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong between 1945 and 1949. In 1928, while a Cadet Officer, MacDougall was seconded to the Colonial Office, and posted to Hong Kong. By 1941 he was part of the Ministry of Information (MoI) in Hong Kong. The Chinese Nationalists had worked undercover with the British Police and Intelligence Services since the Japanese invasion of Southern China in 1938, running a network of Nationalist agents which Admiral Chan Chak had operated. These helped in keeping the local Chinese population on-side, controlling the Triad gangs and identifying Japanese sympathisers. During the Battle of Hong Kong he worked directly with Admiral Chan Chak who had been brought in to assist in matters of the Chinese public morale and civil order within the British colony. MacDougall and Chan were among a total of sixty eight British, Chinese and Danish intelligence, naval and marine personnel saved from the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong by a dramatic break-out in five small torpedo boats on Christmas Day 1941. Eventually making it to Chungking, MacDougall then travelled on to Burma.

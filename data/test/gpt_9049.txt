The G-less cassette transcription assay is a molecular assay used to detect the presence of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in biological samples.  The G-less cassette transcription assay uses a PCR-based method to detect the presence of GPCRs in biological samples. The assay is based on the principle that the activation of a GPCR will result in the transcription of specific genetic sequences.

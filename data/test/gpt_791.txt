William Smith (16 September 1817 â€“ 22 October 1884) was an English architect who is considered one of the leading architects of the Victorian era. He was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England and died in London.  Smith was educated at the Royal Academy Schools, London, from which he graduated in 1839. He then apprenticed with the architect George Edmund Street, before establishing his own practice in 1845. Smith's early work was in a Gothic style, but he soon developed a distinctive style of his own, characterised by a reliance on natural materials and a restrained use of ornamentation.  Smith became one of the most prominent architects in London, and his work is found in many of the city's most important historical buildings, including Buckingham Palace, St Paul's Cathedral, and the Victoria and Albert Museum. He also designed several prestigious public buildings, such as Cheltenham Town Hall and Blackpool Tower.  Smith was a prolific writer on architecture, and his publications include books on design theory and practice as well as articles for various architectural journals. He was also a member of several professional bodies, including the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and the Royal Society of British Architects (RSBA).

The South African Civil Cooperation Bureau (CCB), formerly known as the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC), is an independent statutory body that promotes and protects human rights in South Africa.  The CCB was created on 14 June 1994, through the amalgamation of the South African Human Rights Commission and the South African Commission for Unlawful Discrimination. The CCB is a national organisation with a mandate to promote and protect human rights in South Africa through research, education, public awareness and litigation.  The CCB's work focuses on five core areas: human rights education; monitoring and investigating human rights violations; providing support to victims of human rights abuses; promoting reconciliation and social justice; and advocating for human rights at international level. The CCB also provides free legal aid to people who have been affected by human rights violations.  The CCB has a staff of over 100 full-time employees, and operates from its headquarters in Johannesburg. The CCB also has regional offices in Durban, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Natal, Bloemfontein and Pretoria.

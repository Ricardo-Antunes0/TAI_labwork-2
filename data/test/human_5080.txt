The National is a Welsh daily news website owned by Newsquest and former compact newspaper. Gavin Thompson is the editor, while three journalists – audience and content editor Michael Sweet and reporter Gareth Axenderrie – have been taken on to work for the title; Rachel Nurse, another reporter, died in October 2021. Unlike the Scottish outlet of the same name, The National takes no political stance and claims to simply be "pro-Wales". It became a weekly newspaper from 17 April 2021. History The National was founded by Huw Marshall, who wanted to "challenge the dominant incumbents who provide news from a UK perspective". Thompson said the media landscape in Wales struggled to match that of Scotland, where the public have the choice between several national newspaper titles as well as Scottish editions of UK papers. He said, "Wales doesn't really have that in the same way and we really feel it should. It's really been very stark during the Covid pandemic where a large number of people take their news from sources that are writing it from an English perspective."

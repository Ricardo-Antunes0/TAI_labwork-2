Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) standards are the technical specifications for digital television transmission in the United States. The ATSC standards were developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) in collaboration with the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) and the Entertainment and Technology Industry Association (ETIA).  The main goals of ATSC standards are to ensure compatibility among different television receivers and to promote innovation in television technology. In addition, the standards establish a framework for future enhancements to digital television.  The first version of ATSC standards was released in 1996, and the most recent version was released in 2013.

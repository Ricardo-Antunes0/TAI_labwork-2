. Fixation or visual fixation is the act of focusing on an object or image enough to make it seem more real. It can be achieved by voluntary control or involuntary physiological responses.  Fixation is an important part of vision because it allows an observer to take in a larger area of the visual field at once, and to process the information more quickly. In a crowded environment, it can help us avoid collisions. It also enables us to focus on specific objects or details in a scene.  Visual fixation can be divided into two categories: voluntary and involuntary. Voluntary fixation is when we choose to focus our attention on an object or image. Involuntary fixation happens automatically, without our involvement. This includes our eyes' tendency to stay fixated on a moving object for a certain period of time, or our brain's response to sudden changes in the visual environment.  Fixation can have different effects on different people. For example, some people find that they are more likely to remember information if they focus on it voluntarily. Other people find that they are better able to read text if they keep their eyes fixed on the page for a certain period of time.

A Web mapping or an online mapping application displays a graphical representation of data on a Web page. It enables users to explore and query data in a spatial context, and to create maps with a variety of mapping tools.  Web mapping has been used by organizations to improve their understanding of their business operations, customers, and competitors. It can also be used to plan new business strategies or to diagnose problems.   Mapping tools used in Web mapping include GPS (global positioning system) mapping, image mapping, GIS (geographic information system) tools, and database mapping.

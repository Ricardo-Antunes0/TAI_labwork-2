Apprehended shortly after the murders, Schoenwetter confessed and pleaded guilty to all charges. He was sentenced to death on December 5, 2003. At the time of his sentencing, he became the youngest person on death row. His death sentence was overturned in 2021 and he was resentenced to life. Killings  On August 12, 2000, Randy Schoenwetter rode his bicycle from the apartment he shared with his mother in Titusville, Florida, to the restaurant where he worked. A short time later, he left the restaurant and headed to the home of his friend, Chad Friskey, with the intent to rape one of Friskey's sisters. Around 5:00Â am, Schoenwetter entered the house through a sliding glass door and armed himself with a 12-inch knife from the kitchen. Finding 16-year-old Theresa Friskey's bedroom locked, Schoenwetter entered Virginia's room. While he was in her room, she woke up and screamed. He held his hand over her mouth and threatened her, but she continued to scream. When she recognized him and said his name, Schoenwetter began to leave, but Virginia's parents, Ronald and Haesun, caught him. A struggle ensued and Schoenwetter fought them with the knife. He then returned to Virginia's room and killed her, because she had recognized him. Theresa heard the commotion and called 911. Ronald managed to get outside and was seen by neighbors, who called 911 when they saw that he was injured; he later died from his wounds. Haesun was critically injured, but survived.

Anna L. Clapp (1814â€“1889) was the only president of the St. Louis Ladies' Union Aid Society and helped supply for those wounded during the American Civil War. She advocated for women to step outside of their homes and join the efforts to help during the war. She made medical supplies available for injured soldiers and provided shelter for refugees of all color as well. Even when the war was over, she continued to make a difference by creating homes for women and orphans. She was president of the Western Female Guardian Home and the director of the St. Louis Protestant Orphan Asylum. Early life  Anna L. Clapp was born on August 15, 1814. Anna's maiden name was Wendell. She was born in Cambridge, New York and is of Dutch descent. For three years, she was a teacher in Newburgh, New York. Her desire to do good started before the American Civil War. She served as the treasurer for the Industrial School Association. The Industrial School Association was created in 1854 to provide food, shelter, and education to orphan children. At the age of twenty four, she married Alfred Clapp who was an enterprising merchant. They resided in Brooklyn, New York up until the American Civil War began. Mrs. Clapp and her husband emigrated to St. Louis, Missouri. The reason for the couples move is unknown, but they found the right place to put Anna's benevolent nature into action. Every public building was overwhelmingly taken over by wounded soldiers and the St.Louis area was in desperate need for help. Shortly after arriving in St. Louis, Anna discovered the St. Louis Ladies' Union Aid Society and her efforts to help those in need during the American Civil War began.

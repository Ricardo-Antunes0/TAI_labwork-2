Iphigenia (minor planet designation: 112 Iphigenia) is a large and dark main-belt asteroid, approximately 140 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on October 17, 1892, by German astronomer Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory.  Iphigenia is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids. It is also a member of the Hebe family, together with the larger asteroids Ceres and Pallas.  Iphigenia has a relatively high albedo, indicating that it is a very dark body. It is probably composed mostly of carbon-rich materials, like most other members of the Flora family.  Iphigenia is probably not a threat to Earth's environment, as it is not likely to collide with our planet any time in the foreseeable future.

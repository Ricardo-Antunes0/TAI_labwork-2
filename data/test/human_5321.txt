Solar Ash is a science fiction adventure platforming game developed by Heart Machine and published by Annapurna Interactive. It was released on December 2, 2021 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5. The game's story explores themes of trauma and moving on from dramatic, devastating life events. It also happens to be set in the same fictional universe as Heart Machine's first and previous game, Hyper Light Drifter, but there are no direct connections between the two games' stories. Gameplay Solar Ash is an adventure platforming game. The player controls the main character Rei, a Voidrunner within a black hole known as the Ultravoid, through a bright-neon colored, three-dimensional landscape, avoiding obstacles and attacking enemies with energy slashes and a phase-shifted and hard light sword, as Rei tries to save her planet. The game's focus is less about combat and more on movement, as lead developer Alx Preston stated "We're traversal first. That was kind of the vision of the game: Control the traversal, the environments that you're moving through, and the spectacle of it all. Especially the scale on the grandiosity of it just feeling impossibly large and you're feeling really tiny and insignificant in as many ways as possible. The traversal absolutely takes precedence and the combat is kind of intermingled with that traversal."

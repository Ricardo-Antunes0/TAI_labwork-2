Dukes Meadows is a riverside park in Chiswick, London. The land was purchased from the Duke of Devonshire in 1923. A seaside-type promenade and a bandstand were built alongside the riverfront and opened by the Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI) in 1926. In 1998 a group of local people formed the Dukes Meadows Trust to protect the interests of the park. The land in 1902 consisted of orchards and meadows, with a farmhouse. A plan was made that year to build homes for 40,000 people on the site, in a new town called Burlingwick, but they were never built. In 1914 the Brentford Gas Company introduced a bill in Parliament to build a gasworks over 80 acres of the meadows; Chiswick residents objected to the plan, and the bill was not passed. In 1923 Chiswick Urban District purchased the land to create a park. To finance the purchase, gravel extraction took place from 1924 to 1937; the gravel pits were not restored until after 1948 when they were restored and filled in.

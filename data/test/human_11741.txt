Road Trip Adventure, also known as Road Trip or Choro Q HG 2 (often mislabeled as Road Trip: Arcade Edition), is a racing adventure video game for the PlayStation 2 developed by E-game (but commonly credited to Takara). The game was released in 2002 in Japan by Takara, in North America by Conspiracy Entertainment, and in 2003 in Europe and other PAL regions by System 3 under their Play It label. The game combines elements of racing and adventure games, and is widely considered to be the best of the Choro Q series due to its large seamless world which the player can freely explore. The game takes place in a world of anthropomorphic cars that interact like humans. As part of the PS2 Classics release, Road Trip Adventure was released on the PlayStation Store for the PS3 in Europe on February 15, 2012; however, it was not released on the American PSN.

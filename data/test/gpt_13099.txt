The Whole30 is a 30-day elimination fad diet that restricts grains, legumes, dairy, sugar, and processed foods. Advocates claim that the diet is effective for weight loss and general health, and that it is better than other popular diet plans such as Atkins or Weight Watchers.  The Whole30 was created by Melissa Hartwig in 2009. She was inspired to create the diet after she became sick and tired of following popular diets that didn't work for her. Hartwig believed that a simple, 30-day elimination diet could help her regain her health.   To follow the Whole30, participants must abstain from all grains, legumes, dairy, sugar, and processed foods for 30 days. There are no restrictions on what type of food can be consumed during the diet; however, some people recommend consuming organic foods to maintain optimal health.   The Whole30 is not a fast or easy diet to follow; participants must be dedicated to following the rules closely. Many people report great success following the Whole30; however, some people do have difficulty sticking to the restrictions.   The Whole30 has been criticized for its lack of scientific evidence. There is little research demonstrating that the diet is effective for weight loss or general health; therefore, it is difficult to make informed decisions about whether or not to follow the diet.

The dam was completed in 1936 and is owned and operated by the ACT Government. It is a popular tourist destination.  The Woronora Dam was constructed as part of the Central Australia Scheme, a campaign to provide water supplies for the mining and agricultural industries in the outback of central Australia. The dam was designed by Sir John Latham and built by the Commonwealth Government's Public Works Department. It is a concrete gravity dam with a height of 183 metres, a length of 910 metres, and a width of 33 metres. The reservoir it creates, known as Lake Woronora, has a capacity of 3,000 megalitres.  The dam and reservoir are popular tourist destinations. The lake is used for boating, fishing, swimming, and windsurfing. The dam is also used for hydroelectricity generation.

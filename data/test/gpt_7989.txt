Medical tourism refers to people traveling abroad for medical treatments, such as surgery. It has become a growing industry, with many people traveling to countries with high-quality medical systems.  Medical tourism can be beneficial for both the patient and the country they are visiting. Patients may be able to obtain treatments that they could not otherwise afford, while countries can receive tourism dollars that can help finance other economic initiatives. However, medical tourism can also have negative consequences. Patients may be exposed to unsafe or unproven treatment methods, and countries may be unable to provide the same level of healthcare for all citizens.

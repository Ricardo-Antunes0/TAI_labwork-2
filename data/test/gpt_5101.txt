Ilaq  was a medieval region in the Arabian Peninsula. It included present-day Yemen and much of Saudi Arabia.  Ilaq was the seat of a number of ancient Yemeni kingdoms including the Sabaean Kingdom, the Himyarite Kingdom, and the Kindah Kingdom. It was also the location of two important trade routes, one linking it to Hadramaut and the other linking it to Oman. In pre-Islamic times, Ilaq was known as "Yemen Arabi".  Ilaq was eventually conquered by the Quraish tribe in the late 7th century AD. The region subsequently came under Muslim rule, and remained so until the advent of colonialism in the early 20th century.

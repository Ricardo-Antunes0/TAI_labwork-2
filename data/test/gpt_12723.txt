Toddler nutrition is the description of the nutritional needs of toddlers, which may vary depending on their age, sex, activity level, and weight.  Toddlers are growing and developing rapidly, which can make their nutritional needs very different from those of adults. Many of the nutrients that are important for toddlers' development are also crucial for their health in later life.  There is no one-size-fits-all approach to toddler nutrition, but a balanced and varied diet that includes plenty of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and protein is essential. Toddlers also need fluids and energy to stay healthy and active.  If you're looking for information on specific toddler nutrition topics, such as breastfeeding, formula feeding, and food allergies, you can find links to more detailed guides on the Nutrition Facts label or online.

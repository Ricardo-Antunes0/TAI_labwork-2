The concept of a linewidth is borrowed from the fields of physics and engineering. It is a measure of the width of a periodic waveform, typically in terms of cycles per second (Hz).  An oscillator linewidth is important in a variety of applications, such as communication systems, radar, and sonar. It can be used to determine the frequency response of an oscillator or to measure the stability of an oscillator system. Additionally, it can be used to characterize the noise behavior of an oscillator.

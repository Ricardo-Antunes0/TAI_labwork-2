The Pearls Naval Brigade was formed on 11 September 1857 when 175 officers and men of Royal Navy ship  formed a Naval Brigade which operated ashore during the Indian Mutiny with the Gurkhas and Sikhs providing artillery support. The Pearl and the frigate   were despatched from Hong Kong to Calcutta in July 1857 after receiving news of the rebellion. En route, they rescued the crew of the transport HMS Transit, which wrecked off Bangka Island, Sumatra. The Brigade engaged in numerous actions against the rebel forces and most notably in the campaign that led to the Relief of Lucknow. They fought alongside a similar brigade formed by the crew of the Shannon, which was captained by William Peel , son of Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel and Victoria Cross recipient. The Shannons brigade landed a considerable force of mobile guns and rifle companies, while the Pearls Naval Brigade deployed mostly rifle companies. Capt. Peele took his men rapidly inland to Allahabad and Cawnpore, but he was severely injured at the Siege of Lucknow.

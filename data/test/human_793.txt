Spongites yendoi is a species of crustose red seaweed with a hard, calcareous skeleton in the family Corallinaceae. It is found on the lower shore as part of a diverse community in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Description Spongites yendoi is a hard, encrusting species of coralline algae. Like other species it contains chlorophyll and uses photosynthesis to synthesize carbohydrates. The cell walls of the algae contain deposits of calcium carbonate which give it its firm consistency. The thallus of Spongites yendoi is relatively thin and is mainly composed of filaments of small, squarish cells. The lowermost layer is up to eight filaments thick and these cells are mostly elongate. The cells are often fused. The tetrasporangial conceptacles are elliptical and have a single pore. Old conceptacles do not become buried as the thallus grows. The colour varies but may be some shade of grey or chalky white. Its range in South Africa extends further north than that of the pear limpet Scutellastra cochlear and when ungrazed by this limpet it is thicker and more knobbly.

The 1976 World Series was the championship series of the National League (NL) and American League (AL) of Major League Baseball (MLB) in 1976. The NL champion Philadelphia Phillies and the AL champion Oakland Athletics competed for the title, with the Phillies winning the series 4 games to 3.  The Phillies had lost the previous three World Series, but this time they were led by pitcher Jimmy Rollins and second baseman Cesar Cedeno. The Athletics relied heavily on their pitching staff, with starters Vida Blue, Dave Stewart, and Ken Holtzman combining to win twenty-one games. The playoffs began with a three-game sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals, followed by a four-game loss to the Mets in the Division Series.  The Phillies then defeated the Reds in five games in the National League Championship Series (NLCS), and Oakland lost the ALCS to Boston in six games. This was Philadelphia's fourth championship, and first since 1971.

Inqawe is the Xhosa term for the traditional smoking pipe used among the Xhosa people. The pipes come in many variations but are mostly made from Acacia caffra or ‘mnyamanzi’ wood which is taken from the hook thorn tree commonly found in the Eastern Cape. Xhosa men and women (including non-smokers) carry a pipe in a beaded tobacco bag called ‘inxili’ as part of their traditional attire when they attend rituals and traditional functions. The longer smoking pipes are used by senior Xhosa women. These long pipes are called ‘uzalipholile’ meaning ‘it arrives cooled’ which refers to the cooling effect that drawing the smoke through a long stem has. The higher the status of the woman in the community, the longer the stem of her smoking pipe. Xhosa women can have pipes with stems that are up to 30 cm in length.  Younger people of both sexes usually use a slim pipe of medium length. The shorter pipes are smoked by men.

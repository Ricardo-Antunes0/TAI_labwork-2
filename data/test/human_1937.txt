Capitol Punishment: The Hard Truth About Washington Corruption From America's Most Notorious Lobbyist is a non-fiction 300-page memoir by former American lobbyist Jack Abramoff, published by WNDbooks in November 2011. The book, described as an "account of his political triumphs, serial lawbreaking and unethical conduct" by The Washington Post, details the author's life in Washington as a power broker and lobbyist. In its last chapter, titled "Path to Reform", Abramoff lists a number of proposals to eliminate bribery of government officials. Abramoff wrote Capitol Punishment in four weeks, as he states, after having served four years in a federal prison for corruption connected to his lobbying. When asked why he wrote the book, he said in an interview: "When I was in prison, I started thinking about how to fix the system that is there. Because, obviously, throwing Jack Abramoff in jail didn't clean up the system", adding "I had something to give back, some way to make some recompense for what I was by telling what is going on in Washington – from the point of view of somebody who rose very high in that industry – and what goes on behind those doors, and how horrible it really is."

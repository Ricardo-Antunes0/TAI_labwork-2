John Kannenberg (Milwaukee, WI) is a multimedia artist, curator, writer, and researcher who creates quietly reflective work that investigates the sonic geography of museums and archives, the psychology of collection, the processes of making and observing art, and the human experience of time. His art practice emphasises process, creating and breaking rules for the work's realisation in ways that blur the boundaries between intention and accident. Since 2015, Kannenberg has been Director and Chief Curator of The Museum of Portable Sound, a hand-held museum of curated sounds currently accessible to visitors in the greater London area.

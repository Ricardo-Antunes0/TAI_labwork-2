Floss Casasola, MBE, OD (1903â€“1991) was a British artist, sculptor and printmaker.  Casasola was born in 1903 in Parma, Italy. She was the daughter of an artist, and began her art education at the age of twelve. She moved to England in 1923, and began her career as a sculptor. Her first major commission was for a statue of Queen Victoria for the Royal Exchange in London.  Casasola's prints are known for their expressive use of colour and light. She is particularly well-known for her series of prints entitled "The Garden of Earthly Delights", which was inspired by the paintings of Michelangelo. The series was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1954, and has since been exhibited around the world. Casasola died in 1991.

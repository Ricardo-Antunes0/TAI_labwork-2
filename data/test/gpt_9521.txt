The Haynesville Shale is an informal, popular name for an extensive shale formation in north-central Louisiana, extending into northeastern Texas. The Haynesville Shale is a sedimentary rock formation that was formed over a period of about 177 million years. It is made up of several different types of shale, including the Benton Shale, the Fayetteville Shale, and the Haynesville Formation. The Haynesville Shale is one of the most productive shale formations in the United States, and it has been responsible for the production of oil and gas reserves since the late 1800s.

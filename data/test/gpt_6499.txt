The Tsyklon-2 (Cyclone-2), also known as Tsiklon-2 or Chel-2, is a reusable spacecraft that was jointly developed by the Soviet Union and the United States. It was the first spacecraft to be designed primarily for reentry and landing, and remains the only spacecraft ever to have been successfully returned to Earth after launch.  The Tsyklon-2 was first flown in 1974 and became operational in 1976. It was used for a variety of scientific missions, including studies of the Earth's atmosphere, magnetosphere and radiation belts, as well as the exploration of the Moon, Mars and Venus. After 25 years of service, the Tsyklon-2 was retired in 1998 and is now on display at the Russian Museum of Space History in Moscow.

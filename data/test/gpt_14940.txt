Adversus Judaeos ( Kata Ioudai≈çn, "against the Jews") is a book of Christian scripture, traditionally attributed to the Apostle Paul.  The book's title is derived from the opening words of the text: "Adversus Iudaeos" (literally: "against the Jews"). The book is traditionally divided into three parts: The First Adversus Judaeos, The Second Adversus Judaeos, and The Third Adversus Judaeos.  The First Adversus Judaeos is mainly a polemic against Jewish religious beliefs and practices. The Second Adversus Judaeos concentrates on the issue of circumcision. The Third Adversus Judaeos concerns the issue of dietary laws.

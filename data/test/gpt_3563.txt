Phrygillus, was an ancient Greek artist, who lived in the first half of the fifth century BC. He is chiefly famous for his paintings of flowers and fruit, which are among the finest examples of realism in ancient painting.  Phrygillus was born in the city of Sicyon in the central Peloponnese and died in Athens. Little is known about his early life, other than that he came from a well-to-do family. He began to practise painting around 470 BC, when he was probably in his mid-20s. His early paintings were probably copies of earlier works, but he soon began to experiment with new techniques.  Phrygillus became one of the most popular and highly respected painters in Greece. He was commissioned to paint portraits of important people, such as the tyrant Hippias of Samos and the politician Cimon. He also painted religious scenes, such as The Judgement of Paris, which is one of the best-known works from antiquity.  Phrygillus's later works are less well known, but include a series of paintings called The Seasons, which show a variety of plants and flowers in different stages of growth. He also produced a number of landscapes and seascapes. Despite his fame and popularity, Phrygillus died relatively poor and unknown.

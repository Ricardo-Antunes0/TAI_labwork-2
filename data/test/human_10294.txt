In computer network protocol design, inter-server communication is an extension of the client–server model in which data are exchanged directly between servers. In some fields server-to-server (S2S) is used as an alternative, and the term inter-domain can in some cases be used interchangeably. Protocols  Protocols that have inter-server functions as well as the regular client–server communications include the following:   IPsec, secure network protocol that can be used to secure a host-to-host connection   The domain name system (DNS), which uses an inter-server protocol for zone transfers;   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP);   FXP, allowing file transfer directly between FTP servers;   The Inter-Asterisk eXchange (IAX);   InterMUD;   The IRC, an Internet chat system with an inter-server protocol allowing clients to be distributed across many servers;  The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP);  The Protocol for SYnchronous Conferencing (PSYC);  SIP, a signaling protocol commonly used for Voice over IP;  SILC, a secure Internet conferencing protocol;  The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP, formerly named Jabber).  ActivityPub a client/server API for creating, updating and deleting content, as well as a federated server-to-server API for delivering notifications and content.  SMTP which accepts both MTU->MTA traffic, as well as MTA->MTA, but it is usually recommended that different ports are used for these actions

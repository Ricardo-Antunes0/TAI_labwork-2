Tom Paterson is a Scottish comic artist who drew characters for Fleetway in 1973â€“1990, and D.C Thomson from 1986 to 2012. As of 2013, he currently draws strips for Viz. He lives in Leith, with three children, and is a Hearts supporter. Taking stylistic inspiration from Leo Baxendale's work on The Bash Street Kids, Paterson's talent as a cartoonist was discovered at the age of sixteen by original Dandy editor Albert Barnes, who was impressed with the cartoon samples Paterson had sent to him. Barnes offered the young artist a chance to collaborate with him on a strip called The Dangerous Dumplings (which would later be retooled as The Doyle Family for the Dandy), which was to become the leading strip of a new comic Barnes was developing, but the project was scrapped  when Barnes retired and Paterson was hired to work for IPC after leaving school. When Baxendale left IPC to publish his own work, Paterson took over as artist for several of his strips, including Sweeny Toddler and Grimly Feendish. Many of his comic strips feature a single, striped sock standing upright on the ground that appears once in each story that acts as a trademark.

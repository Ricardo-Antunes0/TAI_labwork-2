In configuration management, a baseline is an initial, or "golden," configuration of a system or network. Baselines provide an agreed-upon starting point for managing changes, and can be used to compare current conditions with desired states.  Configuration management is the process of ensuring that the various elements of a computer system are configured to meet the needs of their users and the organization. In particular, configuration management ensures that systems and networks are configured to meet the specific needs of their users and the organization's mission. Configuration management also ensures that changes to systems and networks are made in a controlled and consistent manner.  Configuration management is used in a variety of applications, including computer systems, telecommunications networks, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, and large distributed systems. It is also used in many different industries, including manufacturing, government, and finance.  Configuration management is a critical component of information technology (IT) infrastructure management. Configuration management not only ensures that systems are configured to meet the needs of users, but also monitors changes to system configurations to ensure that they are made in a controlled and consistent manner. This helps ensure that systems are reliable and remain operable in the face of changing demands.

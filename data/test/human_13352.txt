The Battle of Vernon, Florida was a minor skirmish of the American Civil War that took place on September 28, 1864, near the town of Vernon, Florida.  Coming a day after the larger Battle of Marianna, this conflict involved a company of Home Guard troops from Vernon who were going to the aid of their Confederate compatriots in that city.  Unbeknownst to the Southerners, their route had taken them straight toward the withdrawing Federal column under Brigadier General Alexander Asboth, which was returning to their main base at Pensacola after their victory at Marianna.  The two forces met on a wooden bridge across Hard Labor Creek in Washington County; refusing to heed Union demands to disperse, the badly-outnumnered Floridians chose to resist and were quickly defeated, with most of them being taken prisoner. Prelude In the summer of 1864, Florida Governor John Milton ordered the creation of Home Guard units in the state's counties.  Located in the Florida Panhandle, Washington County had few men of military age who were not already in Confederate service, invalids or too old or young to fight.  Additionally, some country residents had already defected to the Federals, including the county Sheriff  With barely thirty available men, the local Home Guard company chose Second Lieutenant W.B. Jones, a veteran of the 6th Florida Infantry who had been discharged for wounds received in Tennessee, to lead them.  Upon learning of the approach of Federal forces, Confederate commanders in Mariana had sent out messengers to nearby towns and villages, asking them to come to their aid with all possible speed.

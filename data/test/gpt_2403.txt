The expressive therapies are the use of different forms of communication, art, and bodywork as tools to help people communicate emotions and feelings. These therapies can be used to help people work through difficult personal relationships, cope with difficult life events, or manage stress.  Expressive therapies are often used in combination with other treatments such as medication or counseling. They can be helpful for people who have difficulty expressing their emotions or who feel that their emotions are getting in the way of their lives.  The most common expressive therapies are talk therapy, art therapy, and bodywork. Talk therapy is typically used to help people deal with issues such as anxiety, depression, and stress. Art therapy is used to help people express themselves through painting, sculpture, or other creative mediums. Bodywork is often used to help people deal with physical pain or tension.

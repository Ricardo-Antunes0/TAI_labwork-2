Dichomeris melanota is a moth in the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Walsingham in 1911. It is found in Mexico (Veracruz). The wingspan is about . The forewings are slightly lustrous, bluish black, with inconspicuous darker, dull black markings. There is an outwardly oblique streak, arising on the fold at one-third of the wing-length, but not quite reaching the costa before the middle. There are also some minute transverse striae along the dorsum, and a triangulate transverse streak, arising from the costa at three-fourths, pointing outward toward the rather suddenly depressed and angulate apex, then sharply bent inward making two adjacent points directed toward the upper angle of the cell, and again descending with a slight outward curve to the tornus, before which there is a minute ochreous marginal spot. The hindwings are dark brownish fuscous, with a pale ochreous line along the base of the more greyish fuscous cilia.

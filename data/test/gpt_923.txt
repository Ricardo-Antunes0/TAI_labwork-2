Jean-Marc Boivin (6 April 1951 – 17 April 2017) was a French mathematician. He was a professor at the University of Montreal and a Fields Medalist.  Born in 1951 in Paris, Boivin earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Paris in 1973, and his doctorate from the University of Paris in 1977 under the direction of François Lemaître. He then taught at Université libre de Bruxelles (1978-1983), Université de Montréal (1983-1989), and the University of Montreal (1989-2017).  He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1994, and became a professor at the University of Montreal in 1998. He retired from his position at the university in 2017.  His research has focused on differential geometry, algebraic geometry, and symplectic geometry, particularly problems in PDE theory and geometric partial differential equations.  He died on 17 April 2017 at the age of 71.

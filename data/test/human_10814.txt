NationsUniversity, also known as Nations University or NationsU, is a private Christian university in New Orleans, Louisiana. It only offers distance education and focuses on "the development of faith and the training of Christian leaders around the world." While NationsUniversity's founding faculty and many of the staff are affiliated with the Churches of Christ, NationsUniversity itself is a nondenominational online Christian university, which offers certificates, bachelor's and master's degrees in religious studies, and a Master of Divinity (M.Div.) degree. History NationsU was incorporated in 1996 by Richard Ady, Mac Lynn, and Darrell Frazier. Ady and Lynn had been college classmates. Ady's career had been in church work and Lynn had worked in higher education as a teacher and administrator. Ady had previously founded the World English Institute.   Gathering volunteers who would travel around the globe, conducting courses and seminars in religious studies, was the plan.  As time progressed, around two hundred volunteers were conscripted now lending their assistance.  As the group's activity strengthened, the demand for religious degree programs strengthened. Therefore, the organization became officially incorporated in Louisiana on July 19, 1996 as NationsUniversity.

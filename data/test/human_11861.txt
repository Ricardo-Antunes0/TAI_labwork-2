Feminist is an adventure story arc of the Philippine comic strip series Pugad Baboy, created by Pol Medina Jr. and originally published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer. This particular story arc lasts 34 strips long. In 1994, the story arc was reprinted in PB5, the fifth book compilation of the comic strip series. Synopsis The Pugad Baboy ladies and gentlemen engage in a battle of the sexes precipitated by conversations Debbie has with Tomas' ultra-feminist wife, Barbie. The argument centers on the question of which is the weaker sex and on Filipino sexual stereotypes and gender roles. Things come to a head when Dagul and Tomas notice that their wives had been absent from home every night. They track the two women to a Muay Thai dojo, much to their surprise and dismay. The women also receive instruction on Tae Kwon Dog (a play on Tae Kwon Do) from Shin Dong Pol. In retaliation, the men quit their jobs and devote their time to Pao's beauty parlor and playing Mahjong.

Silly Symphony Swings is a Wave swinger attraction in Paradise Gardens Park at the Disneyland Resort in California. Themed to Disney's 1935 short film The Band Concert, Mickey Mouse conducts from high atop the attraction, synchronized with the music. Although The Band Concert was not part of the Silly Symphonies film series, the name was applied to the attraction as a result of its symphony storyline. Closely following the plot of The Band Concert the main column of the ride rises, revealing a tornado which spins the riders to the tune of the William Tell Overture and William Tell's "Storm". Once the tornado safely passes, the music comes to an end and the ride slows and lowers riders to the ground. It is speculated that the new voice of the Silly Symphony Swings is that of the fictitious Mr. Tinkershmidt, the supposed new owner of Paradise Pier. Tinkershmidt  and the Silly Symphony Swings update was part of the multi-year, $1.1 billion (US) expansion plan for Disney's California Adventure Park. Previews of the attraction were offered at California Adventure's Walt Disney Imagineering Blue Sky Cellar. The attraction soft-opened on May 28, 2010, an official grand opening on June 11, 2010.

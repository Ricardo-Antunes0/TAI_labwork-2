Fix the Debt is a group of executives and former legislators who campaign for deficit reduction and tax reform. The Campaign to Fix the Debt was founded in July 2012 by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson. In September 2012 they wrote, "If we can't get members of Congress to put aside their ultra-partisanship and pull together rather than apart, we face the most predictable economic crisis in history." The Campaign comprises a variety of socio-economic and political views and engages business and government leaders alongside American citizens. Leadership Fix the Debt is chaired by Judd Gregg and Edward Rendell. In March 2017 they wrote of rising national debt, "Both parties have contributed to the problem, and leaders in both are unwilling to ruffle feathers and make the tough choices needed." They said of gross national debt exceeding $22 trillion in February 2019, "This milestone is another sad reminder of the inexcusable tab our nation's leaders continue to run up and will leave for the next generation."

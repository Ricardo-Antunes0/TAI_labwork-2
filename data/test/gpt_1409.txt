Kyeshi ("suspend", medical timeout) is a term used in Japanese medicine to describe a temporary interruption of the life-sustaining functions of the heart or lungs. It is usually used when a patient is deemed to be in serious condition but does not require immediate surgery or intensive care.  Kyeshi is most often used for patients with acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, or respiratory arrest, but can also be used for other medical conditions. Kyeshi may be performed in a hospital or at home.  The length of time that a patient spends under kyeshi will vary depending on the severity of the condition and the patient's age. Most patients are released from kyeshi within a few hours, but some may stay under kyeshi for up to several days.

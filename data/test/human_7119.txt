Rhonda Brady (born July 10, 1959 in Gary, Indiana) (later taking the married surname Anderson) is a former American track and field athlete.  She was primarily known for running short hurdle races but was also successful as a sprinter.  Shortly after finishing her junior year at Calumet High School in Gary, Indiana, she qualified to represent the United States at the 1976 Olympics in the 100 meters hurdles.  She was unable to get out of her qualifying heat that included the eventual gold and bronze medalists.  She was the youngest to qualify for that team at the 1976 Olympic Trials where she won her race against more experienced competitors. The following year she won the Indiana State High School Championship in the 100 meters.  She was the three time United States Junior Champion in the hurdles.  She still ranks #5 on the Indiana state 100 meters list, with Maicel Malone and Candyce McGrone ahead of her on that list.  And in the 100 meters hurdles she remains a clear #1, more than a third of a second ahead of the next best.

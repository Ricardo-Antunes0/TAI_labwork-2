The Meadows is an area of Nottingham, England which has been designated as a conservation area.  The Meadows was originally undeveloped agricultural land, and was used for grazing by horses and cattle until the early 1800s. It was then used for growing crops, notably wheat, until the late 1800s. In 1848, the Nottingham Corporation began to develop the land into a public park, and it opened to the public in 1857. The original design for the park was by Joseph Paxton, but he died before it could be completed. The park was landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux.  The Meadows is home to a number of attractions, including the Albert Memorial Clock Tower and the Botanical Gardens. The Meadows is also home to Nottingham Trent University's Robert Gordon University Campus.

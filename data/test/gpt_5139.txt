Perfluorocarbon emulsions are emulsions containing either bubbles of perfluorocarbon gas or droplets of perfluorocarbon liquid. They are often used as foams, gels, or liquids for spraying and are generally non-toxic.  Perfluorocarbon emulsions were first developed in the early 1960s as a replacement for oil-based aerosols. They have a range of applications, including air purification, firefighting, and refrigeration. In some cases, they are even used in food packaging.

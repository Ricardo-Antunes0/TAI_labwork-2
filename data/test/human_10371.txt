Cala Bona is a small fishing town and holiday resort on the east coast of Majorca in the Balearic Islands of Spain. It consists of a cove with a harbour and surrounding coastal area, and lies within the municipality of Son Servera. The population of the town in 2005 was 1,088 inhabitants. In 2011, it had a population of 1,258. It is located to the north of Cala Millor, to which is connected by a promenade, and it lies to the south of Port Verd. Fodor's 1989 guide to Spain described Cala Bona in these terms: "Once an unspoiled fishing village, but now overwhelmed by neighboring Cala Millor. Mixed rocky and excellent sandy beach." History Before the beginning of the tourist boom, Cala Bona was a village in a small natural harbour between Cap d'es Pinar and the peninsula of Punta de n'Amer. At that time the village only consisted of a pair of houses where a few families lived by fishing. The fishermen worked on the harbour and at sea, rowing and sailing their lla√ºts (small traditional Catalan wooden boats) to the surrounding rocky promontories, following the breeding lobsters. In 1924 the first guest house opened, a place called "Cap Cupe" which later became the "Hotel Cala Bona".

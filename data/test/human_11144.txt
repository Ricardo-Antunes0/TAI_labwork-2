He flew Nakajima B5N torpedo bomber from the carrier Sōryū during the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the Indian Ocean Raid and the Battle of Midway. He is most notable for having released the torpedo that eventually sank the battleship California during the Attack on Pearl Harbor. He was shot down and lost his right hand during the Solomon Islands Campaign while flying from the carrier Jun'yō, but survived the crash and was eventually evacuated to Japan. Early career Jūzō Mori was born in on 9 February 1917 in a small town in Saitama Prefecture to a poor farmer family. He wanted to become a teacher but the family could not afford the entrance fee for the school. He then moved to Tokyo to live with his uncle. He found him a job in the department store, while at the same time he attended a night school. However, in January 1935 his father died and he was forced to return to his home town in order to support the family. In August he noticed a navy recruiting poster and decided to join the Imperial Japanese Navy. He passed the entrance test in January 1936 but almost failed the physical exam as his chest measurement was too small. He enlisted the navy as a pilot and in June left for Yokosuka naval base to start the basic training. In November he transferred to Kasumigaura Training Naval Air Station (NAS) near Tokyo to begin pilot training. He graduated from the 38th class in 1938 and specialized for torpedo bombing.

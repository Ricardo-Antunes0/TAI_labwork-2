Pandita Roos Telaumbanua (30 September 1919 â€“ 24 February 2009) was a New Zealand hermit and teacher.  Telaumbanua was born in 1919 in the town of Wairoa, near Napier, New Zealand. She was the youngest of four children. Her father, a carpenter and farmer, died when she was young, and her mother struggled to provide for her and her siblings. At 15, Telaumbanua left school to help support her family.  In 1944, Telaumbanua met a monk named Bhikkhu Bodhi at a Buddhist temple in Napier. Bodhi taught her about the Buddha's teachings and how to meditate. She soon became interested in Buddhist philosophy and practice and decided to become a nun. However, Telaumbanua was not accepted into the monastic community and instead decided to become a hermit.  Telaumbanua began living as a hermit on the side of a hill near Wairoa in 1949. She lived there for the next 47 years, attracting disciples who came to see her teach and meditate. Telaumbanua spent much of her time reading Buddhist scriptures and practicing meditation.  Telaumbanua died on 24 February 2009 at the age of 91 after suffering from dementia for many years.

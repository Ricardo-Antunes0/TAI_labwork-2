Victor Haim Perera (1934 - 14 June 2003) was an author and journalist primarily concerned with Latin America and Sephardic Jewry. He was best known for his history of the Sephardic Jews, The Cross and The Pear Tree (1995), which traced the path of his own family from 15th-century Spain to 20th-century Guatemala. Personal life Perera was born in Guatemala to Sephardic Jewish parents. After the end of the Second World War, the family left an increasingly dangerous Guatemala for Brooklyn, New York. Perera studied at Brooklyn College, and went on to study English at the University of Michigan. There he met, and in 1960 married, Padma Hejmadi, an Indian writer/artist and Hindu. The marriage, which caused a rift in his family, broke down in 1972, and Perera moved to California. In his writing, he expressed his belief that his family was suffering under a curse for leaving Palestine two generations earlier.

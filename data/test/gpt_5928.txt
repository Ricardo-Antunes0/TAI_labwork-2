Boris Andreyevich Mozhayev (Борис Андреевич Можаев, June 9, 1928 – August 18, 2003) was a Russian physicist who made significant contributions to the fields of elementary particle physics and high-energy physics.  Boris Mozhayev was born in Leningrad, Soviet Union on June 9, 1928. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Leningrad in 1948 and his doctoral degree from Moscow State University in 1954. He worked at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) from 1954 to 1984, where he served as the head of the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics (LTP). In 1984 he moved to the University of Alabama in Huntsville, where he became a professor in 1985.   Mozhayev made significant contributions to the fields of elementary particle physics and high-energy physics. His work in elementary particle physics focused on the study of particles called quarks, which are made up of three quarks. His work in high-energy physics focused on the study of particles called neutrinos, which have very high energy and are difficult to detect.

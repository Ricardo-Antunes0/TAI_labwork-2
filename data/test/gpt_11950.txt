Golding Bird (9 December 1814 – 27 October 1883) was an English poet. He is best known for his poem "The Rape of the Lock" which has been frequently anthologized and is included in the Oxford English Dictionary.  Golding was born at a time when the town of Reading in Berkshire was growing rapidly, and the family moved frequently between Reading and Windsor until he was eleven years old. He attended Reading School before being apprenticed to a draper. In 1833, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics and classics, but he abandoned his studies after two years to become a clerk in a solicitor's office. In 1836, he married Louisa Anne Fox; they had two daughters.  In 1841, Golding abandoned his law career to become a tutor at Eton College. In 1851, he became a schoolmaster at Harrow School, where he remained until his death. He also wrote poetry during this time and published two volumes of poetry: "The Pied Piper of Hamelin" (1848) and "The Temple of Apollo" (1850).  Golding's first wife died in 1857; two years later, he married Agnes Holland. They had one son and one daughter. Golding died in London at the age of 72

PizzaExpress Jazz Club is a jazz club located on the first floor of PizzaExpress, a chain of restaurants in the United Kingdom. The club is open every night from 7pm to 12am, and features live jazz music performed by a variety of jazz artists. Admission is free for all guests, and the club is open to anyone who wants to hear live jazz music.  PizzaExpress Jazz Club was opened in 2007 by saxophonist and composer Simon Cottle, who was inspired to open the club after hearing a live performance at another jazz club. Cottle wanted to create a place where people could come and enjoy live jazz music without having to pay an extra fee, and he has succeeded in doing so. The club has attracted a wide range of people, from students and professionals to families and tourists, and it has become one of the most popular jazz venues in the UK.  The club features a wide range of jazz artists, including saxophonists such as Simon Cottle, Terence Blanchard, Courtney Pine, and Hugh Masekela; trumpeters such as Nicholas Payton, Marcus Miller, and Niels-Henning Ã˜rsted Pedersen; trombonists such as Don Byron, Jimmy Woode, and Adam Nussbaum; pianists such as Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, and Keith Jarrett; and drummers such as Tony Williams, Tony Williams Jr., and Billy Hart. The club also features guest artists who perform live jazz music every night.

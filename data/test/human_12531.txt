Sir Robert Dillon (c. 1540 â€“ 1597) was a lawyer, judge and politician in the 16th-century Kingdom of Ireland. He came from  a family with a  distinguished record of judicial service, but his own career was dogged by accusations of serious wrongdoing, of which the most serious was that he had falsely condemned another judge to death. Birth and origins Robert was born about 1540, probably at Newtown in County Meath. He was the son of Thomas Dillon and his wife, Anne Luttrell. His father was  the only son of Sir Bartholomew Dillon, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. His mother, whom he  was  accused  many years later of ill-treating, was a daughter of Sir Thomas Luttrell, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas. He must be distinguished from his great-uncle Sir Robert Dillon (died 1580), although the confusion is natural since the  two men held the same   judicial office, and the records of the  King's Inns do not always distinguish clearly between them.

Dr. Théodore Maunoir (1 June 1806 – 2 November 1875) was a French painter.  Maunoir was born in Paris on 1 June 1806. From 1822 to 1830 he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts under François-Édouard Picot and Alexandre Cabanel. He exhibited for the first time at the Salon in 1830, and from then until his death he contributed regularly to the exhibitions of the National Gallery, where his pictures are now chiefly to be found.  Maunoir's pictures are distinguished by a vigorous realism, and his treatment of landscape, figure and costume is often clever and effective. His colour is sober but effective, and his pictures are generally well executed. Among his best works are "The Shepherds of Arcadia" (1847), "The Idleness of Saint Giles" (1848), "The Flight into Egypt" (1848), "The Return from Egypt" (1849), "The Baptism of Christ" (1850), "The Adoration of the Magi" (1851), and "The Entry into Jerusalem" (1853).  Maunoir died in Paris on 2 November 1875.

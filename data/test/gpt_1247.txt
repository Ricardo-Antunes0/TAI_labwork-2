King is the title given to a male ruler of a kingdom or country. The feminine equivalent is Queen. The title can be used by absolute monarchs or constitutional monarchs.  The title of king is usually granted to a person who is considered the legitimate ruler of a kingdom or country, as in the case of a hereditary monarchy. Alternatively, the king may be chosen by a popular vote. In some cases, the king may also be the head of state of a republic or democratic nation.

Aulus Allienus was the name of two Roman governors of Syria: one in the late 1st century AD, and another in the early 2nd century AD.  Allienus was probably a praetor or proconsul, as he is mentioned in an inscription from Emesa, Syria, which reads "Aelius Allienus proconsul suffectus". It is possible that he was also the father of Aulus Allienus Caecus.  The first Aulus Allienus governed Syria between 138 and 139. He was replaced by his son Aulus Allienus Caecus in 139, who was later replaced by Decius Mus.

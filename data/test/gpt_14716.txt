The Ringbahn (German for circle railway) is a rail line in Berlin, Germany. It connects the central railway station of Berlin with the suburban railway stations of Spandau, Reinickendorf, KÃ¶penick, and Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. It is operated by Deutsche Bahn.  The Ringbahn was built in 1882 as part of the Berlin S-Bahn network and was one of the first electrified railways in Germany. It played an important role in the development of Berlin and was the backbone of the city's public transport system until it was replaced by the U-Bahn in the 1950s. In 1981, it became part of the newly created Deutsche Bahn Regionalbahn Berlin Brandenburg (DB RB). The Ringbahn has been extensively renovated since then and today is a popular tourist attraction.

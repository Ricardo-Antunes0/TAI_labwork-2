The New Caledonian stingaree (Urolophus neocaledoniensis) is a little-known species of stingray in the family Urolophidae, found off New Caledonia and the adjacent Chesterfield Islands and Norfolk Ridge. This species reaches  long and has a rounded, diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc slightly wider than long. There is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin between its nostrils. Its tail is fairly long, lacks a dorsal fin, and ends in a leaf-shaped caudal fin; some individuals also bear slight lateral skin folds on the tail. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the New Caledonian stingaree under Least Concern, as it faces no substantial fishery threats. Taxonomy Named for the center of its distribution, the New Caledonian stingaree was described by Bernard SÃ©ret and Peter Last in a 2003 issue of the scientific journal Cybium. The first specimens were caught during research cruises undertaken in the Coral Sea by France and Australia in the 1990s; a  long male, collected from the Chesterfield Islands by the research vessel Coriolis, was designated as the holotype. This species is closely related to the Chesterfield Island stingaree (U. deforgesi), and also bears morphological similarities to the mitotic stingaree (U. mitosis).

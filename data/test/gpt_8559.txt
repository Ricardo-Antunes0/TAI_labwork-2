James Charles Evers (September 11, 1922July 22, 1963) was an American civil rights leader and activist who was assassinated while working as a field secretary for the NAACP in Mississippi.  Evers was born in 1922 in the Mississippi Delta town of Yazoo City. He grew up in a poor family and was the first in his family to attend college, earning a degree from Jackson State University in 1944. After serving in the United States Army during World War II, Evers returned to Jackson and began working as a civil rights organizer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He was elected president of the local NAACP branch in 1951 and served in that position until he was assassinated while on a field trip to Jackson, Mississippi, in 1963.  Evers is widely considered one of the most influential figures in the history of American civil rights. As president of the local NAACP branch, he helped to organize protests and sit-ins against segregation and discrimination, and he also served as a field secretary for the NAACP. In 1962, Evers became the first African American to be elected as a statewide official in Mississippi when he was elected as secretary-treasurer of the state branch of the NAACP. He is also remembered for his role in organizing Freedom Summer, an effort by African American students to register black voters in Mississippi during the summer of 1964.  Evers was assassinated while on a field trip to Jackson, Mississippi, on July 22, 1963. He was shot several times by Byron De La Beckwith

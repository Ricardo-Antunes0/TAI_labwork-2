The Chronicon Ambrosianum  or Chronica parva of Ambrosius of Milan, written in the late 6th or early 7th century AD, is an ecclesiastical history of the Holy Roman Empire, covering the years 476â€“802. It is one of the oldest surviving sources of medieval European history.  The Chronicon covers the following topics: the origin and early history of the Holy Roman Empire; the reigns of Theodosius I, Arcadius, Honorius and Theodoric; disputes between the Eastern and Western parts of the empire; religious controversies; and relations with other kingdoms in Europe and Asia. It also contains a great deal of information on economic, social and cultural life in late antiquity.  The Chronicon was commissioned by Theodosius II and written by his court historian, Eusebius of Caesarea.

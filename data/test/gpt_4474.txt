Bottom-up proteomics is a common method to identify and study the proteins in a sample by first breaking the sample down into small pieces and then analyzing the individual proteins. This method is often more efficient than traditional methods, such as western blotting, because it does not require first purifying the sample. Bottom-up proteomics has been used to study a variety of biological samples, including cancer cells, tissue samples, and blood samples.

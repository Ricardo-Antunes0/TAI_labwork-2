The Hot Space Tour was a concert tour by British singer-songwriter Elton John in support of his album "Made in England" (1973). The tour began on 15 May 1973 in Melbourne, Australia and ended on 8 November 1973 in Tokyo, Japan. The tour was notable for its elaborate stage design and costumes.  The Hot Space Tour was one of the first major tours by a solo artist to use a video backdrop, which Elton John would use extensively on later tours. In an interview with "Billboard" magazine, he said: "I just found out about it - I thought it was great. It's very visual. It's like you're there."

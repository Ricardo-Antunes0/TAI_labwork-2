The Ryerson Index is an on-line index of Canadian academic journals.  The Ryerson Index was created in 1997 by the Ryerson Library in Toronto, Ontario. It is now maintained by the CSA/Libraries Group of the Canadian Association for Research Libraries. The Ryerson Index covers journals in all subject areas, and is freely available to users on the CSA/Libraries Group web site.  The Ryerson Index is divided into two main sections: the Core Collection and the Special Collection. The Core Collection includes journals from all subject areas that are considered "core" journals for Canadian academic libraries. The Special Collection includes journals that are of particular interest to Canadian researchers, and are not generally found in other indices.  The Ryerson Index is intended as a tool for finding information about Canadian academic journals. It provides detailed information about each journal, including the publication date, title, publisher, and abstracts of selected articles. The Ryerson Index is also searchable by author, title, or keyword.

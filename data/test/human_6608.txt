Yao Yi (姚顗) (866-November 8, 940), courtesy name Bozhen (伯真) (per the Old History of the Five Dynasties) or Baizhen (百真) (per the New History of the Five Dynasties), was an official of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period states Later Liang, Later Tang, and Later Jin, serving as a chancellor during the reign of Later Tang's final emperor Li Congke. Background  Yao Yi was born in 866, during the reign of Emperor Yizong of Tang.  He was from the Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an.  His great-grandfather Yao Xiqi  served as an advisor to a prefectural prefect; his grandfather Yao Hongqing  served as a prefectural prefect; and his father Yao Jing  served as a principal of the imperial university.  Yao Yi himself was described as unintelligent, but magnanimous, in his youth.  He did not pay attention to his appearance.  As a result, people did not respect him, except for the hermit Sikong Tu , who had previously served an official in the imperial administration, and Sikong gave a daughter to him in marriage.  It was said that Yao was kind and trusting, such that his household servants and concubines were easily able to cheat him of money.  While he would realize this, he did not rebuke them in person.  He also was a poor handler of money, not understanding its value well, so he did not accumulate any wealth.

SMS Kaiser was a 92-gun wooden ship of the line of the Imperial German Navy, launched in 1858. She was renamed SMS Dresden in 1870 and served as a training ship until she was broken up in 1885.  The SMS Kaiser was one of the most powerful ships of her era and, with a displacement of almost 10,000 tons, was one of the largest wooden ships ever built. She was also one of the fastest ships in the navy, reaching a speed of over 26 knots on occasion.   Although she saw service in a range of different theatres during her long career, Kaiser mainly participated in the suppression of the Austro-Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and the Second Schleswig War against Denmark. In later years she served as a training ship for new recruits to the Imperial German Navy.   Kaiser was broken up in 1885.

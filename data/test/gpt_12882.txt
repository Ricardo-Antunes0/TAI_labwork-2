Krasnogorodsk  is an urban locality (a work settlement) and the administrative center of Krasnogorodsky District in the Rostov Oblast, Russia, located on the left bank of the Don River just above its confluence with the Volga. Population:   Krasnogorodsk was founded in 1598 as a fortification on the left bank of the Don River by Vasilii III of Russia to guard against raids by the Crimean Khanate. It became an important trade center and was granted town status in 1702. In 1812, during the Napoleonic Wars, it was captured by French forces and briefly served as the capital of their puppet administration in Russia. After Russian forces recaptured it, the town prospered as a textile center due to its proximity to the cotton-growing areas of Ukraine and Kazakhstan. However, during Stalin's purges in the 1930s, many of its prosperous citizens were killed or exiled, and Krasnogorodsk fell into decline. It was revived as a tourist destination during the late 1980s, and has since regained some of its former prominence as a trade center.

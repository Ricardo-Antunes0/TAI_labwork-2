Î½ Pavonis, Latinized as Nu Pavonis, is a white-hued binary star in the constellation Pavo. The primary, a giant star of magnitude 3.5, is about 114 AUs from Earth and the secondary, a small, faint star, is about 4.5 AUs from the primary. The two stars are gravitationally bound and form an eclipsing binary system, with the secondary eclipsing the primary every 1.5 days.  Nu Pavonis is one of the most luminous stars in the night sky and can be seen with the naked eye in good conditions. It was included as one of the 48 Messier objects by Charles Messier in 1781. The name Pavonis is Latin for peacock and refers to the bird's plumage which is predominantly blue, green and purple.

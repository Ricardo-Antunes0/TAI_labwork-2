Brazilian Day is an annual festival which takes place in New York City (NYC) and other cities around the world (v.g., Philadelphia). It is held near the beginning of September to celebrate Brazil's independence day celebrated today in the Federative Republic of Brazil on September 7, 1822 -  proclaimed by prince regent - heir to the Portuguese  throne Dom Pedro I (1798-1834), from the previous United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves (and his father King Joao VI / John VI, 1767â€“1826), establishing the new Empire of Brazil (1822-1889) in South America. Brazilian Day is always on Sunday before the American Labor Day holiday weekend.  Brazilian Day is part of the official calendar of New York City. The event first ran in 1984, and was on West 46th Street between 5th Avenue and Avenue of the Americas (6th Avenue), which later received the name "Little Brazil". From 2009 on, Brazilian Day also has taken place in the United States (San Francisco), Canada (Montreal, Toronto), Japan (Tokyo), United Kingdom (London) and Angola (Luanda).

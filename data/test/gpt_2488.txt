The Soviet Census held on January 6, 1937 was the first census of the Soviet Union. It was conducted in accordance with the 1936 Soviet Constitution, which mandated that a census be held every five years. The census counted a population of 127,692,000 people, making it the largest in Soviet history.  The census was an important tool for the Soviet government to collect information about the population and to assess the country's growth and development. The data collected by the census helped to determine how much money to allocate to various sectors of the economy, and it was also used to determine who was eligible for social benefits and access to education and healthcare.

Sago Lane  is a one-way lane in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The lane is located in the Lower Whitechapel district and runs between Whitechapel High Street and Brick Lane.  In the 16th century, Sago Lane was known as "The Ropewalk". It was a major thoroughfare for the merchants and artisans who lived in the nearby jerry-built houses. The lane was notorious for its crime and prostitution, and by the early 19th century it had become a slum. In 1887, the Metropolitan Board of Works began to clear the lanes of their houses and to develop them into public gardens. The lane was renamed Sago Street in honour of the sago palm, which was once abundant in the area.  Despite its unsavoury reputation, Sago Lane is now one of London's most popular shopping streets. It is home to some of the city's most famous independent retailers, including Paul Smith, White Stuff, Missoni and Burberry. The lane also contains a number of small museums, including the Museum of Childhood and the Museum of London Docklands.

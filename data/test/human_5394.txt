Getty Herschel Huffine (August 25, 1889 â€“ February 12, 1947) was an American music composer, trombonist and tuba player. He was born in Bowling Green, Kentucky, on August 25, 1889, the eldest of four children. He was employed at an axe handle factory and, when the Bowling Green town band was organized in 1907, he was accepted on the condition that he play valve trombone, a trombone with a fixed slide and valves such as a euphonium. He was a self-taught musician. During the next five years Huffine taught himself tuba as well as the basics of harmony, counterpoint and composition. It is reputed that he spent his mature years as a tubist in professional bands (including Patrick Conway's Band) and possibly circus bands. It is reputed that he worked for C. L. Barnhouse as a music engraver, however there are no substantiating records. In 1919, Huffine settled in Binghamton, New York, playing tuba in the Endicott-Johnson Shoe Factory band, as well as filling in on trumpet, trombone, and string bass (based on information from Endicott-Johnson Co).

"Senza una donna"  is a song written and performed by Zucchero from his fourth album, Blue's (1987). Originally recorded in Italian, in 1990 it was re-recorded in English with Paul Young. The English lyrics were contributed by Frank Musker. The song was then released as a single under the title "Senza una donna (Without a Woman)" which reached #4 in the UK Single Chart and #2 in the German Singles Chart and the French Singles Chart. It also topped the charts of Norway, Iceland, Quebec, Belgium and Sweden. It has sold more than 5,000,000 copies worldwide. It was released along with a music video for the solo version by Zucchero and a music video was also released for the duet version with Paul Young. It is one of the three italian songs that has topped the European Singles top 100. It was one of the most famous songs in Venezuela in 1991. Critical reception Larry Flick from Billboard commented, "Italo pop star has outsold Madonna and Michael Jackson in his homeland. On this duet with Young, Zucchero makes his U.S. debut with a smooth and rhythmic ballad that will likely find its initial audience at AC radio, though tune is charming enough to cross into mainstream pop territory." A reviewer from Liverpool Echo described the song as "stylish", noting the "marvellously atmospheric setting" of the music video, "which was actually filmed in a church hall in Chiswick."

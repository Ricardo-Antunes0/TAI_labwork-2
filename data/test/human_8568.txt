Sir Coutts Lindsay, 2nd Baronet (2 February 1824 â€“ 7 May 1913 Kingston upon Thames), was a British artist and watercolourist. Life Lindsay was the eldest son of Lieutenant-General Sir James Lindsay, son of the Hon. Robert Lindsay, second son of James Lindsay, 5th Earl of Balcarres. His mother was Anne, daughter of Sir Coutts Trotter, 1st Baronet, a principal partner in Coutt's Bank. Robert Loyd-Lindsay, 1st Baron Wantage, was his younger brother. In 1839 he succeeded by special remainder to his maternal grandfather's baronetcy (which became extinct on Lindsay's own death). He then entered the army, commanding the 1st Regiment of the Italian Legion during the Crimean War before retiring from military life to devote himself to art. From 1862 to 1874 he exhibited many pictures, including various successful portraits. In 1879 he and his first wife, Lady Lindsay (of Balcarres), were both elected to membership of the Institute of Painters in Water Colours. His studio at 4-5 Cromwell Place was also used by Archibald Stuart-Wortley.

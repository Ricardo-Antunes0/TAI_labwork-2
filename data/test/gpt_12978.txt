The Akazu (, little house) was an important form of Japanese architecture from the Heian period to the Kamakura period. The name is derived from the verb akaza (to build, to erect), and is a term for a type of small, one-story building typically used as a residence or shop.  The Akazu was most commonly constructed of wooden boards covered with leather or paper, with a thatched roof. They were often situated in rural areas near rivers or streams, where they served as storage, workshop, or home. The buildings were typically small, measuring no more than 12 feet by 12 feet.

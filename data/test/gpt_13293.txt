The Campaign for Democracy (CD)  is an American non-profit organization founded in 2002 by former U.S. Representative from New York Charles B. Rangel and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate José Ramos-Horta. The organization's mission is to build a global movement to defend democracy and promote human rights.  The Campaign for Democracy has worked to support democracy movements around the world, from the pro-democracy movement in Ukraine to the mounting opposition to the Venezuelan government of Nicolás Maduro. In the United States, the organization has been involved in efforts to reform campaign finance laws, promote voting rights, and advocate for greater access to education and health care.  Today, the Campaign for Democracy is a coalition of more than 150 organizations from around the world. Our members include human rights defenders, political parties, trade unions, and grassroots groups from more than 30 countries. We work together to build a global movement of people who are committed to defending democracy and promoting human rights.

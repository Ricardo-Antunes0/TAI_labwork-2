Reflex is a BBC television game show hosted by Shane Richie and aired from 11 January to 29 March 2014 on BBC One. Overview Each episode consists of two families of three competing over a number of challenges in order to win their place in the final round to be in with a chance to win up to Â£20,000. Although most of the games are completed within mere seconds from the starting trigger, viewers watch them almost exclusively in slow motion. The real-time attempts are shown mostly as replays after the heat has finished, which is the reverse of the typical game show practices. All games require from contestants excellent hand-eye coordination, composure and, above all, the titular reflex. The show makes extensive use of both 2D and 3D computer-generated imagery, using for example 3D motion tracking to attach statistics graphics to contestants, or 3D wireframe animations to present the rules of a game.

Pullet Surprise is a 1997 7-minute Looney Tunes short released in theaters with Cats Don't Dance. It was produced by Chuck Jones Film Productions. Since this cartoon was produced after the death of legendary Looney Tunes voice artist Mel Blanc, the voice of Foghorn Leghorn is supplied by Frank Gorshin, while Stan Freberg reprises his role as Pete Puma from the 1952 short, Rabbit's Kin. The term "pullet" in the title refers to a young female chicken, while the title is a pun on "Pulitzer Prize". The short was not included in the DVD release of Cats Don't Dance, though it was included as a bonus feature on the DVD release of The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie. Plot In the cartoon, Pete Puma is trying to raid the henhouse Foghorn Leghorn is guarding; Foghorn decides to have some fun with Pete. He tells Pete what he really wants is a Venezuelan Racing Chicken which has unfortunately run back to Venezuela. Pete runs there and back in time. Next, he really wants an Irish Wrestling Chicken, which turns out to be a rope tied to a bull's tail (this bull resembles Toro from Bully for Bugs). When Pete makes off with a chicken, nest and all, Foghorn grabs the chicken, then says Pete's found the rare Mongolian Disappearing Chicken, and the only way to make it reappear is tap dancing; Pete dances into a hole; Foggy drops an anvil on Pete's head ("a whole lotta lumps!"). Foggy walks away, chuckling at his cleverness, when a genuine Irish Wrestling Chicken pins him down ("I'm glad I say I'm glad I didn't show him the Norwegian Exploding Chicken").

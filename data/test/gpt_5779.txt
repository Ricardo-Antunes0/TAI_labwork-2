Change Colours is the third studio album by the Scottish rock band Idlewild. It was released on 8 October 2004, through Polydor Records.  The album was preceded by the single "Keep on Running" in 2003. The album reached number nine on the UK Albums Chart and spawned four singles: "Change Colours", "In a Minute", "What's Left of Me" and "Running to Stand Still".  The album has been described as a return to Idlewild's heavier roots, with songs that are more reminiscent of their first two albums.  "Change Colours" was recorded at Mango Studios in Glasgow, with producer Tony Visconti. The band enlisted Visconti to help them recapture the sound of their early albums, with tracks such as "In a Minute" and "What's Left of Me" being described as reminiscent of the band's debut album, "Idlewild".

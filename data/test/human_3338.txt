Corzetti or Croxetti ( or ) are a kind of pasta typical of the Ligurian cuisine of north-west Italy, and traditional also in the area of Novi Ligure just across the border with Piedmont in the Province of Alessandria. Corzetti originated in Liguria, in Northern Italy along the border with France, during the middle ages. The name itself derives from a 14th century Genoan coin, the corzetto. There are different kinds of corzetti. Those from the Val Polcevera, one of the principal valleys of the area of Genoa are made in "figure of eight" shape. Elsewhere  corzetti stamp√¶ (, "pressed" or "stamped" corzetti) are found. These are small, thin rounds of pasta that are given an embossed decoration using a special wooden hand-tool. The embossing helps the pasta to hold its sauce better. A pasta with a similar name can also be found in neighbouring Piedmont, but its shape is more akin to that of orecchiette.

Sulfoaildenafil (thioaildenafil) is a synthetic chemical compound that is a potent and selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-5, an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the cell. This leads to increased cGMP levels, which in turn leads to increased smooth muscle relaxation, increased blood flow, and enhanced erectile function.  Sulfoaildenafil was first discovered in the early 1990s and was initially used as a potential treatment for high blood pressure. However, it was later found to be effective as an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-5 in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Sulfoaildenafil is currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men aged 18 years and older. It is also approved in several other countries for this purpose.

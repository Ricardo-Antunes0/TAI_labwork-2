He lived as a child in the Middle East, where his father was stationed, but returned to England to study at Bryanston School. He then read History at Magdalen College, Oxford. After completing his degree, he started working for an advertising agency in 1955, before writing two comic novels, A High-Pitched Buzz (1956) and Switchboard (1957), based on his experiences there.

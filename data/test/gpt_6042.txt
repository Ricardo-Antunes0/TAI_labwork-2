The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) is the largest and most comprehensive database of known or suspected terrorists in the world. It is maintained by the United States government's National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC).  The TSDB contains biographical and terrorist information on individuals who have been identified as terrorists, or who may pose a terrorist threat. The database includes information on individuals who have been convicted of terrorism-related offences, those under investigation for terrorism-related offences, and those suspected of being terrorists but who have not been convicted or even formally investigated. The TSDB also contains information on terrorist groups and networks, as well as on terrorist propaganda and financing.  The TSDB is used by law enforcement and intelligence agencies to screen individuals for terrorist links, to identify potential threats to national security, and to track the movements of known or suspected terrorists. The TSDB is also used to support the development of counterterrorism policies.

In Armenian Christian tradition, matagh ( mataÄ¡) is a cross with four arms in the shape of an X. The matagh is traditionally erected on the graves of martyrs and saints, as well as on churches and other holy places.  The matagh is an ancient Armenian Christian symbol that has its roots in paganism. The first recorded mention of the matagh comes from the 5th century AD, when it was depicted on a mosaic at the Church of St. Gregory the Illuminator in Taron. The matagh subsequently became a popular symbol among Armenians due to its spiritual significance. Today, the matagh is used by various Christian denominations to represent their beliefs and traditions.

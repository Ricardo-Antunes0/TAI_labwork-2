Clinical trials are experiments or observations done on people with the goal of finding out if a new treatment is effective.  Clinical trials are important because they help to find new treatments for diseases. Clinical trials are also used to test new drugs and treatments before they are made available to the public. Clinical trials can be done in many different ways, but the most common way is to give people a new treatment and see if it is effective.

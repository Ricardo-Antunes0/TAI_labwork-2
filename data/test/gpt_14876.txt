The Purple Heart (PH) is a United States military decoration awarded to members of the United States Armed Forces who are wounded or killed while performing duty. The Purple Heart is the only U.S. military decoration that is not a rank.  The Purple Heart was originally established by George Washington as an award for valor in the face of the enemy. The current design of the Purple Heart was made by Congress in 1932. The medal is a circular medallion made of bronze, silver or gold and is 1 7/8 inches in diameter. On the front of the medal is a representation of an eagle holding an olive branch in its talons. Inscriptions on the back of the medal read "For Distinguished Gallantry" and "In Memory Of Those Who Died For Their Country."

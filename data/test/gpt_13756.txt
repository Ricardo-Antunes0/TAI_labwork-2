Carlos Montezuma or Wassaja (c. 1866 – c. 1918) was a Mexican general and president of Mexico in the early 20th century. He was also the last king of Mexico. As president, he oversaw a period of instability and economic decline in Mexico.  Born in 1866, Montezuma grew up in the small town of Tlaxcala. He fought for the revolutionary forces in the Mexican Revolution and became a general in 1917. After the victory of the Revolution, he was elected president in 1920 and served until his death in 1918. During his presidency, Mexico faced major economic challenges. These included a sharp decline in agricultural production, a rise in unemployment and inflation, and conflict with United States authorities over trade policies. Despite these challenges, Montezuma is generally considered to have been a competent president. He died shortly after leaving office and was succeeded by his vice-president, Plutarco Elías Calles.

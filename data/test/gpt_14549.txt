Charles "Teenie" Harris (July 2, 1908â€“June 12, 1988) was an American photographer and film-maker. He is best known for his black-and-white images of the American West, which he captured during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s.  Born in Muskogee, Oklahoma, Harris began his photographic career as a teenager in the 1920s. He moved to California in the early 1930s and began working as a freelance photographer for national magazines. In the early 1940s, he began working for Farm Security Administration (FSA) photographers documenting wartime conditions in the American West. He continued to work for the FSA until 1951.  After leaving the FSA, Harris became a full-time photographer and made his first documentary film, "The West of Charles Harris", in 1953. He continued to make documentary films until his death in 1988. His photographs have been exhibited at museums around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

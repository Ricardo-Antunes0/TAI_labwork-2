The Mercury Islands are a group of seven islands off the northeast coast of New Zealand's North Island. They are located  off the coast of the Coromandel Peninsula, and  northeast of the town of Whitianga. Description The main chain of the Mercury Islands consists of the large Great Mercury Island (also known as ) to the west, Red Mercury Island  to the east, and five much smaller islands between the two (Korapuki, Green, Atiu/Middle, Kawhitu/Stanley and Moturehu/Double Islands). All the islands, except Ahuahu/Great Mercury Island, have statutory protection and are managed by the Department of Conservation as highly valuable Nature Reserves where public access prohibited. Ahuahu/Great Mercury Island is privately owned and public access is allowed (excluding residential sites and the planted pine forest). One lone island, Repanga/Cuvier Island, also a protected Nature Reserve, lies  to the north of Ahuahu/Great Mercury Island, although this island is not normally considered part of the Mercury Island group.

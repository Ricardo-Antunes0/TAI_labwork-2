Lawrence Sulak is an American physicist, currently the George W. Hewlett Professor of Physics at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. He was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics, "for his discoveries of the principles of laser cooling and the laser-induced breakdown of water into hydrogen and oxygen".  Born in Chicago, Illinois, Sulak is a graduate of Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. After postdoctoral studies at the University of California, Berkeley, he joined the University of Rochester faculty in 1984. Sulak's work has focused on the physics of lasers and their applications in optical engineering. He is known for his work on the theory of laser cooling and on the breakdown of water into hydrogen and oxygen under laser irradiation.

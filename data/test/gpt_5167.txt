The Kessinians, also known as Kessini, Chizzini, and Cizzini, are a people who inhabit the Kessin district in the north-western corner of Anatolia, Turkey.  The Kessinians are originally from the same ethnic and linguistic background as the neighbouring Kurds. However, they have been isolated from the Kurds for centuries, and maintain their own distinct culture and language.  The Kessinians are mainly agriculturalists, growing wheat, barley, and peas. They also produce livestock, including sheep, goats, and cows. The Kessinians are traditional weavers and make traditional clothing such as kilims and tunics.  The Kessinians have a small number of schools, but there is a growing demand for education among the population. The Kessinians have their own parliament and president.

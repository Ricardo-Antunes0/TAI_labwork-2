Built to house the offices and computer center of the Occidental Life Insurance Company, it was completed in 1965. It is the 32nd-tallest building in Los Angeles, and was the second-tallest (after the Los Angeles City Hall) when it was completed. The International styled building was designed by William Pereira & Associates.

In the 1960s there was a restaurant at the top of the building—The Tower—that served award-winning French cuisine. It originally included two other large buildings - a  building at 1149 Hill Street, a  building at 514 W 12th Street (which was later sold to the city as the Public Works Building). It also included three parking decks with 3,500 spots, and a  plot on the corner of Eleventh and Olive Streets. The three buildings are connected by underground pedestrian tunnels.

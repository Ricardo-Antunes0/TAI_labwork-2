The English Defence League (EDL) is a far-right, Islamophobic organisation in the United Kingdom. It is headquartered in Luton, Bedfordshire, and was founded in London in October 2009.  The EDL is a self-styled civil defence organisation which professes to protect British citizens from what it regards as the threats of Islam and immigration. The group has been linked to various incidents of far-right violence and vandalism, including the firebombing of a mosque in Dewsbury, Yorkshire, in 2013.  The EDL is opposed to all forms of Islam and has been criticised for its anti-immigrant rhetoric and for its links to Neo-Nazi groups. In January 2017, the EDL was banned from marching through a mainly Muslim area of London after protests from community leaders.

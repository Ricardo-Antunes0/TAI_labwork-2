File eXchange Protocol (FXP or FXSP) is a network protocol used for exchanging files between computers. It is a simple text-based protocol, and its design goals include universality, reliability, and low latency.  FXP was created as an alternative to the more popular HTTP and FTP protocols, and it became an Internet standard in 1999. FXP is commonly used to transfer files between systems in a LAN environment, but it can also be used to transfer files between systems on the Internet.

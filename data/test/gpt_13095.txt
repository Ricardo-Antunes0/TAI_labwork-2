William Swymmer (birth and death dates unknown) was a nineteenth-century American minister and abolitionist.  Swymmer was born in Maryland and educated at the University of Baltimore. After ministering in the United States, he moved to England in 1851, where he became a prominent figure in the anti-slavery movement. He helped to found the London Abolition Society, and served as its president from 1858 until his death.  Swymmer was also a writer and lecturer. His most notable work is The Moral Condition of Man (1857), a defense of slavery based on Christian principles.

Solar-like oscillations are oscillations in distant stars that resemble the oscillations seen in the Sun. These oscillations are caused by the gravitational pull of a companion star, and can last for periods of up to tens of days. They are thought to play an important role in the dynamics of stars, and may be responsible for the Sun's activity cycle.  Solar-like oscillations were first observed in stars that are much farther away than the Sun, and were later found to occur in both main-sequence and supergiant stars.

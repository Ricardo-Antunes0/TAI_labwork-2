Aberbechan Hall was a timber framed mansion in the township of Aberbechan within the parish of Llanllwchaearn in the historic county of Montgomeryshire. The township of Aberbechan was transferred to Bettws Cedewain and more recently moved, with the township of Dolforwyn, into the community of Abermule with Llandyssil. The Hall was originally built by the Blayney family, passing to the Price and Lloyd families, before becoming the property of Sir Gervais Clifton. In 1810 it was sold to David Pugh of Llanerchydol near Welshpool. The Hall was demolished in 1870 and replaced by the present Hall. History of the Hall This was a house that had been built by the senior branch of the Blayney family, but  Rhys ap Morris (Blayney) became High Sheriff of Montgomeryshire in 1565, the family name changed to  Price (ap Rhys). The house descended to Sir John Price, who swapped sides in the Civil War and became the Parliamentary Commander of Montgomery Castle. The Hall then  passed to his son Sir Richard Price. The house passed to the Lloyd family, but in 1766, the heiress Frances Lloyd married Sir Gervais Clifton. This was probably a case of an  Englishmen prowling for Welsh heiresses. Sir Gervais Clifton 6th.Baronet was a leading Nottinghamshire landowner and is likely to have been an absentee landlord. The house and its estates were later sold in 1810 to David Pugh, a fabulously wealthy London Tea dealer, who was to build the castellated, gothic revival house at Llanerchydol Hall, on the outskirts of Welshpool.

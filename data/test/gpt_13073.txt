Rose Hill Farmstead, also known as the John Mason House, is a historic home located at Eatonville in Allegany County, New York. It was built about 1851 and is a two-story, five bay, Federal style frame dwelling on a fieldstone foundation. The front facade has a two-story, gable roofed portico supported by four fluted Ionic order columns. The house has a rear ell addition and several outbuildings.  John Mason, an early settler of Eatonville, was the original owner of Rose Hill Farmstead. He was a miller and farmer who also served as postmaster and justice of the peace. Mason's son, George W. Mason, was also a prominent resident of Eatonville and served as mayor of the city in 1892. Rose Hill Farmstead remained in the Mason family until 1937 when it was sold to the Eatonville Historical Society. It is currently used as a museum and research center.

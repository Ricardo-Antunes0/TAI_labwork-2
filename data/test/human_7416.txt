It is sometimes identified as a place named Golgam at latitude 18° N longitude 78° E. The name Golagrama considered as a word in Sanskrit could literally be translated as sphere-village. Golagrama school of astronomy Several medieval Indian astronomers and mathematicians are known to have flourished in Golagrama. They were all members of one large extended family. The astronomical and mathematical knowledge of the members of this family was passed from generation to generation through teacher-pupil relationships. In nearly all the cases, the teacher would be an elder member of the family like father being a teacher of his son, elder brother being teacher of a younger brother. The members of this family were also referred to as Daivajnas. One of the most distinguished mathematician of this family was Kamalakara. Kamalakara was born in Benares about 1616   after some members of the family migrated to Benares.

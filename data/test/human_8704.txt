In digital electronics, a level shifter, also called  logic-level shifter or voltage level translator, is a circuit used to translate signals from one logic level or voltage domain to another, allowing compatibility between integrated circuits with different voltage requirements, such as TTL and CMOS.  Modern systems use level shifters to bridge domains between processors, logic, sensors, and other circuits.  In recent years, the three most common logic levels have been 1.8V, 3.3V, and 5V, though levels above and below these voltages are also used. Types of level shifter Uni-directional – All input pins are dedicated to one voltage domain, all output pins are dedicated to the other.   Bi-directional with Dedicated ports – Each voltage domain has both input and output pins, but the data direction of a pin does not change.   Bi-directional with external direction indicator – When an external signal is changed, inputs become outputs and vice versa.   Bi-directional, auto-sensing – A pair of I/O spanning voltage domains can act as either inputs or outputs depending on external stimulus without the need for a dedicated direction control pin.

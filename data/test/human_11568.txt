Velino Shije Herrera (October 22, 1902 â€“ January 1973), also known as Ma Pe Wi, was a Zia Pueblo Indian painter. Biography  Born in Zia Pueblo, New Mexico, Herrera attended the Santa Fe Indian School. The Bureau of Indian Affairs prohibited arts training, but the wife of the superintendent of the school, Elizabeth Willis DeHuff, invited Herrera and his fellow students Fred Kabotie, Otis Polelonema, and Awa Tsireh to paint in her living room. DeHuff's painting groups have been described as a seminal event in the development of the Southwest Movement of Native American painting. The work of DeHuff's students were displayed at the Museum of New Mexico in 1919 and museum director Edgar Lee Hewett hired Herrera and other artists for various jobs at the museum and for the School of American Research. Herrera said, "Dr. Hewett selected a few he thought had talent and started us to painting. I was one. I have been painting ever since."

Radio Bergeijk is a Dutch satirical radio programme of which Peer van Eersel and Toon Spoorenberg are the anchormen. They are played by the comedians George van Houts and Pieter Bouwman respectively. The first episode was broadcast on April 3, 2001 from 00:44 AM to 01:00 AM. From then on, a new episode could be heard every weekday. In January 2004 there were dramatic changes in the Dutch radio programming and Radio Bergeijk was forced to broadcast just every Saturday from 13:30 to 14:00 on Radio 1. Subjects of the programme Radio Bergeijk handles controversial subjects arising in Dutch society. Examples of the most popular subjects of the programme are the national immigration policy, health care, the elderly, the society which seems to get less and less tolerant and World War II. One could see the town of Bergeijk as a small country: everything which happens in the world also seems to happen in Bergeijk. Radio Bergeijk has elements of black humour, such as extremely unfair behaviour of the anchormen, foul language, violence and the abuse of minority groups. For instance, guests with a charitable initiative often get abused by the anchormen during an interview which often results in a fight. A second example is that the town of Bergeijk always seems to be in conflict with neighbouring towns, which sometimes results in a true battle.

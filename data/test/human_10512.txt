The GEOSAT (GEOdetic SATellite) was a U.S. Navy Earth observation satellite, launched on March 12, 1985 into an 800 km, 108° inclination orbit, with a nodal period of about 6040 seconds. The satellite carried a radar altimeter capable of measuring the distance from the satellite to sea surface with a relative precision of about 5 cm. The initial phase was an 18-month classified Geodetic Mission (GM) have a ground-track with a near-23-day repeat with closure to within 50 kilometers. The effect of atmospheric drag was such that by fall 1986 GEOSAT was in an almost exact 23-day repeat orbit. Mission The Geosat GM goal was to provide information on the marine gravity field.  If the ocean surface were at rest, and no forces such as tides or winds were acting on it, the water surface would lie along the geoid.  To first order, the Earth shape is an oblate spheroid.  Subsurface features such as seamounts create a gravitational pull, and features such as ocean trenches create lower gravity areas.  Spatial variations in gravity exert influence on the ocean surface and thereby cause spatial structure in the geoid.  The deviations of the geoid from the first order spheroid are on the order of ± 100m.  By measuring the position of the water surface above the Earth center, the geoid is observed, and the gravity field can be computed through inverse calculations.

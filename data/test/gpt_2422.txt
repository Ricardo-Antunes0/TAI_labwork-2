Judith Balcazar (born 1953) is an Australian-British artist who lives and works in London. She has exhibited widely since the early 1980s, including at the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Tate Gallery, London; and the Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris.  Balcazar's art is focused on investigating the relationship between painting and sculpture. She often creates installations that use both traditional and non-traditional media, such as felt, fabric, video, and light. Her work has been compared to that of Andy Warhol and Cy Twombly.

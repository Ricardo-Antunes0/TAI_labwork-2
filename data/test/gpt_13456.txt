A teleprinter (teletypewriter, teletype or TTY) is an electronic device that transmits text or characters electrically over a telecommunications network.  A teleprinter is used to send and receive typed or printed text, usually via a telephone line. Early teleprinters were mechanical devices that used human operators to move the printhead across the paper and type out the text. With the advent of computer networks, modern teleprinters are largely electronic devices that use a keyboard or other input device to send characters directly to a printer.  Teleprinters can be used for many purposes, including business, government, education, and engineering. They are also used for remote access to computers, allowing users to type out text and have it printed at the other end without having to be physically present at the computer.

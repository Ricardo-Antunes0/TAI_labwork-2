She was born in Namur, Belgium, as the daughter of Paul Malherbe and Chantal Gosselin. She met Correa while both were attending courses in the University of Louvain (UCLouvain), in Belgium. They later married and, during Correa's presidency, set up residency in Ecuador. After the end of Correa's presidency, the couple moved to Belgium. Public statements  After Correa's inauguration, Malherbe opted to keep a low public profile, remaining completely focused on her duties as a mother and wife. The only public statement of a political nature was during the first weeks of President Correa's term in office, made concerning the perceived duties of the First Lady; she alleged that "we, women are all equal" giving reassurances to all people that hold the belief of a self intrinsic value as individuals and not for their spouse's position. It is important to highlight that she received a total unyielding support from her husband in this decision.

Saint Malchus of Syria (or Malchus of Chalcis, Malchus of Maronia) (died c. 390) is the subject of Saint Jerome's biography Life of Malchus the Captive Monk (Vita Malchi monachi captivi), written in Latin around 391/392 CE. According to Jerome, Malchus was a monk who was sold into slavery and forced to marry another slave. While never consummating the marriage, he escaped with his wife and returned to his monastery. Jerome interviewed Malchus at his home in Maronia, Syria, while Malchus and his wife were still alive. Malchus is commemorated 26 March by the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, and is in the Roman Martyrology for Oct. 21. There is no record of him except for Jerome's biographical account. Life According to Jerome's account, Malchus was the only child of a farming family that resided near Nisibis during the fourth century. When he reached mature age Malchus' parents desired that he should marry.  Malchus left his family home at this time and began his monastic life in the desert of Chalcis.

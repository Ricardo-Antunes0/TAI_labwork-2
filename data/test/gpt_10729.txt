Single-use medical devices include any medical equipment, such as syringes, bandages, and needles, that are used once and then disposed of. They have been linked to health risks, such as infections, burns, and even death.  Single-use medical devices have been controversial since their inception. Critics argue that they are unsafe and lead to more health risks than benefits. Proponents of single-use medical devices argue that they are more environmentally friendly and reduce the amount of waste that is produced. There is currently no consensus on the best way to address the safety and environmental concerns raised by single-use medical devices.

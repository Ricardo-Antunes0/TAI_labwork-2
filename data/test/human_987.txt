Markéta  Vondroušová (; born 28 June 1999) is a Czech professional tennis player. She has a career-high ranking of world No. 14 by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA). Vondroušová finished runner-up at the 2019 French Open, where she became the first teenage Grand Slam finalist on the tour since Caroline Wozniacki, nearly a decade earlier. She has won one WTA singles title out of four finals and a silver medal at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. Vondroušová is a former world No. 1 junior, having won two Grand Slam doubles titles. She had a quick breakthrough on the WTA Tour, winning the 2017 Ladies Open Biel Bienne at the age of 17 in just her second career WTA singles event. This title helped her reach the top 100 of the WTA rankings before turning 18 years old. Vondroušová has struggled with injuries early in her career, most notably missing the second half of the 2019 season shorty after her French Open maiden final.

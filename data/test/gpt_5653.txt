Androcracy is a form of government in which a single ruler or executive oversees the administration of a society. The term is derived from the Greek words ἀνδρός (andros, "man") and κρατία (kratia, "rule").  Androcracies can take many different forms, but they all share a common feature: a centralized bureaucracy which manages the day-to-day affairs of the society. This bureaucracy is usually organized into departments, with each department carrying out specific tasks. As a result, Androcracies are often described as being top-down systems.  Androcracies can be good or bad things. They can be efficient and effective systems, or they can be corrupt and inefficient. They can also be democratic or autocratic. The main advantages of Androcracies are that they are easy to administer and manage, and they can be very efficient in carrying out their tasks. The main disadvantages are that they can be slow to change, and they can be prone to corruption.

Daylight Again is the seventh album by the American heavy metal band Pantera, released on September 25, 2000 through Warner Bros. Records. The album was produced by Rick Rubin and recorded at the RCA Studio B in Nashville, Tennessee with a production budget of $1 million.  The album has been met with generally positive reviews from music critics. It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling over 188,000 copies in its first week. It has since been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album has also been nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance.  "Daylight Again" is the heaviest and most aggressive album by Pantera to date, featuring a more metallic and hard-edged sound than their previous work. The lyrics on the album deal with subjects such as violence, drugs, and death.   The song "Walk" was originally intended for the soundtrack to the film "The Crow", but was rejected by the producers. The song "I'm Broken" was written about drummer Vinnie Paul Abbott's father, who died shortly before the album's release.

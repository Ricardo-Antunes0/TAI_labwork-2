The La Liga Awards, previously known as the LFP Awards, are presented annually by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional (known as the Liga de Football Profesional (LFP) to the best players and coach in La Liga, the highest division of association football in Spain. They should not be confused with other similar awards associated with sports newspaper Marca. Established in the 2008–09 season, they are the first official awards in the history of the Spanish competition. La Liga's best coach and player in each position—goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, and forward—are chosen based on a voting by the captain and vice-captains of each club, while the best player overall is determined via statistical analysis. Lionel Messi has been named La Liga's best player for nine times and La Liga's best forward for eleven times, both all-time records. Across all positions, the other outstanding individuals are Barcelona midfielder Andrés Iniesta with five wins, Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola with four wins, Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos with four wins, and goalkeepers Iker Casillas of Real Madrid and Víctor Valdés of Barcelona with three and one wins respectively.

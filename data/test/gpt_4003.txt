Andrew Law (1749â€“1821) was an American composer, organist, and teacher. Law was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, into a musical family; his father, also Andrew, was a composer and violinist. After studying with his father and Samuel Arnold, he moved to London to study composition with Joseph Haydn. He returned to America in 1777 and became the organist at Trinity Church in New York City. In 1785 he moved to Charleston, South Carolina, where he served as organist at St. Michael's Church for the rest of his life.  Law is best known for his opera The Campanella (1794), which was very well received by the public. He also wrote a number of other operas, including The Wonder-Worker (1797), The Maid of Orleans (1806), and The Siege of Corinth (1816). He also composed chamber music, including three string quartets and two piano trios. He was a prolific teacher; among his students were Charles Willson Peale and Nicholas Biddle. Law died in Charleston in 1821.

Audience segmentation is a process of dividing an audience into groups based on their interests, behavior, and demographics.  Audience segmentation is an important tool for advertisers and marketers because it allows them to target their messages to specific groups of people. It is also important for content creators because it allows them to tailor their content to specific groups of people.  There are a variety of methods that can be used to segment an audience. One method is to use demographic information, such as age, gender, and race. Another method is to use behavioral information, such as online activity or watching habits.  There are a number of factors that can be used to determine which groups should be targeted with a message. One factor is the message's content. For example, messages that are targeted at women may be different than messages that are targeted at men.   Another factor is the target audience's location. For example, messages aimed at people in the United States may be different than messages aimed at people in Canada.   Another factor is the target audience's behavior. For example, messages that are targeted at people who have made a purchase in the past may be different than messages that are targeted at people who have not made a purchase in the past.   Finally, demographic and behavioral data can be combined to create target audiences that are even more specific. For example, a message that is targeted at people who have made a purchase in the past two weeks may be different than a message that is targeted at people

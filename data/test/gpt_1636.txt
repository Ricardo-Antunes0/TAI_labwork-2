Prof.(Dr.) Ramesh Nandan Prasad Barial (; 31 July 1931 â€“ 8 December 2018) was an Indian theoretical physicist and a professorial fellow at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. He is known for his work in the fields of string theory and quantum field theory.  Ramesh Barial was born on 31 July 1931 in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India. He received his BSc from Banaras Hindu University in 1953 and his PhD from the University of Mumbai in 1958 under the supervision of Prof. S. N. Das. After a postdoctoral stint at Cornell University, he returned to Mumbai as a faculty member at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in 1968. He served as TIFR Director from 1978 to 1984 and as Pro-Vice-Chancellor from 1984 to 1988.  Barial's research focuses on the theories of string theory and quantum field theory, which are two of the most important areas of theoretical physics. In string theory, he has developed techniques for describing the mathematical properties of strings, which are tiny pieces of matter that vibrate like strings of a musical instrument. These techniques have led him to new insights into the fundamental nature of space and time. In quantum field theory, Barial is known for his work on theories of elementary particles, including the quark model and the SU(5) gauge theory. Together, these theories provide a comprehensive understanding of the forces that govern the behavior of matter on Earth.  Barial was elected a Fellow of the Royal

Raffaello "Raf" di Lucca is a fictional character from the BBC medical drama Holby City, played by actor Joe McFadden. He first appeared in the sixteenth series episode "Prince Among Men", broadcast on 28 January 2014. Raf is a Registrar General Surgeon, who joined the Acute Assessment Unit staff. He was introduced along with two other regular characters by the show's executive producer Oliver Kent in a bid to "shake things up". McFadden's casting was announced in September 2013, and he began filming the following month. He initially received a one-year contract with the show. To help him prepare for the role, McFadden watched open-heart surgery. McFadden departed in the nineteenth series episode "Group Animal, Part Two", broadcast on 7 December 2017, and returns for a single episode in the twenty-second series, broadcast on 21 July 2020. Raf is portrayed as "highly driven", passionate, moral and "very sensitive". McFadden took inspiration for some of Raf's personality traits from his Italian brother-in-law. Raf specialises in trauma and uses cutting-edge techniques in his work. The character's introductory scenes saw him save a young patient's life with improvised equipment, leading to conflict with the hospital's CEO Guy Self (John Michie). Raf's wife, consultant pharmacist Amy Teo (Wendy Kweh), was introduced two months later and it soon became clear that their marriage was strained by their fertility issues. Amy later conceived a child with Raf's rival Harry Tressler (Jules Knight), following a one-night stand.

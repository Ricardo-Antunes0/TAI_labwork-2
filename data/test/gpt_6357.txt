Physical Review Letters (PRL), established in 1958, is a quarterly scientific journal that covers all aspects of particle physics and its applications. PRL is owned by the American Physical Society and is published by Oxford University Press.  PRL is the premier journal for the dissemination of results from all aspects of particle physics and its applications. The journal publishes original theoretical and experimental papers, as well as reviews. It is also the primary forum for reporting new results in the field of high-energy physics. PRL covers a wide range of particle physics topics, including the latest results in collider physics, nuclear physics, and cosmology.

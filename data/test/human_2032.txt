WrestleMania 37 was the 37th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event aired on pay-per-view (PPV) worldwide and was available to stream through Peacock in the United States and the WWE Network internationally. The event took place as a two-night event on April 10 and 11, 2021, at the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. Following the merger of the WWE Network with Peacock in the United States in March 2021, WrestleMania 37 became the first major WWE event for which U.S. subscribers could only stream the event via Peacock's WWE Network channel. WWE Hall of Famers Hulk Hogan and Titus O'Neil served as the hosts of the event. The event was originally scheduled to take place on March 28, 2021, at the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California; however, due to COVID-19 restrictions in California, WWE rescheduled and moved the event to Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, which was the originally planned venue for WrestleMania 36 before the pandemic forced the event to be relocated and held behind closed doors at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Floridaâ€”in August 2020, Florida loosened its COVID-19 restrictions. As a result, the event marked the first time WWE had ticketed fans in attendance for an event during the COVID-19 pandemic, though to a limited capacity; the last WWE event to have ticketed fans was NXT on March 11, 2020, just before pandemic-related restrictions took effect. With the limited capacity, WWE claimed to have sold out of all available tickets and had an attendance of 25,675 spectators for each night, totaling 51,350 combined; however, this was disputed, with the actual number of tickets sold and the actual attendance number being around 20% lower than WWE's claimed numbers for both nights.

History In the early 1920s, Finnish communists and social democrats fought for control of Finnish Trade Union Federation and trade unions. However, employers did not recognize trade unions as negotiating partners and founded VExport Peacein 1920 to break the strikes. The key people in the establishment were Einar Ahlman , Director of Kymin Oy , and Gösta Serlachius, Director of GA Serlachius Oy. Counselor Serlachius had gone on a study trip to the United States and got the idea to form a strike organization. The establishment was prepared by the CEO and General Rudolf Waldén, CEO Jacob von Julin, Gösta Serlachius and CEO Carl Rosenlew. The inaugural meeting was held on February 28, 1920 where the "National Flying Work Corps" was formed. The name was soon changed to the Group Export Peace. The operation started quickly and without rules; however, care was taken to ensure that all hired workers were opposed to the strike.

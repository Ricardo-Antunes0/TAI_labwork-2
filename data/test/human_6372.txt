Palmerston Regional Hospital (PRH) is a public hospital in the outer suburbs of Darwin in the Northern Territory, Australia. It is located in Holtze, just north of the satellite city of Palmerston. It opened in 2018 as a campus of Royal Darwin Hospital (RDH), providing general medical inpatient care, rehabilitation services, elective and day surgeries to residents of Palmerston and the rural Litchfield Municipality. Staff are shared between both hospitals, as part of the Top End Health Service network. History In 1998, Territory Health Services considered the growing need for medical services in Palmerston and the Darwin rural area over the next ten years. A need for access to 24-hour acute care services was identified, as well as for dedicated women's health facilities, including a possible birthing centre. However, at this time it was considered that the costs to establish and maintain a hospital to meet this scope would be prohibitive and impact the overall efficiency of the local health system.

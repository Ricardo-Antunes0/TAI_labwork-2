The Casbah Recording Studio or simply Casbah is a recording studio in the Orange County suburb of Fullerton, California that helped to spawn several highly successful acts, including Berlin, Stacey Q, and Social Distortion. Founding of Casbah Casbah was founded in the late 1970s by bandmates Jon St. James, and Charles "Chaz" Ramirez, with money borrowed from St. James' parents. Initially it boasted only a TEAC 8-track tape machine, a mixing console and a few effects. St. James purchased additional electronic devices and rack mount equipment using money he earned doing a series of sound-alike jingles for the now-defunct Los Angeles rock and roll station KMET 94.7 FM. In the early 1980s,  the 8-track TEAC was replaced with a Tascam 16 track, which was considered the standard in many studios at the time.  It was on that reel-to-reel tape machine that Stacey Q's Better Than Heaven album was recorded. The Casbah attracted a variety of talent, including Righteous Brothers keyboardist John Van Tongeren and Berlin drummer, synthesist and producer Dan Van Patten, who lent their abilities to a variety of projects. As a songwriter, guitarist, and producer, St. James helped to bring the talents of techno-pop diva Stacey Q, the dance-pop duo Bardeux, and the dance-pop artist Katalina to a wide audience.

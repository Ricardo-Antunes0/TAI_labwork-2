The Royal Trust Company is a Canadian trust company that was founded in 1892 in Montreal, Quebec. By the late 20th century, it carried out trust, financial, real estate and deposit services in over 100 branches in Canada, the U.S. and overseas. In 1993, the company was bought by the Royal Bank of Canada, and Royal Trust is now part of RBC Wealth Management. History The Royal Trust Company was founded in 1892 as the Royal Trust and Fidelity Company when on 24 June of that year its articles of incorporation were assented by the Parliament of Quebec. The founding members were Edward S. Clouston, J. Burnett, Frank Paul, George A. Drummond, Richard B. Angus, David Burke, C. G. Clouston, John Cassils, R. D. McGibbon, Louis-Joseph Forget, Charles R. Hosmer, James Ross, Herbert S. Holt, and D. Macmaster. Of its charter board of 16 members, nine were members of the Bank of Montreal's board. The firm shared the premises of that bank from 1895. Donald Smith, who at the time presided over the Bank of Montreal, was the inaugural president of Royal Trust. In 1895, Royal Trust and Fidelity changed its name to Royal Trust Company.

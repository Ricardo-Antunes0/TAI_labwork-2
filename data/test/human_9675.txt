Jaime Lynn Herrera Beutler ( ; born November 3, 1978) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for . The district includes much of the southwestern quadrant of the state, but most of the voters live on the Washington side of the Portland metropolitan area. A Republican, Herrera Beutler was appointed to the Washington House of Representatives in 2007 and elected to that body in 2008. In 2010, she was elected to represent Washington's 3rd congressional district in Congress. Herrera Beutler has been reelected five times. Herrera Beutler was one of ten Republicans to vote to impeach Donald Trump after the January 6, 2021, siege of the U.S. Capitol. During the Senate trial, she issued a statement (after both sides had rested their cases) that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had said that he spoke by phone with Trump during the Capitol riot, asking him "to publicly and forcefully call off the riot" and for help with resources to defend the Capitol. According to Beutler, McCarthy said that Trump insisted that the rioters were with Antifa, not his supporters; McCarthy rejected the assertion. Her statement, via Twitter, said, "That's when, according to McCarthy, the president said: 'Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.'" The next day, lead House Impeachment Manager Jamie Raskin asked the Senate for permission to call her as a witness.

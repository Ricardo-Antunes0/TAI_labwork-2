Sepik virus (SEPV) is an arthropod-borne virus that was first identified in Papua New Guinea in 1992. The virus is spread through the bite of an infected arthropod, most commonly a mosquito. SEPV is a member of the genus Flavivirus, which is subfamily Flavivirinae within the family Flaviviridae. As of 2018 there is only one known case of human SEPV infection, in a patient from Papua New Guinea who developed fever and rash shortly after being bitten by an infected mosquito.

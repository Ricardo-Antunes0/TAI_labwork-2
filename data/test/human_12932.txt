Aphanomyces euteiches is a water mould, or oomycete, plant pathogen responsible for the disease Aphanomyces root rot. The species Aphanomyces euteiches can infect a variety of legumes.  Symptoms of the disease can differ among hosts but generally include reduced root volume and function, leading to stunting and chlorotic foliage.  Aphanomyces root rot is an important agricultural disease in the United States, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.  Management includes using resistant crop varieties and having good soil drainage, as well as testing soil for the pathogen to avoid infected fields. Hosts and symptoms Hosts of Aphanomyces euteiches can be annuals or perennials in the legume family, including: pea (Pisum sativum), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), snap bean and red kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), faba bean (Vicia faba), red clover (Trifolium pratense), and white clover (Trifolium repens).  Of particular concern is Aphanomyces euteiches f.sp. pisi, which is responsible for pea root rot and is the most economically damaging form of pea root rot.  In North America, genetically distinct populations of A. euteiches demonstrate host specificity, but such specificity has not been observed in Europe.

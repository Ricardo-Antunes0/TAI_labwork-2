The Bee Building, later called the Peters Apiary, is a historic building in Madison, Wisconsin, United States. It was built in 1854 by Luther Peters, and is a well-preserved example of New England apiary architecture. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.  The Bee Building is a two-story frame structure with a gable roof and clapboard siding. Its main facade features a three-bay front entrance with a round-arch window, and a single-story ell extending to the rear. The interior features an elaborate woodwork floor and ceiling, and an unusual apiary layout that includes hives in the main room and an observation deck on the second story.

Background On 26 May 2017, Hurts announced the release of a new album called Desire through their official Facebook page. They described it as an "album full of passion, pain and lust", stating that it has some of the best music they have ever made. Hurts' frontman Theo Hutchcraft told NME to expect a "big, personal, pop album". He said: "I guess this time we tried to just make a big pop record, and it's got echoes of all three records. There are all these avenues we've gone down in the past, take a little bit from there, little bit from here. But overall we just wanted to make a big, powerful pop record and that's definitely the track we're on." Lyrically, the album is meant to revolve around the duo's personal stories, as Hutchcraft mentioned: "We've just been a bit more personal on this record. We learn how to open up and we have different experiences."

Warner Mifflin (August 21, 1745 â€“ October 16, 1798) was an American abolitionist and an early advocate of reparations for slavery. Born and raised in Virginia, Mifflin established himself as a planter in Delaware in 1769. As a member of the Society of Friends, he was strongly opposed to slavery and became dedicated to assisting slaves who tried to free themselves, to defending free blacks from abuse, as well as encouraging Quakers and others to free their slaves. Early life and family Mifflin was born in Accomack County, Virginia on the Eastern Shore in 1745, into a slave-holding family descended from Quaker immigrants who arrived in New Jersey in 1677, one of the pioneering families of William Penn's "Holy Experiment". Although often sickly, he grew to be nearly seven feet tall, with a confident, charismatic personality. He was a second cousin of the more famous Thomas Mifflin of Pennsylvania. The several dozen slaves on the family's plantation produced cereals, flax, fruit, and livestock. The young Mifflin's conscience was troubled as he came to understand that the children he had played with growing up on his father's plantation were slaves.

Philip C. Hanawalt (born 1931) is an American graphic artist and illustrator. He is known for his humorous, often irreverent illustrations that often feature puns and wordplay.  Hanawalt was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1931. He studied at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, graduating in 1954. He then worked as a commercial artist before entering the comics industry in the early 1960s. His first professional work was for Verotik, a short-lived satirical magazine.  In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hanawalt became well-known for his illustrations for Mad magazine. He also began producing his own comic books, including "Bundys" (1971), "Philosophy of the World" (1972), and "The Scaredy Cat" (1973). His work has been featured in publications including The New Yorker, Rolling Stone, The Times Literary Supplement, and The Smithsonian Magazine.  Hanawalt's later work has tended to feature themes of humor and whimsy. His 2010 book "Laughing Mad: A Collection of Humorous Cartoons" is a collection of his earlier comic strips re-edited with new commentary and commentary from the artists who created them. His latest book is "Monkey Mutilation: A Collection of Oddball Drawings from America's Best Comics" (2015).

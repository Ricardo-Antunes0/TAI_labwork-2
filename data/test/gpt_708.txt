He studied at the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles before moving to New York City in the late 1920s. There he began working as a illustrator for pulp magazines, painting covers and illustrations for stories about cowboys, Indians, and other Wild West subjects.  In the 1940s Leighton began painting landscapes of the American West. His early works were influenced by the works of Edward Hopper and Andrew Wyeth, but he soon developed his own style which was characterized by rich colors, dramatic light and shadow, and expressive brushwork. Leighton's landscapes are often set against ruggedly beautiful scenery, depicting scenes of cattle ranches, ghost towns, and desert sand dunes.  Leighton also produced a large number of sculptures which are often characterized by their rough-hewn surfaces and unfinished look. His subjects include people, horses, dogs, bears, and other animals, as well as landscapes.

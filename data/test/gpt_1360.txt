Remote sensing in oceanography is a widely used term for the acquisition of information about the ocean environment from a distance. Remote sensing instruments collect data on a variety of parameters such as temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a concentration, and wind speed and direction. These measurements are then processed to produce images or models of the ocean surface.  Remote sensing has been used in oceanography since the early days of the discipline. Early instrumentation consisted of simple thermometers, barometers, and hygrometers that were mounted on ships or buoys to measure sea surface conditions. As technology improved, so did the capabilities of remote sensing instruments. Today, there are a variety of instruments available that can measure a variety of oceanographic parameters.  Remote sensing has several important benefits for oceanographers. First, it allows us to collect data from locations that are difficult or impossible to reach with manned vessels. Second, remote sensing can provide continuous data streams that can be used to track changes in ocean conditions over time. Finally, remote sensing can provide detailed information about short-term variability in ocean conditions that is not possible to obtain using traditional observational methods.  Despite its many benefits, there are a few limitations to remote sensing in oceanography. First, remote sensing data may be noisy and inaccurate due to the nature of the instruments and the environment they operate in. Second, remote sensing data may not be sufficient for understanding long-term changes in ocean conditions. Third, remote sensing data is often limited in scope, providing only limited information about

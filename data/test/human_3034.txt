Since ending his career as referee, Amerell has worked as an official of the Deutscher Fußball-Bund, most recently as a referee spokesman for the more than 80,000 active referees in the Deutscher Fußball-Bund. In this position, he repeatedly criticized the player's lack of respect for referee decisions and what he believed to be inappropriate behaviour by club officials on the side lines, to which he spoke of "hypocrites on the bench" who would contribute to a "brutalization" of soccer. For the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, Amerell commented on current referee decisions in the "Nach-Spiel" column. He ran a hotel until November 2010, in Haunstetten, a district of Augsburg. Amerell was married and had two adult twin daughters. He lived separated from his wife. He was found dead in his Munich apartment on 11 December 2012.

The Bled is a self-titled EP by hardcore band The Bled. Its four songs were pressed on one-sided 12" vinyl, released in 2002 by Ambit Records. It was a small DIY release, without much marketing attempt. Production was limited to only 666 copies, 100 of which were on translucent blood-red vinyl. The other remaining 566 were pressed on black vinyl, and placed into black or white sleeves.  The album art was sprayed on and the numbers handwritten. It was recorded before current singer James Munoz joined the band. Before the bled's reputation grew, the guy (unknown) that funded this pressing project didn't make much attempt to sell them.  Some of the earlier copies that were sold or given out had no art work on them at all.  Later, as the band's success grew, the guy (still a mystery) that had them decided to spray paint the sleeves, hand number them, and started putting them out there to sell at places such as interpunk.  The bled had no say so in the design of the simple art scheme that was painted on the sleeves.

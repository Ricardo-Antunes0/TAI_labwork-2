Cointegration is a statistical property of a time series that describes how the values of the series are related. Cointegration is a type of autocorrelation.  Cointegration can be used to identify relationships between time series, and can help to explain patterns in the data. It can also be used to improve predictions made using time-series models.  Cointegration is often used in economic forecasting, as it can help to identify patterns in economic data that may not be apparent using other methods. It can also be used to improve predictions made using economic models.

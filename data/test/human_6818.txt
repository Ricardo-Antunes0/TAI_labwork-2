Silver Sun are a British power pop band, who formed in 1995 in Camden, London.  They released their self-titled debut album in 1997, and after two major label releases that saw moderate success, the band released two further albums independently. Their sound is a combination of harder-edged alternative rock and classic power pop, with an emphasis on multi-layered vocal harmonies. Career They were initially called Sun..! and released their first EP under that name. They were forced to alter the name soon afterwards, and chose 'Silver' after The Beatles' original name, 'The Silver Beetles', also The Beatles` song "It`s All Too Much" from "Yellow Submarine" has a line 'Set me on a silver sun, for I know that I'm free'. The single "Lava" was their first under the new name.  Groups such as Super Furry Animals also wrote music in a similar style at the time, although there are also notable parallels with US bands such as Jellyfish and the earlier output of Weezer.

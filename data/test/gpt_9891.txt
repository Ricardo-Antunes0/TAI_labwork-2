In telecommunications and radar, a reflective array antenna is an antenna type that uses a large number of small antennas to reflect a signal back to its source. The use of reflective arrays allows for a large surface area to be used in antenna design, which can improve the antenna's performance in specific applications.  A reflective array antenna is an antenna type that uses a large number of small antennas to reflect a signal back to its source. The use of reflective arrays allows for a large surface area to be used in antenna design, which can improve the antenna's performance in specific applications.   Reflective arrays are used in many telecommunications and radar systems, such as satellite television and commercial air traffic control. By using many small antennas instead of one or two large antennas, the reflective array can cover a much larger area, which can improve the antenna's performance in these systems. This technology is also being used in military systems, such as the Army's Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance System (CVRS).

Cytokines are a broad and loose category of signaling molecules that affect many aspects of cellular function. They can be secreted directly by cells, or can be produced indirectly by the action of other cells. Cytokines are often produced in response to a variety of stimuli, such as infection, injury, or inflammation.   Cytokines have been shown to play an important role in the regulation of many cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. They are also known to play a role in the development and progression of several diseases, including cancer. Cytokines are often used as therapeutic agents to treat a variety of conditions, including inflammatory diseases, autoimmune disorders, and cancer.

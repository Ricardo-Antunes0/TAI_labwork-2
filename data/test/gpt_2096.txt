Darryl & Lori Schroeder Park (formerly known as Schroeder Park Racetrack) was a horse racing track located in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It operated from 1924 to 1988.  The Schroeder Park Racetrack was built in 1924 by Darryl and Lori Schroeder. The track originally operated as a horseracing venue, with a capacity of 1,000 spectators. It became known as Schroeder Park Racetrack in 1938 after the Schroeders purchased the track from its previous owner, Colonel A.W. Schroeder. The track hosted thoroughbred racing events until 1988, when it was closed due to declining attendance rates.  The racetrack was later used as a training ground for race horses owned by Darryl and Lori Schroeder's son, Terry Schroeder. The track is currently used for automobile racing events.

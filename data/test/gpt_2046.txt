Road racing is a form of motorsport that uses roads as the primary venue for racing cars. The sport can be divided into two categories based on the type of road used: open-wheel racing and stock car racing.  Road racing evolved from bicycle racing, which began in the late 19th century as a means of promoting the sport. Early races involved a single lap around a circular track. As cars became available, races became longer and began using circuit tracks. Today, road racing is a popular sport worldwide with many major events taking place on circuits including the Formula One World Championship, the Indianapolis 500, and the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

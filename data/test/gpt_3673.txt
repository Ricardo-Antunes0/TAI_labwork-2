Giovanni Battista Ricci (Novara, circa 1537 â€“ Rome, 1610) was an Italian polymath who made significant contributions to the fields of mathematics, physics, engineering, and architecture. He has been described as the father of modern mathematics.  Ricci was a highly versatile mathematician who made significant discoveries in several areas of mathematics. He is best known for his work in calculus, which led to the development of the infinitesimal calculus. In physics, he developed a theory of elasticity that is still considered highly influential. Additionally, he was one of the first architects to use structural engineering principles in building projects.  Ricci was also an accomplished painter and sculptor. His most famous work is the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.

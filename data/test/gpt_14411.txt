Queens Borough Hall is a public building located in the borough of Queens in New York City. The hall is the seat of local government for Queens and is also the administrative center for the New York City Police Department's 108th Precinct. The building, designed by architect Cass Gilbert, was completed in 1930 and originally served as the main municipal building for the newly created borough of Queens.  Queens Borough Hall has been used as the backdrop to major events in New York City history, including the 1942 dedication of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the 1963 March on Washington. It also served as the location for President-elect Barack Obama's election night celebration in November 2008.  The building is located at 45-09 Queens Boulevard in northern Queens, between Vernon Boulevard and Jackson Avenue.

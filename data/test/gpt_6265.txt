Bulk billing is a payment option under which a health care provider charges a patient for services provided in bulk, rather than charging for each service individually.  Bulk billing can be beneficial to patients as it allows them to receive care from a provider more quickly and at a lower cost. Physicians may bulk bill for services such as prescription drugs, medical tests, and surgeries. However, patients may be concerned about potential abuse of the system by providers who charge for services that are not actually necessary.

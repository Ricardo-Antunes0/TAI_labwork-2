Saron, Aberaman was a Welsh Independent (Congregationalist) chapel in Davies Street, Aberaman, formed as an initiative of the David Price of Siloa, Aberdare, soon after the development of Aberaman as an industrial settlement as a result of the activities of Crawshay Bailey and David Davis, Blaengwawr. Saron was claimed to be the largest chapel in the Cynon Valley although Calvaria, Abercynon, Ebenezer, Trecynon and Siloa, Aberdare all had a similar capacity. Foundation and early history The history of the cause at Saron can be traced to meetings held from November 1846 at a house in Cardiff Road, Aberaman, where Thomas Jones, minister of Adulam, Merthyr Tydfil had come to live and keep a school. At this time, the village of Aberaman was at a very early stage in its development as an industrial centre and, as workers frequently migrated in and out of the area the membership of the nascent church fluctuated. Soon, however the house became too small and the congregation moved to the nearby Lamb and Flag. The premises were owned by one Thomas Howells, but the holding of meetings in a public house, although far from unusual in those days, led to a split among the members and the meetings reverted to the house of Thomas Jones. When he died in January 1848 the future of the church was uncertain.

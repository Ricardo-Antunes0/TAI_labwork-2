An expansion tube is a type of telescope eyepiece that is used to enlarge an image of a celestial object. The eyepiece is mounted in a tube that extends from the telescope's objective lens. When the telescope is pointed at a celestial object, the eyepiece collects light and projects it onto the object's focal plane, which magnifies the image.

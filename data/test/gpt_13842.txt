Pareiorhaphis is a genus of catfish in the family Ictaluridae. It contains the single species Pareiorhaphis punctata, which is found in the Amazon basin.  The genus Pareiorhaphis was first described by the English biologist John Edward Gray in 1859. The genus is named after the Ancient Greek physician and anatomist, Pareias (PÃ¡rias), who lived in the first century BC. The only species in the genus, Pareiorhaphis punctata, was first described by American ichthyologist Samuel Garman in 1892. The genus is monotypic, containing only the single species.  Pareiorhaphis punctata is a small fish measuring between 3 and 4 inches (7.6 and 10.2 cm) in total length. It has a slender body shape with a long dorsal fin and a short anal fin. The fish has dark brown or black scales and a yellow or light green tinge to its skin. The males have larger fins and are more brightly coloured than the females.  Pareiorhaphis punctata is endemic to the Amazon basin and is found in rivers and streams with fast flowing water. It inhabits areas with plenty of vegetation, including rapids and riffles. The fish feeds on small insects, crustaceans, and other invertebrates that it finds in the water column or on the bottom of the river.

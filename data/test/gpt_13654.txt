Acronychia suberosa , commonly known as corky woodruff, is a small shrub or small tree in the family Ericaceae. It is endemic to southeastern Australia, where it grows in wetter areas near creeks, rivers and sea-shore.  The bark is smooth and grey, with corky glands scattered over the surface. The leaves are opposite, linear to lance-shaped with serrated edges, and measure up to 10 cm long. The flowers are white, borne in clusters of up to 10, and have a sweet scent. The fruit is a small leathery capsule.  Acronychia suberosa is very rare, and is threatened by habitat loss.

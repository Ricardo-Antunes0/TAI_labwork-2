The State Forestry Corps (Italian: Corpo forestale dello Stato or CFS) was a national police agency in Italy. It was established on 15 October 1822 by Charles Felix of Sardinia as Amministrazione forestale per la custodia e la vigilanza dei boschi. The five Italian autonomous regions have their own corps of forestry police under regional or provincial control (Corpo forestale regionale/provinciale), which have not been disbanded. CFS was dissolved on December 31, 2016 and all personnel become militarized and absorbed  by the Carabinieri's Comando unit√† per la tutela forestale, ambientale e agroalimentare. Mission The CFS had police powers and acted as a park ranger force responsible for protecting Italy's natural resources, the environment, countryside and ecosystems, especially national parks and national forests. It also acted as a criminal investigative department and as a typical police force. Its specialist duties included arresting poachers, investigating environmental violations, illegal building, counterfeit foods, safeguarding protected animal species, enforcing endangered species laws, and preventing and fighting wildfires through 15 regional commands and its fleet of 22 fire-fighting aircraft. It had responsibility for managing activities related to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in Italy.

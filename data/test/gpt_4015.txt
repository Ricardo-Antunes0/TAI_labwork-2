Marine microorganisms are defined by their habitat and mode of life, which is typically aquatic. Marine microorganisms are divided into two groups: marine bacteria and marine fungi. Marine bacteria are typically found in marine water while marine fungi are typically found on land. Marine microbes play important roles in the marine environment by breaking down organic material and synthesizing new molecules.

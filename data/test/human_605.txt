Bonaire is an unincorporated community in Houston County in the U.S. state of Georgia. It is  south of the center of Warner Robins and is part of the Warner Robins Metropolitan Statistical Area. Bonaire is located on and around U.S. Route 129/Georgia State Route 247, which is connected to Interstate 75 by Georgia State Route 96. Bonaire is the hometown of former state Governor and 31st United States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. History The inhabitants of the area formed Bonaire around the newly laid Georgia Southern & Florida railway when it came through in 1888. Newspaper records in 1888 uniformly spell it without the final "e", but in 1889 the modern spelling began to be used (perhaps because the post office was registered with that spelling on Dec 3, 1888). The name is reputedly of French origin, meaning "good air". The Georgia General Assembly incorporated Bonaire in 1912. The town's charter was dissolved in 1995.

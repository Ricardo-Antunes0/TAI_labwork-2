The Graham-White Type VII "Popular" was an early British aircraft designed  by J. D. North and built by the Grahame-White Aviation company, with the intention of producing a low-cost aircraft to popularize aviation. It was initially produced with a 35 hp Anzani 3-cylinder Y configuration engine and offered for sale at a price of less than £400.  Despite its low price the aircraft included structural refinements such as hollow-section interplane struts. It was first flown in 1913. Design and development The aircraft was a pusher biplane with a square section nacelle mounted between the upper and lower wings, which  were of two-spar construction, the spars being ash I-sections. To maintain the leading edge section there were half-ribs between each rib, these extending from the leading edge to the main spar. A single horizontal tailplane with a split elevator and a rudder divided into two part, half above and half below the tailplane, were carried on ash booms behind the wing, the booms being connected by hollow wooden vertical struts and tubular steel horizontal members. The booms were spindled to an I-section except at the points of attachment of the cross-members.    The upper wing was double the span of the lower and had wide-span ailerons occupying the whole trailing edge outboard of the tail booms. The wings were connected by a single pair of struts on either side, the outer section of the upper wing being braced by wires leading to inverted-V kingposts.  The wide-track undercarriage consisted of a pair of long laminated wood skids each bearing  pair of wheels on a short axle. No tailskid was fitted.

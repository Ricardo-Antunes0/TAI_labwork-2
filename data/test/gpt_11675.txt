Cold air damming, or CAD, is a water management technique used in the United States to control floods. Cold air damming is a type of air control where cold air is released from a dammed area, causing the water level in the dammed area to rise and preventing or reducing flooding.  Cold air dams are most commonly used in flood control and provide an economical means of controlling flooding. In flood control, they are used to prevent or reduce inundation of properties downstream by lowering the water level in a reservoir. In addition, they can be used to improve water quality by removing contaminants before they reach downstream waters.  Cold air dams work by releasing cold air from the dammed area. This cold air causes the water level in the dammed area to rise and prevents or reduces flooding. The use of cold air dams has several benefits: they are less expensive than traditional flood control methods, they are effective in controlling floods, and they improve water quality.

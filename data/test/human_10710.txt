Apple Jam is a bonus disc included as the third LP record in English rock musician George Harrison's 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass. It consists of four instrumental jams, three of which were recorded during the album sessions, and "It's Johnny's Birthday", a 30th birthday tribute to John Lennon. The disc was Apple Records' way of placating record buyers for the high retail price of All Things Must Pass, which was one of the first triple albums in rock. It was given a dedicated design by Tom Wilkes, with a logo depicting a jam jar and apple leaves. Two of the jams date from a 18 June 1970 session that marked the official formation of Eric Clapton's band Derek and the Dominos as recording artists. Augmented by Harrison and guitarist Dave Mason, and produced by Phil Spector, the group recorded songs intended for their debut single that same day. Other tracks on Apple Jam include musical contributions from Billy Preston, Klaus Voormann, Ginger Baker, Gary Wright and Bobby Keys. Music critics have traditionally viewed the jams as dispensable next to the two LPs of songs. Some writers nevertheless recognise the disc's historical importance as a document of Derek and the Dominos' first recording session.

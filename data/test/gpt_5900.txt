Michael Synkellos , also spelled Syncellus (c. 760 – c. 827) was a Byzantine monk, historian and grammarian who is best known for his work on the history of the Byzantine Empire.  Born in the city of Thessalonica in 760, Synkellos spent most of his life in Constantinople, where he became a monk and tutor to the children of Emperor Michael III. In 824, he composed an account of the history of the Byzantine Empire from its beginnings to that date, which was published posthumously.  Synkellos also wrote several grammars and dictionaries, which were used by Byzantine scholars for centuries after his death. He is considered one of the greatest historians of Byzantium and one of the most important scholars of his time.

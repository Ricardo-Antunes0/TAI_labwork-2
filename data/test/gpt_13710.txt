ARDB also known as Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database is a public database that contains the genetic sequences of antibiotic resistance genes from a variety of bacteria.  The Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database (ARDB) is a public database that contains the genetic sequences of antibiotic resistance genes from a variety of bacteria. The ARDB was established in 2006 by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as part of its efforts to better understand and combat the spread of antibiotic resistance. The ARDB is made up of sequences from more than 2,500 strains of bacteria collected from around the world. The database is searchable by strain, gene name, and antibiotic resistance class.  The ARDB has been used to study the spread of antibiotic resistance and to identify new sources of resistance. In addition, the ARDB has been used to develop new antibiotics and to improve our understanding of how resistance develops.

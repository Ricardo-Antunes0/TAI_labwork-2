Henry John Almond (17 April 1850 – 21 October 1892) was an English philosopher and psychologist. He is chiefly remembered for his work in philosophy of mind, but he also wrote on ethics, aesthetics and religion.  Henry John Almond was born on 17 April 1850 in the small town of Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. He was the eldest son of a Congregational minister, John Almond, and his wife Martha née Liddell. As a boy, he showed an early interest in mathematics and physics, which led him to study at Trinity College, Cambridge. After graduating in 1873 with a first-class honours degree in mathematics, he went on to study philosophy at University College London under the tutorship of William James.  In 1878 Almond became a lecturer at University College London. In 1892 he was appointed professor of philosophy at University College London (the first person to hold this position), but he died two years later from pneumonia.  Almond is chiefly remembered for his work in philosophy of mind, but he also wrote on ethics, aesthetics and religion. His most famous philosophical work is Mind and Its Place in Nature (1892), which argued that mental phenomena are not reducible to physical phenomena and that mental states cannot be causally explained by physical events. His other notable books include The Representative Function (1885), The Principles of Psychology (1890), and The Nature of Aesthetic Experience (1893).

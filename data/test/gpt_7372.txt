Allan Eugene Sims (born April 18, 1953) is an American former professional baseball player, coach and manager. He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox, Philadelphia Phillies and Detroit Tigers from 1973 to 1989.  Sims was known for his defensive skills, and he was a five-time All-Star and won three Silver Slugger Awards. He led the American League in fielding percentage twice, and finished in the top five in total catches (2,539), total bases (5,707) and doubles (469). He remained a starter throughout his career, batting leadoff or in the middle of the lineup.  As a manager, Sims was unable to duplicate the success of his playing days. He was fired by the Tigers after leading them to a second-place finish in the 1989 season. After two seasons out of baseball, he served as the Red Sox' bench coach from 1992 to 1994. He then became the manager of the Phillies from 1995 to 1999. He was fired following the 1999 season after compiling a record of 458â€“481 (.490). Sims has since been involved in broadcasting and coaching for MLB teams.

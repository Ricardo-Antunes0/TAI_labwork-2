The Brabham BT3 is a Formula One racing car that was designed and built by Brabham Racing Organisation (BRO) for the 1973 season.  The BT3 was the third and final car design by Gordon Murray, who had been working for BRO since 1962. The BT3 was a major departure from the successful BT2 car, which had been powered by a 1.5-litre Coventry-Climax engine. The BT3 was powered by a 1.5-litre Cosworth DFV engine, which gave it a significant advantage in terms of power and performance over its competitors.  The BT3 was successful in its debut season, winning two races and finishing second in the Drivers' Championship to Graham Hill. However, the car's success was not matched by consistent results in subsequent seasons, and it retired from the championship after only three years. The BT3 remains one of the most successful Formula One cars of all time, with over 100 wins and six world championships.

Francis Xavier "Moose" Goheen (February 8, 1894 – November 13, 1979) was an American amateur ice hockey forward. While enrolled at the Valparaiso University, Goheen was a skilled, three-sport athlete competing in football and baseball, in addition to hockey. Goheen was a member of the St. Paul Athletic Club team that won United States Amateur Hockey championship and received the MacNaughton Cup in the 1915-16 season. After that season, Goheen enlisted in the United States Army and served in the European theatre during World War I in the Army's signal corps. After his service in the Army, Goheen returned to the St. Paul Athletic Club and won a second league championship and MacNaughton Cup in 1920. Goheen also competed in the 1920 Summer Olympics as the captain and rover for the American ice hockey team, which won the silver medal. Outside of hockey, Goheen was dedicated to his career with the Northern States Power Company in St. Paul, so much so that he declined to play with United States Olympic hockey team in the 1924 Olympics in Chamonix, France and spurned multiple contract offers to play in the NHL with the Boston Bruins (in 1926) and Toronto Maple Leafs. In 1952, Moose Goheen was inducted to the Hockey Hall of Fame; at the time, he was only the second American to have been inducted (after Hobey Baker) and the first Minnesotan. He was also elected to the Minnesota Sports Hall of Fame in 1958 and to the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1973. In 1924, in a 1–0 victory over Boston for the St. Paul Saints, Goheen scored a goal using a slap shot—the earliest record of the feat.

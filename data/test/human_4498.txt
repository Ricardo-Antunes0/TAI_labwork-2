In mathematical finance, fugit is the expected (or optimal) date to exercise an American- or Bermudan option. It is useful for hedging purposes here; see Greeks (finance) and .  The term was first introduced by Mark Garman in an article "Semper tempus fugit" published in 1989.  The Latin term "tempus fugit" means "time flies" and Garman suggested the name because "time flies especially when you're having fun managing your book of American options". Details Fugit provides an estimate of when an option would be exercised, which is then a useful indication for the maturity to use when hedging American or Bermudan products with European options.  Fugit is thus used for the hedging of convertible bonds, equity linked convertible notes, and any putable or callable exotic coupon notes.  Although see  and  for qualifications here. Fugit is also useful in estimating "the (risk-neutral) expected life of the option"  for Employee stock options (note the brackets).

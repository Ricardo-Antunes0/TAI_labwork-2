Laxmangudi Krishnamurthy Doraiswamy (1927â€“2012) was an Indian mathematician who made significant contributions to analysis, combinatorics and graph theory.  Born in 1927 in Tamil Nadu, Doraiswamy completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Madras in 1949, before moving to the United States to continue his studies at the University of California, Berkeley. There, he worked with Leonhard Euler and Alfred Tarski, earning his doctorate in 1955.  Doraiswamy returned to India the following year, and spent the rest of his career at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay), where he served as the head of the mathematics department from 1978 until his retirement in 2000. During that time, he also served as a visiting professor at several universities around the world.  Doraiswamy is best known for his work in analysis, combinatorics and graph theory. In particular, he was a pioneer in the application of operator theory to mathematical problems arising in these fields, and developed several important algorithms for solving graph problems. He also made significant contributions to extremal combinatorics and probabilistic analysis.  Doraiswamy died at IIT Bombay on 14 November 2012 after a long illness.

HMS Albion (R07), nicknamed "The Old Greyhound" is a Type 22 frigate of the Royal Navy. She was built by Swan Hunter at their yard in Wallsend-on-Tyne and launched on 30 March 1991.  She is the third ship to be named after the Albion of Britain, which was a famous warship in the 16th and 17th centuries. The first HMS Albion was a 16th century warship that played an important role in the English victory over the Spanish Armada. The second HMS Albion was a 19th century ironclad warship that fought in both the Crimean War and the Second Boer War.  HMS Albion has been deployed to participate in several United Nations peacekeeping operations, most notably Operation Palliser in Haiti, Operation Veritas in the Solomon Islands and Operation Proteus off the coast of Sierra Leone. She has also participated in a number of NATO operations, including Operation Active Endeavour in support of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, Operation Atalanta in support of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) mandate to protect European Union interests in Albania and Operation Active Shield in support of NATO's Response Force (NRF) during the Russian annexation of Crimea.  In September 2014 HMS Albion deployed to the Gulf of Aden as part of Operation Martello to provide humanitarian assistance following a devastating tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people. In January 2015 she returned to Portsmouth for repairs, returning to duty in March.

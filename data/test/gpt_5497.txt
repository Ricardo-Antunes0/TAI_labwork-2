The word "sloth" comes from the Portuguese word "slovo" meaning "slow". The first known mention of a sloth was in 1502, when it was described by Amerigo Vespucci. Sloths are thought to have originated in South America, but they have been found as far north as North Carolina and as far south as Paraguay. They are currently found only in South America and parts of Central America.  Sloths belong to the family Megalonychidae, which is made up of two extant genera and seven species. All sloths except for one (the two-toed sloth) have two toes on each foot, and all have a long tail that they use to help them hang upside down in trees. Sloths are able to move around by hanging from branches with their tails and use their front limbs only for locomotion on the ground.  Sloths are herbivores and eat mainly leaves, but they will also eat fruit, flowers, and even small insects. They spend

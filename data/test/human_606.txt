Jeffrey Brian "Jeff" Garner (born August 18, 1978) is an American fashion designer and visual artist. His designs are sold online and in luxury boutiques throughout America, Canada, the UK and China. His designs have been worn to the Academy Awards and on stage. He is perhaps best known for his sustainable 'plant-dyed' red carpet gowns (made mostly in Tennessee) and for inclusion in the Smithsonian's Renwick Gallery 40 under 40 exhibition in July 2012. Garner takes his inspiration from the dressmakers of the Civil War period who worked with what was in front of them, fashioning beautiful gowns that were later taken apart to recreate new dresses â€“ sustainability born out of necessity. Garner's designs have a sophistication that sets them apart from typical organic clothing. With Prophetik, Jeff Garner combines a dandyish, rock 'n' roll aesthetic with a robust sustainable philosophy, never compromising his ethical principals or his style credentials. That's why everyone from Kings of Leon to Taylor Swift wears his designs. Early life  He was born in the Civil War town of Franklin, Tennessee to Don and Peggy Lynn Garner, a business owner and mother respectively . He was raised on a horse farm outside Nashville.

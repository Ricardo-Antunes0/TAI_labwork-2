David P. Currie (1936â€“2007) was the Edward R. Murrow Professor of Journalism at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He was a pioneer in the use of computer-based newsgathering techniques and was the first journalist to win a Pulitzer Prize for electronic journalism.  Currie was born in 1936 in Stoughton, Wisconsin. He received his B.S. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1958 and his M.S. from MIT in 1959. He started his career as a reporter for the Milwaukee Journal in 1959, and joined the staff of the Boston Globe in 1961. In 1963, he became one of the first journalists to use computers to gather news, and he was subsequently awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his work on the Vietnam War. He also won two Emmy Awards for his reporting on the Watergate scandal.  Currie retired from MIT in 2002, but continued to teach there until his death in 2007. He was also a visiting professor at universities around the world.

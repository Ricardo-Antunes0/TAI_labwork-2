Kavus was the 32nd ruler of Shirvan. He was a son of Shirvanshah Keykubad I and older brother of Prince Sultan Muhammad. Co-reign According to sources, he began ruling in name of his father in 1348, due to Keykubad's advanced age. He was styled as "Lord of Shamakhy and Shirvan" in youth. He sought to gain strong alliance with Chupanid Malek Ashraf, as he travelled to his court and submitted to him. However, Malek Ashraf then unexpectedly killed a nobleman named amir Wafa b. Haji Shahriban in front of his eyes. Kavus was horrified and immediately returned to Shirvan. Soon, Malek Ashraf sent his envoys Khawja Abdulhay and Akhijuq Malik to Shirvan and to express his desire to marry a daughter of Shirvanshah Keykubad I. Kavus denied the demand, and, frustrated because of denial, Malek marched on Shirvan but was repelled and forced to make peace. He attacked Shirvan once again in the winter of 1347, but Kavus and his father took shelter in the well guarded castles of Shirvan. After this invasion, sources do not mention Shirvanshah Keykubad I, and he probably died of old age between 1348 and 1356.

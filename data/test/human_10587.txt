The Broadcaster was an English language local community tabloid newspaper published by several owners in Western Sydney, New South Wales, Australia that principally covered the Municipality of Holroyd and surrounding districts. It was first published in Guildford in 1932, but became a title of The Biz newspaper publishing company located in Fairfield, in 1935. The Broadcaster eventually came under the control of Cumberland Newspapers in 1958 and was retitled the Merrylands Broadcaster from April 1975. The newspaper ceased publication around 1978. History First published in 1932 by David Hume from his parents' home at 18 Fairview Street, Guildford, New South Wales and printed by the North Shore Press in North Sydney, The Broadcaster was a free weekly local newspaper published on Thursdays throughout Merrylands, Guildford, Fairfield, Smithfield, Canley Vale, Cabramatta, Liverpool and surrounding districts. It reported on local government issues, local community organisation and sporting activities, personal news, including family notices, and advertising of local businesses. O. H.

It premiered in Ankara, Turkey, in 2018 and was restaged at Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, Russia, in 2019. Overview  Troy was composed by Bujor Hoinic, the Romanian chief conductor of the Turkish State Opera and Ballet. The libretto was written by Artun Hoinic. It is the first Turkish opera written and composed by foreigners. Based on the 8th-century BC Greek epic poem Iliad by Homer, the opera was completed in May 2018 after three-and-half months' work. The eight scenes of the two-act opera handle the war and life at Troy (modern Hisarlik, northwestern Turkey). To Hoinic "it blends an ancient civilization with modern music, where ancient modes, secret makams and Anatolian rhythms are used, too". The premiere took place at ATO Congresium in Ankara, Turkey, performed by Ankara State Opera and Ballet on 9 November 2018. The opera was commissioned by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism as part of the "2018 Tourism Year of Troy" in Turkey, declared in connection with the 20th anniversary of Troy's entry into the UNESCO World Heritage Site list.

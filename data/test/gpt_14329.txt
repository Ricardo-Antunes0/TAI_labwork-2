The northern brown howler (Alouatta guariba guariba) is a medium-sized mammal endemic to the tropical moist lowland forests of South America. The northern brown howler is the only extant species of howler monkey.  The northern brown howler is the smallest and most southerly of the three howler monkey subspecies. It is also the rarest and most endangered of the three, with an estimated population size of only 1,000 to 2,000 individuals. The northern brown howler is considered Critically Endangered by the IUCN, as it faces intense threats from deforestation, hunting, and the fragmentation and degradation of its forest habitat.

A beneficiary (also, in trust law, cestui que trust or cestui que vie) is a person who receives benefits from an estate or trust. Beneficiaries may be individuals, corporations, or other legal entities.  Beneficiaries may include descendants, successors, and other individuals or entities who would otherwise be excluded from ownership or control of the property or assets of the trust. Beneficiaries may also include organizations that are beneficiaries under other types of trusts.  Beneficiaries are usually named in a will or trust instrument and may receive cash, securities, real estate, or other assets. They may also have rights to receive income or to manage the trust property. If the trust has terms that allow it to distribute assets to beneficiaries upon the death of the creator of the trust, then those beneficiaries are sometimes called "settlers".

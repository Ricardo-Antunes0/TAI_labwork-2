Sigismund Casimir Vasa (; 1 April 1640 – 9 August 1647), was a Polish prince and the only legitimate son of King Ladislaus IV and his first wife Queen Cecilia Renata. He was named after his grandfather Sigismund III, and uncle John Casimir. Biography He was raised by the governess Rozyna Małgorzata von Eckenberg. As he was an only child, he was the almost certain candidate as the successor of Ladislaus IV. The French traveller, Le Laboureur described him as a child: extremely vivid, lean and agile. He was also seen as being quick-minded, he was a fast learner, and by the age of seven, he was fluent in not only Polish but German too, and made good progress in Latin. The prince willingly dressed in the Polish fashion, which still further strengthened his position as candidate and endeared him to the Poles themselves. In fact, when someone scolded him in German, he replied in Polish "...I am a Pole, so talk to me in Polish".

Radio Music Shop was a UK radio station which broadcast from London from 1967 to 2007. The station was owned by the Independent Radio Broadcasting Authority and was one of the first commercially operated radio stations in the UK to specialise in rock and roll music.  Radio Music Shop played a mix of rock and roll, pop and soul music, with an emphasis on rare and previously unheard recordings. The station helped to introduce many classic rock recordings to a new audience, and its DJs played a significant role in the development of British rock music.  In 2007, Radio Music Shop merged with BBC Radio 6 Music, forming BBC Radio 6 Music & Radio Music Shop. The new station retained the Radio Music Shop name but also incorporated some of the programming from BBC6 Music.   In early 2013, it was announced that BBC Radio 6 Music & Radio Music Shop would be merged into BBC Radio 1, with the latter becoming a sister station to BBC Radio 1Xtra. The merger was completed on 1 January 2014.

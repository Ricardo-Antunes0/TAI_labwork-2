The Kibaale Community Schools are Christian schools in the Rakai District of Uganda. They are now primarily funded and administered by the Pacific Academy Outreach Society (PAOS) which is part of the Pacific Academy, a Christian school in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. History of the Kibaale community center & schools They were originally started by Glad Tidings Church in Vancouver (a Pentecostal congregation), Canada and began its work in Uganda in 1960. Glad Tidings established a bible training centre and hundreds of community churches around this time period. However, during the tyrannical military dictatorship of Idi Amin, the economy collapsed, communication systems broke down, the cities and towns deteriorated and, in 1973, the church was driven underground. While the period was devastating and many people died, one of the positive experiences that came out of it was that the local people recognized that they had to provide their own leadership, carry out their own programs and not be dependent on outside leadership and resources.

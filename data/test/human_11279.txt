George Herbert Sheldon (May 17, 1874 â€“ November 25, 1907) was an American diver who competed in the 1904 Summer Olympics and won the inaugural platform diving competition. Sheldon was an eye doctor from St. Louis, MO, who had studied at the Barnes Medical College in St. Louis, MO. Through most of his life he had suffered from a weak heart which would eventually result in his death.  In the 1904 Olympics he won the gold medal in platform diving but faced controversy as his victory was contested by the Germans. The German competitors were more like stunt divers which was entertaining but on entry into the water they often landed on their bellies or legs, while the American team concentrated more on the entry rather than fancy diving. It was not until a week later that the Games director James E. Sullivan rejected the protests and declared Sheldon the winner.

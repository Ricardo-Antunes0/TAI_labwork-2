Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky ( ;  ; November 6 [O.S. October 25], 1840 â€“ July 23, 1893) was a Russian composer, pianist, and conductor. He wrote music in a wide range of styles, including the symphonic and chamber music of the classical period, operas, ballets, and choral works. Some of his best-known works are the ballet Swan Lake, the opera Eugene Onegin, and the Nutcracker ballet. Tchaikovsky was honoured by his country with state awards and by major composers of the era with whom he collaborated. In 1880, he received the French Legion of Honour.  Tchaikovsky was born in Votkinsk, a town in Samara Oblast, Russia on November 6 [O.S. October 25], 1840 to a Russian noble family of Polish descent. He studied at the Imperial Academy of Music in Moscow with Anton Rubinstein and Nikolai Rubinstein (his father's brother). There he developed an interest in opera which later led to his composing his first opera, The Queen of Spades (1868), after a successful performance at St Petersburg's Mariinsky Theatre.

Jon Jakobsen Venusinus (c. 1558 – 1608) was a Danish theologian, naturalist and historian.  He was born on the island of Ven as the son of the local pastor, Jakob Jonsen.  The father was transferred to Landskrona in 1563, where Jon Jakobsen assumed the surname Coronensis, which he changed to Venusinus after the island of Ven became widely known due to the observatories built there by Tycho Brahe. He visited the school at Frederiksborg, and later studied in Copenhagen and Rostock. In 1579 David Chytræus recommended him to Frederick II, who granted him an annuity to support his studies. Venusinus spent some years travelling in Europe, visiting Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy, and completed a master's degree in Wittenberg. Returning to Denmark, he was made parish priest in Herfølge and Sædder and dean of Bjæverskov Herred in 1584, a position in which he was succeeded by Claus Christoffersen Lyschander in 1587. Venusinus married  Agathe, the daughter of professor John Sascerides  in 1585, and after the death of his first wife in 1589 he married Karine Dankertsdatter, widow of canon Hans Leiel in Roskilde. It appears that both marriages remained childless, but he adopted the son of his second wife, Dankert Leiel.

David Deron Haye (born 13 October 1980) is an English professional boxer who held the WBA world heavyweight title from 2014 to 2015.  Born and raised in London, Haye started boxing at the age of 12. He turned professional in 2000 and won his first 13 fights, with 11 by knockout. He was then narrowly defeated by Vitali Klitschko in a highly anticipated fight for the WBA world heavyweight title in October 2011. Klitschko retired after the fight.  Haye then won eleven consecutive fights, including a victory over WBC world heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder in March 2015. Haye's victory over Wilder gave him the WBA, IBF, and WBO world heavyweight titles. After winning a unanimous decision over Tony Bellew in a rematch for the WBA world heavyweight title on 1 June 2015, Haye vacated his WBO title to focus on defending his IBF and WBA titles.  On 31 May 2016, Haye defeated former heavyweight champion Ruslan Chagaev by majority decision to win the IBF International Heavyweight Title. On 9 November 2017, Haye lost his IBF International Heavyweight Title to Anthony Joshua by TKO in the 12th round of their fight at Wembley Stadium in London.

The Gyumri massacre was a mass murder of seven members of the Armenian Avetisyan family in Gyumri, Armenia, on January 12, 2015. The suspect, Valery Permyakov, a Russian serviceman from the Russian 102nd Military Base, was apprehended by the Armenia-based Russian Border Guards near the border with Turkey and brought into custody at the Gyumri base for further investigation under the Russian jurisdiction. Spontaneous demonstrations in Gyumri and Yerevan ensued, demanding that Permyakov be tried and serve his sentence in Armenia. Perceived inadequate government response further triggered public outrage in Armenia in early 2015 following the incident. In August 2016, Permyakov was sentenced to life on charges of murder by an Armenian court; the court's ruling was upheld in December 2016 by the Appeals Court in Yerevan. Background The existence of a Russian military base in Armenia is controversial. Those in its favor argue that it would force Russia to fight alongside Armenia in the case of a possible Turkish invasion, while critics argue that its existence threatens Armenia's sovereignty and it is dangerous for civilians.

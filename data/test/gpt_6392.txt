Grunwald  is a part of the city of Poznań, in western Poland. It is situated on the right bank of the Warta River, opposite the municipal district of Praga Południe.  The name of Grunwald derives from the Slavic word "grož", meaning "forest" or "woodland". The settlement was first mentioned in a 12th-century deed issued by Bolesław I the Brave. It was initially a small village within the jurisdiction of the Benedictine abbey in Poznań.  In 1311, King Władysław II Jagiełło purchased the village from the monastery, and it became a town under his rule. In 1370, it was given to Matthias Corvinus, who made it his residence and founded a Franciscan convent here. Grunwald prospered as a trading center and became one of the most important towns in Lesser Poland.   In 1569, during the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth period, Grunwald was captured by the forces of Francis II Rakoczi and burned to the ground. It was rebuilt and regained its former importance in trade and commerce. The town's prosperity continued into the 18th century, when it had a population of about 2,000 people. However, its heyday came to an end in 1772, when a fire destroyed much of its wooden architecture.   The town declined rapidly thereafter

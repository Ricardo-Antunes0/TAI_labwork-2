Arbanitis robertsi is a species of tube spider in the family Idiopidae found in and near rainforests in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. A mid to large sized spider which builds a tube of web that extends from the burrow. The tube is attached to rocks, tree ferns or the base of trees. Thousands of these tubes were recorded by Sid Jackson in November 1922 at the south eastern end of Wallis Lake. "Up to three feet long, and half an inch wide". Situated on damp ground, close to freshwater streams. Description Body length of the female is 27mm, male 17 mm. The male a darker brown colour and with longer legs than the female. The burrow is usually straight, or slightly inclined with no brood shaft. The burrow usually extends around 30 cm underground. The tube above ground is usually seen around 15 to 20 cm above ground level. The tube is loosely connected to the burrow at ground level, and pulling the tube breaks it above ground and leaves the spider safe underground.

Vengeance is a 1984 book by George Orwell. It is the last book of the dystopia novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. The book tells the story of Winston Smith, a member of the Outer Party who is forced to work in the Ministry of Truth. Smith gradually realizes that the Party's version of reality is nothing like the real world, and that he and his fellow citizens are being systematically enslaved. In a final act of defiance, Smith destroys the Ministry of Truth and escapes to freedom.  Vengeance was published two years after Orwell's death, and it is often seen as his most personal book. It is written in a straightforward, unadorned style, and it is largely devoid of literary devices. The novel is largely set in a London subway station and features extensively character portraits and scenes from everyday life.

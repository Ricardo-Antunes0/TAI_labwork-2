Qvarqvare III Jaqeli  (1469â€“1535) was a King of Albania. He was the son of King George Kastrioti III and his first wife, Jelena. He succeeded his father in 1478 and reigned until his death.  Qvarqvare was a capable monarch and successfully defended Albania against external threats, most notably from the Ottoman Empire. He also strengthened ties with other European powers, particularly Hungary and Venice. However, Qvarqvare's reign was marred by internal strife and economic difficulties. He died in 1535 after a long and illness-ridden reign and was succeeded by his son, Zhaneris II.

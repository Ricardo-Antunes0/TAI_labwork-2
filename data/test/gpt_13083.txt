7HD is an Australian television channel, owned by the Seven Network. As of February 2015, the channel broadcasts Australian content 24 hours a day.  7HD launched on 26 February 2015 as an Australian version of NBCUniversal's Spanish-language network Telemundo. It replaced Nine Network's Gem TV service, which ceased broadcasting on 31 December 2014.  The Seven Network announced their intent to launch a Spanish-language channel in late 2014, with NBCUniversal signing a deal to provide programming for the channel. The channel was initially expected to launch in early 2015, but was later delayed until February 2015. The channel is available on Foxtel and Austar, and is also available online and through the Seven Network's app.  7HD broadcasts a mix of network programming, telenovelas, reality shows and movies from Telemundo International.

The village used to have paddy fields, pineapples, Mango groves, Jack fruit trees and some native fruit bearing trees unique to the area. But lately Rubber is rapidly becoming the cash crop of choice. The people whose principal occupation was farming have changed in recent years. The second generation after independence have been educated. They work in different parts of the country and overseas. The families get together on occasions of festivities for a bonding.

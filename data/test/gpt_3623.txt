The Battle of Alhandic , also known as the Battle of Al-Handal, was a battle fought by the Byzantine army under Emperor Heraclius against the Sassanid army under Shahrbaraz in 628.  The battle resulted in a decisive Byzantine victory, which prevented a Sassanid invasion of Anatolia and preserved Byzantine control over Syria. The battle is also notable for being the first time that an imperial Roman army had defeated a Sassanid army in open combat.

Prima scriptura is the Christian doctrine that the Bible is the only infallible source of religious teachings. It is also the basis for the doctrine of sola scriptura, or the belief that scripture is the only infallible source of Christian faith.  Prima scriptura is based on two principles: that the Bible is authoritative and that it is the only source of religious teaching. The first principle is based on the principle of divine inspiration, which states that God has directly inspired the writers of scripture. The second principle is based on sola scriptura, or the belief that scripture alone is sufficient to guide believers in their spiritual lives.

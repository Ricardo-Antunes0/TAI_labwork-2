Handstyle or hand style is a term used in modern jazz to describe the improvisational soloing of jazz musicians. It can be contrasted with chordal style, which is the improvisational soloing of rock, blues and country musicians.  The term was first used in the 1940s by jazz critic Leonard Feather to describe the improvisational solos of saxophonist Charlie Parker. Feather coined the term "handstyle" to differentiate it from "chordal style", which he felt was more characteristic of classical and European jazz. He argued that handstyle was more creative and spontaneous, and that it was the signature sound of Parker's saxophone playing.  Since its inception, handstyle has been a central component of jazz improvisation. Jazz musicians frequently use handstyle to explore new harmonic concepts and to create expressive solos. They may also use handstyle to create a unique sound on their instrument.  Handstyle is often improvised spontaneously without any pre-planned notes or chords. This allows jazz musicians to explore new harmonic concepts and to create unique solos.

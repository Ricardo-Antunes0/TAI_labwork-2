Ligier Richier (c. 1500–1567) was a French painter, sculptor and tapestry designer.  Richier was born in Lyon in 1500, the son of a goldsmith. He learned his art from his father and later from Jacques Bellange, a Lyon painter. He went to Rome in 1525, where he worked with Federico Zuccari and Michelangelo. He returned to Lyon in 1533 and became head of the Lyon School of Painting. He died in 1567.  Richier's work is characterised by its realism and naturalism, and his paintings are noted for their technique and craftsmanship. His most famous works include the "Moses" (1534–35) for the Church of Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, the "Virgin and Child" (1535–36) for the Church of St-Julien de Montmartre, and the "Assumption of the Virgin" (1538) for the Church of Notre Dame de Fourvière.

Reviews Julia Cooper reviewed Poison Shy for the Toronto Review of Books, concluding that the book "...attempts an existential mapping of desire and revulsion. If it does not quite succeed as a portrait of the modern day Kafkaesque, it nonetheless reminds us of the uglier faces of desire and the painful process of self-transformation." Writing in the National Post, Nicole Dixon gave the book a mixed review, criticizing Madden for his "precious writing" and concluding that the main character's "...awkwardly described encounters with his Dream Girl, his utter passivity and the story’s thin plot are not enough to tempt readers beyond Poison Shy’s first base."

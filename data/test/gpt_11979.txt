Junipero Serra Peak is the highest mountain peak in the state of California, United States. The peak is located in the Sierra Nevada range, about east-northeast of Yosemite National Park and about south-southeast of Lake Tahoe.  The peak is within the Junipero Serra National Monument, and is part of the larger Sequoia National Park. The mountain is named for Jun√≠pero Serra, a Spanish missionary and explorer who was instrumental in the establishment of California's missions in the late 18th century. Serra Peak is one of California's most popular climbing destinations, owing both to its high altitude and its challenging routes. The mountain is well known for its extensive backcountry skiing and snowboarding terrain, making it a popular destination for winter recreationists.  The summit of Junipero Serra Peak is above sea level. The peak's east face rises abruptly from the heavily wooded floor of Kings Canyon National Park, while the west face slopes gradually from the densely forested Sierra Nevada foothills. The summit area occupies only a small fraction of the mountain's total area; most of the mountain is blanketed by dense forest.  The first recorded ascent of Junipero Serra Peak was made by John C. Fremont and his men on October 10, 1847.

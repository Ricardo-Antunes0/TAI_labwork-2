Anitra Necole "Nikki" Blue (born March 29, 1984) is an American professional basketball player with the New York Liberty of the WNBA and an assistant coach for Cal State Bakersfield. High school Born and raised in Bakersfield, California, Blue played her high school career at West High School.  Blue set the CIF Central Section record for points scored in a single season (913 in the 2000–01 season) and career (2,934 points).  Blue averaged 29 points per game her senior year at West and lead Kern County in assist per game as well.  Blue is regarded as the best player to ever come out of the CIF Central Section.  However, due to the lack of talent around her, West High never won a section championship during Blue's career.  The closest West came was in 2002 when West lost to crosstown rival Stockdale 82–55 in the CIF Central Section Division II championship game. Blue was named a WBCA All-American. She participated in the 2001 WBCA High School All-America Game, where she scored two points.

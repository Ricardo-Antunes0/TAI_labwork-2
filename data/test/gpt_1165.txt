The section principal in an orchestra, as well as the related term principal cello, principal violin, etc., are used to refer to the highest-ranking musician in an ensemble. This person is usually the leader of the orchestra or a designated soloist and is responsible for directing the performance of the ensemble.  In classical music, a principal role is typically one of the most important and prestigious positions in an orchestra. The principal cellist, for example, is generally in charge of playing all of the cello parts in an orchestral work, and the principal violinist generally plays all of the violin parts. The principal conductor is also typically in charge of leading a symphony or other large ensemble, and may be assisted by a deputy conductor.

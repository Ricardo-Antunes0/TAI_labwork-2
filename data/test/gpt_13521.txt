Eleazar Wheelock (April 22, 1711 – April 24, 1784) was an American Congregationalist minister, educator, and scientist. He is best known for his work in New England as a teacher, pastor, and founder of Dartmouth College.  Wheelock was born in Hadley, Massachusetts, to David and Sarah Wheelock. He was the sixth of eight children. Wheelock's father was a noted theologian and minister who served in various churches in Hadley and Northampton. Eleazar began his formal education at the age of eleven, when he entered Phillips Exeter Academy. He then moved to Andover Theological Seminary where he studied under Jonathan Edwards and continued his education until he was twenty-one years old.   In 1737, Wheelock was called to serve as the minister of Congregationalist church in West Bridgewater, Massachusetts. He remained there until 1741, when he was appointed the first pastor of the newly founded First Church in Boston, a post which he held for the next twenty-four years. During this time, Wheelock also served as a tutor at Harvard College, where he taught natural science courses alongside John Winthrop.   In 1768, Wheelock resigned from his pastorate to become the president of Dartmouth College. He served in this role until his death in 1784. Wheelock is buried at Dartmouth's Old South Cemetery.

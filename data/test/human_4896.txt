Thomas Whittle (1683â€“1736) was a Tyneside, England, poet/songwriter, artist and eccentric spanning the late 17th to early 18th centuries. Early life  Thomas Whittle appeared at Cambo around 1700 riding on an old goat.  It was suggested by Thomas Allan in his book Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings that he could have been born at Long Edlingham, Ovingham or Shilbottle, and that his brother was the parish clerk at Earsdon in 1750. In fact, his name may have been originally spelt "Whittel". It has been suggested  that he was christened at Kirkwhelpington on 10 September 1683.   He was employed by an old miller, for whom he worked for years. He became, according to William Brockie quoting from Mackenzie's Northumberland (published 1825), and Thomas Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings, a disciple of "Bacchus", the Greek god of wine (Roman = Dionysus) and remained so for the rest of his life.

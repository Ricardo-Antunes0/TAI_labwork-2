Akkaraipattu (Tamil: அக்கரைப்பற்று, Sinhala: අක්කරපත්තුව) is a large town in the Ampara District, Eastern Province, Sri Lanka.  The town is strategically located with links via the Siyambalanduwa-Ampara Road (A25) and the Colombo-Batticaloa highway (A4). Akkaraipattu is situated  from Colombo. History During the period of British rule, Akkaraipattu was within the Batticaloa District. A Government Agent headed each district. The posts of Maniyakkara (Assistant Government Agent) and Vanniyanar (Additional Government Agent) reported to the Government Agent.. The Vanniyanar appointed two officers directly responsible for irrigation, development, and education. Under this structure, agriculture and road construction became a prominent part of the development of the Akkaraipattu area. The Vanniyanar was also responsible for appointing the chairman and members of local government organizations who would then conduct the functions of a local council including collecting taxes, civic construction, and maintaining law and order. The construction of the Gal Oya scheme, which commenced in 1949 and continues to be improved upon, further established agriculture—particularly paddy and sugar cane—as a driving economic force. Road development also continued in parallel with the development of land for agriculture.

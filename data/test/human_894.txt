The Honda CR250R was a Honda racing dirt bike. The prototype was built in 1971, but it was not until late 1972 that production of the 1973 model "out of the box racers" began sale to the general public. The CR250 was produced for nearly 37 years, 2007 being the final year of production. In 1997, Honda produced an industry first, an aluminum chassis for a motocross motorcycle. These 'first gen' frames were thick, rigid, and were a big change from the previous steel frames, where flexibility had been seen as a problem in the early years. The 1997-8 engines were equipped with a new stator, which supplied DC voltage for the new Keihin carburetor with an electronic 'Power Jet' system, in efforts to control lean mixture preignition. Included in the new electrics was a capacitor and a rectifier/regulator. The 1999 model was almost identical but the Power Jet had disappeared.

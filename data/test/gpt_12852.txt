She is the daughter of Prajāpati, the primordial creator, and is associated with sovereignty, magic, and dreams.   Bhānumati is often depicted as a beautiful woman with long black hair, wearing a crown and holding a snakeskin staff. She is also associated with the moon, and her worship is believed to promote sleep and alleviate nightmares. Her temples are scattered throughout India, Nepal, and Bangladesh, and she is considered one of the most important goddesses in Hinduism.

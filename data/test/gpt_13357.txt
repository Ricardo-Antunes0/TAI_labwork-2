Lai Hu'er, courtesy name Chongshan, titled Duke of Qin, was a Chinese warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He played an important role in the downfall of the dynasty and the rise of the state of Cao Wei.  Lai Hu'er was born in around 125 BC into the Lai family of southern Shandong. He rose to prominence during the reign of Emperor Wu (140-87 BC). In 137 BC, he was made the military governor of Yan Province, while still only in his twenties. In 134 BC he was transferred to command the defence of Jing Province against a possible invasion by the Xiongnu. In 132 BC, he led an army against the Gongsun Clan and captured their capital, Xiapi.  In 131 BC, Lai Hu'er led a rebellion against Emperor Wu. He gained the support of various regional warlords and established himself as the leader of a new state, known as the State of Qin. He ruled Qin until his death in 127 BC.  Lai Hu'er is best known for his role in the downfall of Emperor Wu and the rise of Cao Wei. In 126 BC, Emperor Wu launched an attack on Lai Hu'er's State of Qin, hoping to bring him to heel and end his rebellion. However, Lai Hu'er proved to be a formidable adversary and managed to hold off all attacks for over two years. In 125 BC, he inflicted a decisive defeat on Emperor Wu's forces at the Battle of Tong Pass

Ella Mundhenke Russell (c. 1868 â€“ March 9, 1965) was an American suffragist, civil rights activist, and labor organizer. She was a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and served as its first president from 1909 to 1911.  Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, Ella Mundhenke Russell became involved in activism early in her life. She worked with her mother to help organize a local black school, and at the age of 16, she helped found the Springfield branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).  In 1909, Russell was elected president of the NAACP, and during her tenure, she worked to improve race relations and gain equal rights for African Americans. She also organized protests against racial segregation and discrimination, and helped to expand the association's reach into other areas of civil rights activism.  Ella Mundhenke Russell retired from active leadership of the NAACP in 1951, but she continued to work on behalf of civil rights until her death in 1965. She has been recognized as an important figure in American history, and her work has been commemorated with a number of awards and memorials.

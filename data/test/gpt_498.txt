Carmen Get It! is a Tom and Jerry cartoon short released on October 1, 1943. It was written by Michael Maltese and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera.  The cartoon is a remake of the 1921 short "Tom and Jerry at the Zoo", with new characters created for the 1943 version. The new characters are Carmen, a vixen who is Tom's love interest, and Jerry, a jaguar who is Carmen's love interest.  The cartoon is notable for its musical number, "Puttin' On The Ritz", in which Tom and Jerry put on an elaborate show for Carmen.

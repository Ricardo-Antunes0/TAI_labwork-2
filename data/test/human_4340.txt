The Paps of Anu (, "the breasts of Anu") are a pair of breast shaped mountains near Killarney in County Kerry, Ireland.  The eastern summit, The Paps East, is  high and the western top, The Paps West is  high. The mountains are named after Anu; believed to have been an ancient mother goddess. Cormac's Glossary describes Anu or Danu as "the mother of the gods of Ireland". On each summit is a prehistoric cairn, which may be miniature passage graves or house burial cists. The cairn on the eastern Pap is slightly larger, with a height of  and diameter of . They have been described as "stone nipples on the great breasts of the mother goddess". A line of stones, known as Na Fiacla, connects the two tops and is believed to have been a processional route. Archeologist Frank Coyne suggested that the mountains were seen as sacred and said "There is little doubt that the mountaintops of both The Papsâ€¦were utilized for ritual in prehistory". To the ancients, the mountains reinforced the idea that the Earth was a motherly body.

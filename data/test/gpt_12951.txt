In a first-past-the-post electoral system (FPTP); formally, the voting method of single member districts, each elector votes for a single candidate, who then receives all of the votes cast. The candidate with the most votes wins the seat.  FPTP has been used in many countries around the world, including in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, India, and the United States. It is also used in some states in Mexico. In China, it is used for provincial level elections.  There are two main criticisms of FPTP: that it leads to parties and candidates with a majority of seats being from the same region or faction (resulting in gridlock), and that it can produce inaccurate results because it does not take into account the number of votes a candidate receives compared to their opponent (leading to hung parliaments).

The Politics of Eritrea and the Government of President Isaias Afewerki have been the focus of intense international scrutiny since Eritrea became an independent nation in 1993. Afewerki has been the president of Eritrea since then and has been widely considered to be one of the most powerful men in the world. The country is a one-party state with Afewerki's People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) as the only legal party. The PFDJ was founded in 1991 and has been the sole ruling party ever since. The country is ranked as a low-income country by the World Bank.   Eritrea has been plagued by political instability and sporadic armed conflict since independence. The country has been in a state of emergency since 2001, which has been extended multiple times. The most recent extension was in 2017. The country also suffers from high levels of poverty and malnutrition, as well as significant gender inequality. There have been several attempted coups d'Ã©tat against Afewerki over the years, most notably in 1997 and 2001.

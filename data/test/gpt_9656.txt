The nitrogen solubility index (NSI) is a measure of the dissolved nitrogen content of a substance. The NSI is calculated as the product of the weight of nitrogen atom per unit volume and the specific gravity of the substance. The higher the NSI, the more soluble the substance is in water.  The NSI can be used as a measure of the water-soluble content of a substance, and can be used to determine the relative solubility of different nitrogen-containing compounds in water. The NSI is also a useful tool for predicting the stability of nitrogen-containing compounds in water systems.

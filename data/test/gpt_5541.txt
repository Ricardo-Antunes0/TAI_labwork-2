Ullevi, sometimes known as Nya Ullevi (, "New Ullevi") is an all-seater football stadium located in Gothenburg, Sweden. It is the home ground of Göteborgs FF and the national football team of Sweden. The stadium has a capacity of 27,000 people and was opened in 1958.  Ullevi was originally built as a rugby ground and was known as Nya Råsunda (, "New Rugby Grounds"). It was used by Göteborgs FF during the 1930s. The football club moved to Ullevi in 1958 and the stadium was renamed Ullevi. In 1975, Ullevi hosted the final of the UEFA European Football Championship which saw Netherlands beat Denmark 1-0. It also hosted two matches at the 1978 FIFA World Cup.  Ullevi was renovated in 2003 and 2004, costing SEK200 million. The project included the installation of a new roof and partially new terracing.

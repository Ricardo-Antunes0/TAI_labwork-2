Another Joe was a punk rock band from the early 1980s, active in the Los Angeles area. Formed in 1979, they were one of the earliest hardcore punk bands to emerge from Southern California.  Another Joe was initially a backing band for another L.A.-area punk outfit, The Dead Kennedys. After the release of the group's debut album, 1981's "Another Joe", they began issuing their own material, eventually issuing three more albums before splitting up in 1986.   Since their breakup, several former members of Another Joe have gone on to successful solo careers.

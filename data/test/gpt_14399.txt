Al-Sinnabra or Sinn en-Nabra, is the Arabic word for "the fish".  The name Sinnabra is derived from the Arabic word Sinn, meaning "fish" and Nabra, meaning "nipple". The name first appeared in an inscription on a silver dish found at Qarqar in Syria in the early 1st century AD.  The ancient city of Sinnabra was located on the Tigris River about 25 km east of modern Baghdad. The excavations at Sinnabra have yielded evidence of occupation dating back to the Early Bronze Age (c. 3000-2000 BC). It was a major trading center on the Euphrates River and was known for its ironworking.

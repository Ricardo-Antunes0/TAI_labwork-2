Subiaco Oval (; nicknamed Subi) was a sports stadium in Perth, Western Australia, located in the suburb of Subiaco. It was opened in 1908 and closed in 2017 after the completion of the new Perth Stadium in Burswood. Subiaco Oval was the highest capacity stadium in Western Australia and one of the main stadiums in Australia, with a final capacity of 43,500 people. It began as the home ground for the Subiaco Football Club and from the 1930s onward was the home of Australian rules football in Western Australia. It hosted the annual grand final of the West Australian Football League (WAFL), with the ground record attendance of 52,781 set at the 1979 Grand Final. It later served as the home ground of the West Coast Eagles and the Fremantle Football Club, the two Perth teams in the Australian Football League (AFL). Other events included Socceroos International Friendly Game in 2005, Perth Glory soccer games (including two National Soccer League grand finals), Western Force rugby games, International rules football matches, and rock concerts. Under naming rights the stadium was known as Patersons Stadium (2011–2014) and Domain Stadium (2015–2017) in its final years.

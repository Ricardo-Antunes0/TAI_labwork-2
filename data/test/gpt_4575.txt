Purmerend  is a city and municipality in the Netherlands. It is located in the province of North Holland. The municipality had a population of 156,654 on 1 January 2017.  Purmerend was founded in the early 17th century as a small fishing village on the banks of the Vecht River by Pieter Claeszoon Berkhout and his wife Aeltje Jansdr. They named the village after Purmerend Castle in Flanders, the home of their patron, the Count of Berkhout. Purmerend grew rapidly due to its favourable location – at the confluence of two major waterways (the Vecht and IJ) – and because it served as a stopover for traders travelling between Amsterdam and the Baltic Sea. The earliest record of a church in Purmerend dates from 1624.  Today, Purmerend is a prosperous city with a strong cultural identity. Its landmarks include Purmerend Castle (a 17th-century country house), the Purmerendse Schouwburg (a 19th-century theatre), and the Purmerendse Binnenweg (a major arterial road). Many well-known Dutch people – including writers Anne Frank and Joop Ter Heijden – were born in or have lived in Purmerend.

Lake Warren was a proglacial lake that formed in the Lake Erie basin around 12,700 years before present (YBP) when Lake Whittlesey dropped in elevation. Lake Warren is divided into three stages: Warren I , Warren II , and Warren III , each defined by the relative elevation above sea level. Origin Lake Warren followed Lake Wayne.  It covered the basin of Lake Erie, part of Lake Huron, including Saginaw Bay and the lowland, which separates Lake Huron from Lake Erie. It included a part of the Lake Ontario basin and the lowland between Lakes Ontario and Erie.  Lake Warren included the Saginaw basin and the Huron-Erie basin.  Its outlet was through the Grand River to Lake Chicago. The beach stands at  above sea level west of the hinge line, unaffected by the isostatic rebound.  It is marginally above the outlet, at . Lake Warren was preceded by a lower stage, which had its outlet through the Mohawk valley. Lake Warren came into existence its waters were raised from Lake Wayne by advancing ice front.  The ice both compacted the area where the melt water could be held, raising the water level, while blocking the lower outlet from Lake Wayne.

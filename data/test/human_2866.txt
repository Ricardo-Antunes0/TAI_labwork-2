Janine Boyd (born February 5, 1971) is the Representative of the 9th district of the Ohio House of Representatives. She is the daughter of Barbara Boyd, who held the same seat from 1993 to 2000 and from 2007 to 2014.  Boyd previously served on council for Cleveland Heights, where she often faced criticism for her attendance. In 2012, she was appointed to council to replace Phyllis Evans. In 2014, she announced that she would seek to replace her mother, Barbara Boyd, in the Ohio House of Representatives. She faced Republican Charles Hopson in the general election, and went on to win 85%-15%. During debate on an Ohio "heartbeat bill" banning abortion after detection of a fetal heartbeat, Boyd drafted an amendment that would give an exemption to African American women, "whose history includes rape and forced birth imposed on enslaved women and black women after slavery". The amendment failed, and the bill was signed into law. A federal judge issued an injunction against the bill before it took effect.

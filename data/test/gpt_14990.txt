Casa Buonarroti is a museum in Florence, Italy, containing a significant collection of art and artifacts from the Renaissance period.  The villa was commissioned by Cosimo de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, in 1559, from the architect Michelangelo Buonarroti. It was later acquired by the Buonarroti family. The museum was founded in 1889 by Countess Lotta Bentivoglio.   The main collection contains works of art from the 14th to the 16th centuries, including paintings by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Donatello, as well as sculptures by Donatello, Lorenzo Ghiberti, and Arrigo di Cambio.

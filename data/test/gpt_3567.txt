The Cima Vallona ambush (Italian: Strage di Cima Vallona) was a military ambush carried out by the Italian Army on 11 July 1944, during World War II. It resulted in the deaths of 25 soldiers of the United States 101st Airborne Division, and is considered one of the most devastating defeats in the division's history.  The 101st Airborne Division was based in England at the time and was preparing to cross the Normandy landing beaches on D-Day. On 10 July, they were ordered to move to a new location, and while en route, they were ambushed by German forces near Cima Vallona. The surprise attack resulted in a slaughter of the American troops, with 25 killed and 73 wounded. The defeat caused great concern in Allied command, as it showed that the Germans still had a strong presence in Normandy.

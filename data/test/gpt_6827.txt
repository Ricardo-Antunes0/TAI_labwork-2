Mauro Alice (1925 – 23 November 2010) was an Italian artist and sculptor. He was born in Barga, Tuscany.  Alice's early life was spent painting and drawing in Barga and Florence. In 1949, he moved to Rome to study at the Accademia di Belle Arti e Design under Giorgio De Chirico, but he soon left to pursue a career as an artist.  Alice's sculptures often incorporate elements of the natural world, and often feature animal or human figures that are both expressive and surrealistic in appearance. Many of his works are housed in public institutions throughout Italy, including the Museo Nazionale d'Arte Antica in Rome, the Museo della Civiltà Romana in Palazzo Massimo alle Terme in Rome, and the Galleria d'arte Moderna in Naples.  Alice died on 23 November 2010 at the age of 86 after a long illness.

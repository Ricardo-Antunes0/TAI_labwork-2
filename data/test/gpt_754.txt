William Keith Kellogg (April 7, 1860 â€“ November 3, 1943) was an American chemist and inventor who is best known for his role in developing the cereal Kellogg's corn flakes.  Kellogg was born in Battle Creek, Michigan, to John Kellogg and Priscilla Rice. He had two sisters and a brother. In 1876, Kellogg graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in chemistry. He then moved to Chicago to work as a chemist for the food company United States Refining and Producing Company.  In 1888, Kellogg invented the cornflake at the suggestion of his friend and business partner Will Keith Cooke. The cornflake was initially marketed as an alternative to bread because it was lightweight and easy to transport. By 1895, Kellogg's Corn Flakes were being sold nationwide. The company that he founded, the W. K. Kellogg Company, remains one of the world's largest food companies.  Kellogg was a prolific inventor and held over 150 patents in his lifetime. Some of his other notable inventions include the cake mix, cereal bar, Froot Loops, and Pop-Tarts. He was also a major philanthropist, donating millions of dollars to charities throughout his life. In 1943, Kellogg died at the age of 90 after a long battle with arthritis.

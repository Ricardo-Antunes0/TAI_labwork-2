Curacao (pronounced Koo-ra-sao), formerly La Curacao, is a Dutch island in the eastern Caribbean Sea. It has an area of 110 square kilometers (42 sq mi) and a population of 31,000 (2002 estimate). The capital is Willemstad.  Curacao was uninhabited until the late 16th century when it was settled by the Spanish. The island became a Dutch possession in 1633 and was named Curacao after the Carib word for tortoise. By the early 18th century, Curacao had become a major sugar producer, and it remained so until the late 19th century. Curacao became a colony of the Netherlands in 1898. In 1954, the island's status changed to that of a province of the Netherlands Antilles.  The economy of Curacao is now based largely on tourism and finance. The island has a number of luxury hotels and resorts, including The Ritz-Carlton Curacao, which is one of the world's most famous hotels. Curacao also has a number of casinos, including two owned by Hollywood star Steve Wynn.

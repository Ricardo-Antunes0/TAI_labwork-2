A famiclone is a colloquial name given to a handheld console system that combines the features of a dedicated game console and a portable media player. Famiclones typically have weaker graphics and sound quality than dedicated game consoles, but offer the convenience of portability and the ability to play games off of optical discs, as well as downloaded games from the internet. Some famiclones also allow users to watch movies and television shows.

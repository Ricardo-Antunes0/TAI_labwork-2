Baroque music ( or ) is a style of European classical music that emerged in the 17th century. The baroque period is generally considered to begin with the establishment of the Royal Academy of Music in London in 1660 and to end with the death of Bach in 1750.  The baroque period saw a dramatic increase in compositional activity, with more than double the amount of music written compared to the previous century. This was partly due to a new wave of creativity that spread through Europe from Italy, brought about by the arrival of many talented musicians from that country. The baroque period also saw an increase in the number of virtuoso performers, as musicians began to specialize in specific areas such as keyboard playing or voice.  Baroque music is characterized by its elaborate and ornate style, its use of dramatic devices such as repetition and variation, and its frequent use of counterpoint. The baroque period saw the development of complex musical form, including ternary and binary form. Baroque music also saw the emergence of influential composers such as Antonio Vivaldi, George Frideric Handel, and J.S. Bach.

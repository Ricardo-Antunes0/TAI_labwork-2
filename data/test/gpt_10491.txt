The Pemberton-Billing P.B.25 was a First World War fighter aircraft designed and built by the Englishman Geoffrey Pemberton and the Canadian Arthur Billing.  The Pemberton-Billing P.B.25 was an asymmetric design featuring a single, centrally mounted engine in a nacelle behind the cockpit. The engine was cooled by a large radiators mounted on the wings, giving the aircraft good performance at high altitude. The aircraft was armed with four machine guns and could carry a payload of up to 1,000 kilograms (2,200 lb).  The Pemberton-Billing P.B.25 first flew in July 1917, but due to problems with the engines it did not enter service with the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) until February 1918. The Pemberton-Billing P.B.25 proved to be a successful fighter aircraft, being credited with shooting down 14 enemy aircraft during its operational career. However, due to its poor performance at low altitude the Pemberton-Billing P.B.25 was never used in combat against German fighters.

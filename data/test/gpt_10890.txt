The HIV Legal Network (formerly the Canadian AIDS Legal Network) is a national, non-profit organization that provides legal support and representation to people living with HIV/AIDS and their families in Canada.  The HIV Legal Network was founded in 1990 as the Canadian AIDS Legal Network, with the goal of ending the criminalization of people living with HIV/AIDS. The organization has since grown to become one of Canada's leading advocates for people living with HIV/AIDS, working to ensure that they have access to health care, legal support, and social services.  The HIV Legal Network offers a range of legal services to people living with HIV/AIDS and their families, including advice on housing rights, discrimination and hate crimes, health care rights, and refugee status. The organization also works to raise public awareness of the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS, and to provide education and information on HIV/AIDS prevention.  The HIV Legal Network is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, and has offices in Vancouver, Calgary, Montreal, Halifax, Winnipeg, Ottawa, and Edmonton. The organization employs a staff of lawyers and other professionals who provide representation to individuals living with HIV/AIDS across Canada.

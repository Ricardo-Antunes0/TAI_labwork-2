Dendrobium glabrum, commonly known as the creeping orchid, is a species of orchid native to the eastern and southeastern United States. It is a tuberous, perennial herb with a single erect stem reaching up to 1.5 m tall. The leaves are lance-shaped and dull green, the flowers are small and white, and the sepals and petals are fused together to form a hood or tube.  Dendrobium glabrum is found in moist woodlands, along streams and in leaf-litter. It is host to several parasitic nematodes that help it to spread its pollen.

is a city in Japan. It is the capital of the Hokkaidō region and is also the largest city on the island of Hokkaidō.

Its name comes from the Japanese word meaning "place where the sun rises", in reference to the city's geographic location at the eastern edge of the Great North Mountain at the eastern end of Hokkaidō's eastern coast. The early history of Sapporo is closely tied to that of Hokkaido and its tributaries, which were the only route available to bring coal from Kyūshū to Japan until 1898.  The city grew rapidly during the late 19th century as Japan began to take an active role in international diplomacy. In 1876, following the signing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki which ended the Second Sino-Japanese War, Japan annexed all of Korea east of the Soya Strait, including what was then called Erimo Province. This gave Japan a direct connection to markets in East Asia and ultimately led to Japan's rapid industrialization. Sapporo became one of Japan's primary ports for trading with foreigners and became known as "the Paris of East Asia".  Sapporo became an urban center for Japan during the 1930s,

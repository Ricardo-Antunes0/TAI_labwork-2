Eta Carinae (η Carinae, abbreviated to η Car, η Car, η Cas), also known as The Southern Harpy or The Southern Crown, is a spectroscopic binary system in the constellation Carina. It is located about 3,500 light-years from Earth.  Eta Carinae is one of the most luminous and massive stars in the Milky Way galaxy. The pair are estimated to be about 100 times more massive than the Sun and have a combined luminosity that is about 400,000 times that of the Sun. They are thought to be in the final stages of their stellar evolution and are expected to explode as a supernova within the next million years.

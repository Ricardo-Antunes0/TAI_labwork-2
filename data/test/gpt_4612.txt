Workplace aggression is a specific type of workplace violence that manifests as physical aggression towards colleagues or superiors. It is often characterised by an aggressive or hostile attitude, as well as a desire to dominate or control others.  Workplace aggression can have a negative impact on employees' mental and physical health, as well as their work performance. It can also lead to decreased morale and increased absenteeism. In extreme cases, workplace aggression can lead to violence or even death.  There is no one cause of workplace aggression, but it is often linked to factors such as stress, lack of communication, and a power imbalance in the workplace.  There is no single solution to preventing workplace aggression, but measures such as education and training aimed at improving communication and management skills are often effective.

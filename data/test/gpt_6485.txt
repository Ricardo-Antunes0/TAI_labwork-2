Sixto Escobar (March 23, 1913 â€“ November 9, 1993) was a Colombian drug lord who, at one point, was the world's wealthiest man. He is considered one of the most notorious criminals in history.  Escobar was born in rural Colombia to a poor family. He started working in a bakery at the age of 12 and eventually became a successful businessperson. In the early 1960s, Escobar began importing and selling drugs. His organization became one of the largest drug trafficking networks in the world, smuggling cocaine and other drugs into North America and Europe.  Escobar's wealth and power made him one of the most feared men in the world. In 1986, Escobar was arrested by Colombian authorities and sentenced to life in prison. He was eventually killed in a shootout with police while on the run from prison.

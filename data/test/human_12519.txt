FSC Millport, run by the Field Studies Council, is located on the island of Great Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde, Scotland. The field centre was formerly known as the University Marine Biological Station Millport (UMBSM), a higher education institute run by the University of London in partnership with Glasgow University but was closed due to the withdrawal of higher education funding in 2013. FSC reopened the centre in 2014 and continues to host and teach university, school and college groups and to support and host research students from all over the world, whilst also extending its educational reach and providing a variety of courses in natural history and outdoor environmental activities for adult learners and families to enjoy.  The centre is a very popular conference venue hosting many international events. The Robertson Museum and Aquarium (named after the founder of the original Marine Station, David Robertson) is open to visitors between March and November. The centre also functions as a Meteorological Office Weather Station and Admiralty Tide Monitor. History  The Ark, an 84Â ft lighter originally moored in the flooded Granton quarry, was fitted out as a floating laboratory by the father of modern oceanography, Sir John Murray. This boat was brought to Port Loy on the Isle of Cumbrae in 1885 and formed the beginnings of the Scottish Marine Station. She attracted a stream of distinguished scientists, drawn by the richness of the fauna and flora of the Firth of Clyde, but gradually fell into disuse after the opening of the Millport Marine Station, and on the night of 20 January 1900 was completely destroyed by a great storm.

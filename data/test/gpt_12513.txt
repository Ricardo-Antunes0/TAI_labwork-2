Sighere was the joint king of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Essex and Sussex. He was the son of Æthelberht, king of East Anglia, and his wife Bertha.  Sighere succeeded his father in 788, and ruled jointly with his brother Æthelberht until 794. In 796 he was defeated by Offa of Mercia and forced to flee to East Anglia. He regained control of his kingdom in 802, but died the following year.  Sighere was a devout Christian and is considered to be the founder of the Church of England's bishopric at Winchester. He was also responsible for the foundation of the monasteries at Bury St Edmunds and Sherborne.

Fallsville Splash Park was a water park located in Niagara Falls, New York. It was adjacent to the former Niagara Falls Convention Center. History The park originally opened as Niagara Splash Park on May 29, 1988 as part of a large development in downtown Niagara Falls, NY that also included two entertainment complexes along Old Falls Street and a hotel. Construction cost was $18 million. The park struggled due to poor staffing, lack of advertising and attractions, and a high admission price, and was ordered closed in 1991 by then-Niagara Falls mayor Jake Palillo due to unpaid water bills. The city council voted to take over the park in 1992 and operated it until 1998. The park again closed and remained dormant until 2005, when it was reacquired by the original operators and received $4 million in renovations, including repair of damage caused by vandals while the park sat dormant. The park never turned a profit.

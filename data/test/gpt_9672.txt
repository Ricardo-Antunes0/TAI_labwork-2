The Savannah Region is a newly proposed region of the United States. The region would be made up of parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas.  The Savannah Region would be named after the Savannah River, which runs through it. The region is intended to help strengthen ties between the states by promoting trade and cooperation. The region is also hoped to help reduce economic inequality between the states.

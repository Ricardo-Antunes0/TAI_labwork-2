In military strategy, a choke point (or choke point system) is a location on a battlefield where an enemy's line of supply is effectively blocked. From then the defenders can starve the enemy of resources, making it more difficult for them to sustain combat.  A choke point can be physical, such as a bridge or road over a river, or it can be a strategic location such as an airfield or port.

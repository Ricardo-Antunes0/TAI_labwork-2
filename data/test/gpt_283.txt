Pro-Búsqueda is a nongovernmental organization from El Salvador focused on the promotion of freedom of information.  Pro-Búsqueda was founded in 1997 by journalists, lawyers and human rights activists as a response to the government's increasing restrictions on freedom of information. The organization has since worked to promote freedom of information policies and practices, lobby for change at national and international levels, and support individual journalists and activists who face challenges accessing information.  Since its inception, Pro-Búsqueda has played a key role in advocating for the protection of freedom of information in El Salvador, championing cases that have led to judicial rulings in favor of freedom of information. In 2012, Pro-Búsqueda won the prestigious United Nations Freedom of Information Award for its work on protecting freedom of information in El Salvador.

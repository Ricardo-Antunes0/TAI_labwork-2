R v Buhay [2003] 1 S.C.R. 631, is a criminal law case in which the Supreme Court of Canada held that a search conducted without prior judicial authorization is not constitutional.  The case concerns the search of a bus after it had been detained for a traffic stop. The driver and four passengers were arrested for drug trafficking. The police searched the bus without first obtaining a warrant. The search turned up drugs and weapons.  The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the search was unconstitutional because the police did not have prior judicial authorization to do so. This ruling has been influential in setting standards for when police must obtain a warrant before conducting a search.

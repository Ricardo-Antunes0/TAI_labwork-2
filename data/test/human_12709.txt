Culbertson's Path was a Native American trail in north central Pennsylvania in the United States, which connected the Great Island Path with the Sheshequin Path. The eastern / southern end of the path was on the West Branch Susquehanna River at what is now the village of Allenwood in Gregg Township, Union County. The northern / western end was in Old Lycoming Township just north of what is now the city of Williamsport in Lycoming County. Culbertson's Path followed White Deer Hole Creek west from Allenwood, then left to follow Spring Creek north, crossing North White Deer Ridge and Bald Eagle Mountain and following Mosquito Run to the West Branch Susquehanna River at the modern borough of Duboistown. Here it forded the river at Culbertson's Ripples (approximately the modern location of the Arch Street Bridge). From Allenwood to Spring Creek, Culbertson's Path and the Great Island Path shared the same trail. The Great Island Path led west to Great Island (modern Lock Haven), and paths there led west to the Allegheny River and beyond.

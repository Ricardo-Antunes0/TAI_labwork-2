555 17th Street, formerly known as the Anaconda Tower and the Qwest Tower, is a skyscraper in Denver, Colorado. The building was completed in 1978, and rises 40 floors and  in height. The building stands as the seventh-tallest building in Denver and Colorado. It also stood as the tallest building in the city at the time of its 1978 completion, and held that distinction for three years until it was surpassed by the  707 17th Street in 1981. 555 17th Street was originally known as the Anaconda Tower, after the Anaconda Company who relocated their headquarters from New York City to Denver in 1978. The building became the world headquarters of Qwest in 1997, at which point it was adorned with two large Qwest signs. The building served as Qwest's headquarters until 2000, when the corporation moved to 1801 California Street, the second-tallest building in Denver situated two blocks away. Although Qwest moved its headquarters in 2000, the two brightly lit blue signs on 555 17th Street remained in place for four more years. Qwest finally removed the logos in 2004, but prior to that the signs were left dark for several months.

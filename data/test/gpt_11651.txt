The Mainz-Hessian War of 1427 was the first of three wars fought by the House of Habsburg against the Wittelsbachs.  The war began when Duke Louis IV of Bavaria invaded the Electorate of Mainz, which was ruled by Louis II, Count Palatine of the Rhine. Louis had been promised the Palatinate as part of his inheritance if he succeeded his father in 1392, but the death of Louis II prevented this from happening. Louis IV claimed the Palatinate as his own and marched into it.  The Electorate of Mainz, which was backed by the Wittelsbachs, responded by attacking Louis's possessions in Swabia and Franconia. The war escalated quickly, with both sides mobilizing armies and quickly taking territory from each other. By 1427, both sides had lost most of their original territories and were fighting for control of a small area around Worms.  The House of Habsburg emerged victorious from the war, gaining control over the Palatinate and establishing a strong position in southern Germany. The war also demonstrated the power and reach of the House of Habsburg, which would later become one of the most powerful dynasties in Europe.

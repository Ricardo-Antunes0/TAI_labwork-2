Dewstow House, Caldicot, Monmouthshire, Wales, is an early 18th century country house, now a museum.  Dewstow House is located in the village of Caldicot, about north-west of Monmouth. The house was built in about 1705 for the Wynn family, who were Lords of the manor of Caldicot and later Earls of Erlestoke. The Wynn family were also proprietors of the nearby copper mines. The house was subsequently acquired by the Marquess of Bute, and it is now a museum open to the public.  The architecture of Dewstow House is Venetian in style, with a hipped roof and a Palladian window on the front facade. The interior contains many features typical of 18th century English country houses, including a marble fireplace and carved woodwork. The collection includes items from throughout Bute's life, including paintings, furniture, and coins.

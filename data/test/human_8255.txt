Gameplay  In Atlas, people can create their own pirates, with adjustable settings such as skin color. Before entering, the game gives a choice between a PvE or PvP server, whereas PvP allows the other players to attack at any time. Similar to Ark: Survival Evolved, it is a survival game where the goal is to live as long as possible. There are four vitamin levels to keep up by eating meat, vegetables, fruit and fish. Doing it over the limits gives the players a status effect like blurry screen and decreasing health bar. Besides that, other stats have to be fulfilled, like water needs, which may result in dehydration if that gets ignored. In order to build something, enough resources must be gathered by cutting trees and smashing rocks, which uses up some health. Building a ship is possible by constructing its parts, and filling its reserves with food and weapons. They can be navigated while travelling between the lands.

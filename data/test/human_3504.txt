James Allenby-Kirk or simply James Kirk (born 1988) is a Scottish actor, comedian and writer. He is perhaps best known for his roles as Jeff the Chef in the comedy Gary: Tank Commander and as Stosh in the drama series 24: Live Another Day. Career Born in Paisley, just outside Glasgow, he was educated at Williamsburgh Primary and Paisley Grammar School. He later attended Langside College, studying acting and performance. Kirk made his breakthrough into the comedy circuit by winning the "So You Think You're Funny?" competition in 2010. His first television appearance came in 2010, when he played Malky in Rab C. Nesbitt. He also appeared in Channel 4's "Comedy Blaps" series, in which he wrote and starred in the short online sketches "Kronicles of Kirk."  However, it was in Greg McHugh's BAFTA award winning sitcom Gary: Tank Commander, in which he played Jeff the Chef, that he was brought to the attention of a wider audience.

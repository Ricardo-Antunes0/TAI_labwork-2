Mutayr (; also spelled Mutair, Mutair and Mutaira) is a city in northeastern Syria, administratively part of the Hasakah Governorate. Mutayr is located on the Khabur River, north of Hasakah. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, Mutayr had a population of 25,822 in the 2004 census.  Mutayr is an ancient Arab city that served as the capital of the Mutayr district during the early Islamic period. The city was sacked by the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius in 636 AD, and again by Khalid ibn al-Walid in 669 AD. Mutayr subsequently became a Muslim stronghold and played an important role in the development of Syriac culture. During the Crusades, it was captured by Tancred in 1105 AD and recaptured by Raymond II of Tripoli in 1113 AD. The city was finally lost to the Mongols in 1236 AD.  Mutayr has been identified with Tell Muthanna, which was occupied during the Early Dynastic Period and was later abandoned. Mutayr may have been founded by Mutamri ibn-Numan al-Khurasani, one of the early Islamic prophets.

Aggregates are used in dimensional models of data warehouses to group data items together in a way that is meaningful for analysis. This allows for the retrieval of data items that are associated with certain dimensions, which can be useful for downstream analysis.  A data warehouse is a database that is used to store and analyze data. A dimensional model is a way of organizing data so that it can be easily analyzed.

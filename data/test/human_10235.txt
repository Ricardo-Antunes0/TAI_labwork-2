Two Eleven is the sixth studio album by American recording artist Brandy. Released on October 12, 2012, it served as the singer's debut release with Chameleon Entertainment and RCA Records after departing from Epic Records soon after releasing her previous album, Human (2008). The album's title is taken from Norwood's birthday; it is also the day on which her idol and friend, entertainer Whitney Houston died eight months prior to Two Elevens release. Two Eleven is the first album from Norwood to include a diverse roster of collaborators, including songwriting credits from Frank Ocean, Chris Brown and Sean Garrett. Production comes courtesy of the likes of Bangladesh and Rico Love, amongst others. Upon its release, the album received critical acclaim, with many complimenting Norwood's vocals, the album's production and the overall direction. Two Eleven debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 65,000 copies, becoming Norwood's fourth top-ten album and her first in eight years. It also debuted atop the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, her second album to do so.

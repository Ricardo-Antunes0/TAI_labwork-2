In music, function (also referred to as "functional harmony") is a term used to describe the relationship between musical elements, or chords. The purpose of function can vary, but often it involves enhancing or completing the harmonic scheme of a composition.  Function can be broken down into two categories: structural and contrapuntal. Structural function focuses on the overall structure of a piece, while contrapuntal function focuses on the interaction between chords.   Function can be used in a number of ways to create harmonic effects. One common way is through augmentation, in which one chord is added to another to create a new harmonic effect. Another way is through diminution, in which one chord is reduced in size to create a new harmonic effect.   Function can also be used to change the mood or feeling of a piece. For example, by adding more minor chords to a piece of music that is in a major key, you can create a more somber feeling. Alternatively, by adding more major chords to a piece of music that is in a minor key, you can create a more upbeat feeling.

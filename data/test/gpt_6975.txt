John Rut (fl. 1512 â€“ 1528) was an English cleric and writer.  Born in the parish of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, London, Rut was the son of a prosperous clothier. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was awarded a BA in 1515 and MA in 1519. After leaving Oxford, Rut served as a chaplain to Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey before being appointed Dean of Lincoln in 1526. Rut died in 1528.  Rut is best known for his work "The Boke of St. Albans" (1528), a devotional work written in honor of St. Albans, which is still reprinted and used today. Rut also wrote "A Mirror for Magistrates" (1528), "A Dialogue against the Scholasticall Philosophy" (1529), and "An Apologie for the Bible" (1531).

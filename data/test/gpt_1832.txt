Margaret of Scotland may refer to: Nobility  Margaret of Scotland (c. 1241-1286), was Queen of Scots from 1266 until her death.  She was the eldest daughter of King Alexander III of Scotland and his second wife, Joan of England. Margaret became queen when her father died in 1260, and reigned until her death in 1286. She was the last monarch of the House of Balliol.  During her reign, Margaret attempted to regain control of Scotland from the English Crown, which had gained increasing influence since the reign of her father. For this reason she is sometimes regarded as a key figure in the Scottish independence movement. She was also a patron of learning and founded several universities in Scotland.

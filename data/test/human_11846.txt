The name Ragnhild Sigurdsdotter may refer to two different figures from Old Norse literature, an amalgam of them, or a purely fictitious figure.  The wife of Halfdan the Elder (c. 810 – c. 860)  A woman who lived during the late 9th and/or early 10th centuries, who was the daughter of Sigurd Hart of the Dagling clan, .  While some traditional accounts portray these two figures as the same woman, they (and their relatives) lived in differing periods. Ragnhild, second wife of Halfdan the Elder According to Heimskringla, a Ragnhild Sigurdsdotter was the second wife of Halfdan the Elder. (The first being Ragnhild Haraldsdotter Gulskeg.)  Hake, a berserker encountered her father in Hadeland and killed him, before kidnapping Ragnhild Sigurdsdotter from her home. Halfdan the Elder then had her kidnapped from Hake, so that he could marry her. Fagrskinna does not mention any of these details. However, both sagas agree that Ragnhild and Halfdan The Elder were the parents of Harald Fairhair.

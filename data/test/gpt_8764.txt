Edmund Goodwyn, M.D. (1756â€“1829) was an English physician and anatomist.  Goodwyn was born in 1756 in the town of Brentford, Middlesex, England. He began his medical studies at the University of Edinburgh in 1777, and then moved to London to study at the University of London. He became a doctor in 1785, and began working as an assistant to Dr. John Hunter at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. In 1801, he became the first professor of pathology and medical jurisprudence at the University of London. He died in 1829.  Goodwyn is best known for his work on the structure and function of the human heart. In 1802, he published a book titled "An Essay on the Principle of Life and Death", which is considered to be one of the first books to discuss biology from a mechanistic perspective. He also published works on lung disease, cataracts, and other medical topics.

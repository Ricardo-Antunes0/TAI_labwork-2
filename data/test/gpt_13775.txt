Pietro Loredan (1372 â€“ 28 October 1438) was an Italian humanist and rhetorician, and one of the founders of modern Italian prose.  Loredan was born in Arezzo, Tuscany. He studied at the University of Padua, where he was influenced by Marsilio Ficino and Pomponazzi. He then travelled to Paris, where he studied under Jean de Meun and became acquainted with the works of Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio. On his return to Italy, he began teaching rhetoric at the University of Florence. He also served as a diplomat for the Florentine Republic.   Loredan is best known for his treatise "De Imitatione Christi" (1419), which is a seminal work in the development of the rhetorical art. His other notable works include "De Arte Rhetorica" (1433), "De Oratore" (1437), and "Dialogo di Platone e Aristotele" (1439). Loredan died in Florence at the age of 73.

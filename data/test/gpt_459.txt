The Shihezi Headquarters Farm  is an agricultural research and development center operated by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. It is located in the northeast of Hebei province, about 100 kilometers south of the provincial capital Shijiazhuang.  The farm was founded in 1954 as a result of a collaboration between the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAS) and the Soviet Union's Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The farm was initially established to study the effects of different types of agriculture on soil fertility and plant growth. In recent years, however, the farm has expanded its research activities to include agricultural production technologies, animal breeding, and crop nutrition.  The Shihezi Headquarters Farm is also a major center for training agricultural scientists and technicians from both China and foreign countries. The farm has a total area of about 2,000 hectares, and it operates a number of research stations including the Center for Soil Science, the Center for Plant Breeding and Genetics, the Center for Crop Nutrition Research, and the Center for Animal Breeding Research.

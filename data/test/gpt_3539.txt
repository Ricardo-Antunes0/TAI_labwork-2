An ostracon (Greek:  ostrakon, plural  ostraca) is a type of stone fragment that was used as a writing medium in ancient Greece and Rome.  The word derives from the Ancient Greek ὀστρακων (ostrakon), meaning 'of stones'. Ostracon pieces were broken off larger pieces of limestone or marble to create small pieces that could be easily carried. These fragments were then used as written messages or to record mathematical calculations. Ostracon writing was popular in antiquity and remained in use until the 1st century AD.

Jewels of Stringology: Text Algorithms is a book on algorithms for pattern matching in strings and related problems. It was written by Maxime Crochemore and Wojciech Rytter, and published by World Scientific in 2003. Topics The first topics of the book are two basic string-searching algorithms for finding exactly-matching substrings, the Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm and the Boyer–Moore string-search algorithm. It then describes the suffix tree, an index for quickly looking up matching substrings, and two algorithms for constructing it. Other topics in the book include the construction of deterministic finite automata for pattern recognition, the discovery of repeated patterns in strings, constant-space string matching algorithms, and the lossless compression of strings. Approximate string matching is covered in several variations including edit distance and the longest common subsequence problem. The book concludes with advanced topics including two-dimensional pattern matching, parallel algorithms for pattern matching, the shortest common superstring problem, parameterized pattern matching and duplicate code detection, and the Rabin–Karp algorithm.

The Global Consciousness Project (GCP, also called the Global Mind Project) is an international non-profit organization founded in 1999 by Dr. John Hagelin with the stated goal of creating a "global consciousness" or "global mind." The GCP has worked with organizations and individuals in over 60 countries to promote awareness of the interconnectedness of all life, and to develop methods for enhancing the coherence and resilience of global networks.  The GCP has formulated a 10-point plan for creating a global mind, which includes the promotion of science, democracy, and interfaith understanding; the development of global consensus-building mechanisms; and the cultivation of spiritual values and practices that support global unity. The GCP also seeks to promote the development of new technologies that can support global communication and collaboration, as well as the emergence of "global citizens" who are aware of their responsibilities to the world community.

The Kalisch Review was a set of journals published by the Vienna branch of the Jewish Social Democratic Labor Party in the years 1918-1933. The journals covered a wide range of topics, including literature, philosophy, history, and social sciences.   The Kalisch Review was established in 1918 as a successor to the JÃ¼dische Arbeiter-Zeitung, which had been shut down by the Austro-Hungarian authorities in 1916. The editorial board of the Kalisch Review was headed by Victor Adler and included such leading intellectuals as Max Adler, Leo Baeck, Rudolf Breitscheid, and Erich Fromm.  The Kalisch Review was instrumental in launching the careers of such Jewish authors as Franz Kafka, Arthur Koestler, and Hannah Arendt. It also served as a forum for debate on controversial issues such as Zionism and anti-Semitism. The journal ceased publication in 1933 after being banned by Nazi authorities.

The Last Emperox is a space opera science fiction novel written by American author David Weber and released on October 12, 2006. It is the fourth book in the Honor Harrington series.  The novel tells the story of the final battle between Earth and the alien Kzinti empire, with the fate of the galaxy hanging in the balance.  Weber's previous novel, The Mandate, introduced the readers to Honor Harrington, a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy who becomes involved in a war against an alien race known as the Kzinti. In The Last Emperox, Harrington is assigned to lead a team of warships on a daring mission to destroy a Kzinti stronghold on a remote world. If successful, it will likely mean the end of the war. However, Harrington soon discovers that her mission is far more complicated than she anticipated.

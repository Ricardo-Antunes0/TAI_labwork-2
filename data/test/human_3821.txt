Daniel's, opened in late 1975, was one of the first lesbian bars in Spain and one of the first LGBT bars in Barcelona.  Opened by  María del Carmen Tobar, it originally was a bar and billiards room but expanded to have a dance hall. The bar attracted women from a wide variety of backgrounds including non-lesbian women. In the early years of the Spanish democratic transition the bar was accepted because its owner was well connected in the local government through Daniela her band-mate. The police still occasionally raided the bar, however, during its early years. Tobar played an active role in making Daniel's the center of lesbian life in Barcelona, sponsoring sports teams and a theater group. The bar also sold feminist literature, including the magazine call Red de Amazonas.  The bar later closed, but would be remembered in books and exhibits for its importance in the lesbian history of Spain. History  Daniel's was one of the first lesbian bars in Spain and one of the first LGBTQ bars in Barcelona. It was located at Plaza de Cardona 7–8, in the Sant Gervasi neighborhood. Daniel's was opened in 1975 by María del Carmen Tobar (born in 1943 in Barcelona), shortly after Franco's death. It was named after a musical group, Daniela, which Tobar had founded with Teresa and Gisele. The bar was originally opened as a non-profit association to avoid the high tax rate. For this reason, patrons had to ring a bell outside to gain entrance, and were only admitted if they were known to Tobar herself.

Rather Ripped is the fourteenth studio album by American rock band Tenacious D. It was released on October 15, 2016, through Hollywood Records. The album was produced by Jack Black and Kyle Gass, marking their first album together since the release of their 2006 film Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny.  The album's title is a reference to the phrase "rather ripped", which is often used when referring to someone who has undergone significant body transformation, such as weight loss. The album's lyrical content is largely inspired by Black's divorce from actress Black Swan co-star Mila Kunis.  Rather Ripped debuted at No. 12 on the Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 27,000 copies in the United States.

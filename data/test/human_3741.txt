Basic hostility is a psychological concept first described by psychoanalyst Karen Horney. Horney described it as aggression which a child develops as a result of "basic evil". Horney generally defines basic evil as "invariably the lack of genuine warmth and affection". Basic evil includes all range of inappropriate parental behavior – from lack of affection to abuse. This situation of abuse and torment that can not be avoided or escaped causes kids to have a higher level of irritability. The same can be said for anxiety. Background  Specifically, basic hostility pertains to a sense of anger and betrayal that a child feels towards his parents for their failure to provide a secure environment. Horney associated this concept with "basic anxiety", citing that the two are inseparably interwoven and are both offshoots of the "basic evil" of parental mistreatment. Their relationship can be explained in this manner: The existence of basic evil leads to basic hostility towards the parents and the world. Once such hostility is repressed it becomes basic anxiety or the feeling of being and helpless.

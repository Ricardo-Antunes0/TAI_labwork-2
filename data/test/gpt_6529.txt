The Kamieniec Ząbkowicki Palace  is a palace located in the town of Ząbkowice Śląskie, southern Poland. It is one of the most important Renaissance palaces in the country, and is also one of the few royal residences in Europe built in the Renaissance style.  The palace was built between 1596 and 1612 by King Sigismund III Vasa for his second wife, Queen Bona Sforza. The original design was by Italian architect Filippo Brunelleschi. The palace was extensively damaged in World War II and restored between 1988 and 1990 by the then Prime Minister Lech Wałęsa. The palace is currently used as a museum.

Anaheim Street or Anaheim is an at grade light rail station on the A Line of the Los Angeles Metro Rail. It has an island platform, and is located in the median of Long Beach Boulevard just south of its intersection with Anaheim Street in the city of Long Beach, California. This station is not named after the city of Anaheim, which is about  away; it is named after the street near which it is located. History When the line opened on July 14, 1990, as the Blue Line, this station was the southern terminus until the Downtown Long Beach Loop opened several months later. To facilitate the loop, which runs in a clockwise direction, the two main tracks cross each other at an "X" within the median at 9th Street south of this station. The southbound track then continues in the median by itself beyond 8th Street, passes two stations, then curves west onto the 1st Street Transit Mall, where it has a brief 2-track segment through the Downtown Long Beach station (which is designated as the terminal point of the line). From there, the tracks continue as northbound, first turning north into the median of Pacific Avenue (where they rejoin as a single track). After passing one more station, the track then curves east onto 8th Street before turning back north onto Long Beach Boulevard.

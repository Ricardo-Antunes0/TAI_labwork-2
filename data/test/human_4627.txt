George Washington Orton (January 10, 1873 â€“ June 24, 1958) was a Canadian middle and long-distance runner. In 1900, he became the first Canadian to win a medal at an Olympic Games. He won a bronze in the 400 metre hurdles, and then, 45 minutes later, won the gold medal in the 2500 metre steeplechase. Biography Born in Strathroy, Ontario, Orton was paralyzed when he fell out of a tree at the age of 3.  He had suffered a blood clot on the brain, and had severely damaged his right arm.  He could not walk until age 10, and fully regained his mobility around age 12. Orton did his undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto, earning a B.A. in 1893 in Romance Languages. He was then offered a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania in 1893 to complete his Masters (1894) and Ph.D. in Philosophy (1896).  By then, he was already the top middle-distance runner in the world. He won a then-record 17 national titles in the United States, along with seven in Canada, and one in the United Kingdom. He won the U.S. one-mile championship six times, the two-mile steeplechase seven times, the Cross Country twice, the five-mile run and the ten-mile run. While a student at the University of Toronto in 1892, Orton set a mile record of 4:21.8 which lasted for 42 years.  In total, he won 131 races, including a staggering 33 National and International championships.

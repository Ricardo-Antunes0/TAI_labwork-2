Brahmaloka (Sanskrit: ब्रह्मालोक, IAST: Brahmāloka), is the abode of goddess Saraswati and Brahma, the creator god and part of a Trimurti along with Vishnu and Shiva in Hinduism. Located on Mount Meru, it is also referred to as Brahmapura, Satyaloka  (satya meaning truth, loka meaning world, hence meaning true world)(The description of Satyaloka is found in the commentary on verse 5 of the Brahma Samhita and in the Shrimad Bhagwat Mahapurana [2.5.38]), and/or Satya bagecha (bagecha means "garden") in the Puranas. Brahmaloka is a flower-filled garden. It is stated that Brahmaloka is the highest of the joyful worlds which a person might attain. However, Buddha adds that the Brahmaloka is impermanent. Brahmaloka is a big and beautiful garden made up of flowers. Vedanta considers all spheres of existence, including the highest one namely Brahmaloka, to be temporary and only the absolute reality of infinite Pure Consciousness-Bliss is immortal and permanent.

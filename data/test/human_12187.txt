Società Cultura Fisica Quarnero (in Croatian Sportsko Društvo Kvarner) was a Fiume-based football club, the restructured U.S. Fiumana under the new sport rules formed socialist state of Yugoslavia, and the predecessor to today's HNK Rijeka. In 1948 it was renamed to Club Calcio Quarnero (in Croatian NK Kvarner) and was in 1954 to NK Rijeka. History  Quarnero was created on the 29th of July 1946 as the successor to the previous municipal-owned representative club of Rijeka, U.S. Fiumana, a brand name at the time considered by communist compromised by playing in the Italian football championships during the fascist regime. The new name followed the more geographic naming conventions requested to local councils by the central authorities in Belgrade in order to approve the reestablishment of the local sport club activities and to participate in competitions. All sport and football clubs in Yugoslavia got formally disbanded in 1945 and almost all rebranded with more ideologically-sounding names. Fiume and the whole B Zone of the Julian march being at the time still legally a part of Italy and formally under Jugoslav military administration, was not subject to these laws. Fiumana's management, players, supporters, headquarters and stadium simply continued under the new city club brand Quarnero. The club played a first home game under the new name against Hajduk Split, beating it 2-0 with goals from Petroni and Nori. Like all other clubs in the new state, has several sports sections added to it, 11 of them, some of which have achieved solid results in various fields: in boxing, fencing, basketball and tennis. International tennis champion Orlando Sirola started his career in Quarnero, before his exile.

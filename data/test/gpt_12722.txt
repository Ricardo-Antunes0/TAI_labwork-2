Nezim Berati (ca. 1680-1760), alternatively known as Nezim Frakulla or Nezim Bey, was an Ottoman military commander and statesman.  Born in the principality of Berat in the Ottoman Empire, Frakulla rose through the ranks of the military and served as governor of several provinces before being appointed Grand Vizier in 1736. He played a major role in consolidating Ottoman power in Anatolia and the Balkans during the latter part of his tenure, and was instrumental in suppressing a series of rebellions. Frakulla died in 1760 after ruling for nearly thirty years.  Frakulla is best known for his military campaigns against the Russian Empire, which culminated in the Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji (1739). He is also remembered for his efforts to modernize Ottoman society and economy, and for his patronage of art and literature. He has been described as one of the most accomplished Ottoman statesmen of his era.

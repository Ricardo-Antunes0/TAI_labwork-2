Dame Louisa Innes Lumsden  (31 December 1840 – 2 January 1935) born in Aberdeen, Scotland, was a pioneer of female education. Having been a student and a tutor in classics at Girton College, Cambridge, she became the first Headmistress of St Leonards School, Fife, and first warden of University Hall, University of St Andrews. She is credited with introducing lacrosse to St Leonards. When Scottish suffrage organisations organised the planting of The Suffragette Oak to mark some women getting the vote in 1918, Lumsden was given the honour of planting it. Early life Louisa was third daughter and youngest of seven children of Clements Lumsden, Aberdeen advocate and Writer to the Signet, and Jane, née Forbes. After her father's death in 1853, when she was 12, Louisa's mother moved temporarily to Cheltenham and Louisa attended a private school there, then becoming a boarder at the Château de Koekelberg, Brussels, which she left in 1856 for a smaller school in London. She returned to live with her family in Aberdeenshire in 1857.

"Kool Thing" is a song by American rock band Sonic Youth, released in June 1990 in the United States (as a promotional single) and September 1990 in Europe, as the first single from their  sixth studio album Goo. The song was inspired by an interview bassist/singer Kim Gordon conducted with LL Cool J for Spin. Although he is never mentioned by name, the song's lyrics contain several references to LL Cool J. Gordon's lyrics make reference to several of the rapper's works, including the single "I Can't Live Without My Radio" and the album Walking with a Panther. She also repeats the line "I don't think so", which appears in LL Cool J's "Going Back to Cali". Chuck D also contributed spoken vocals to the song. Music video The music video for "Kool Thing", released on June 4, 1990, was the band's first for a major label. The video was directed by Tamra Davis. The video focused on Gordon's fascination with 1960s radicalism (particularly Patty Hearst and the Black Panthers), and featured the band wearing glam style clothing. The video was stylized after LL Cool J's "Going Back to Cali" video, down to the black-and-white camera and go-go dancers. Gordon initially wanted to wear a beret and carry an Uzi, as a self-described "poseur-leftist girl lusting after Black Panthers concept". However, Geffen vetoed the plan. Chuck D appeared in the video.

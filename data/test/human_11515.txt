Chess City (also referred to as City-Chess;  Siti-Chess or  Gorod Shakhmat) is a large complex devoted to chess and chess competitions located east of Elista, Kalmykia, in Russia.  The neighborhood-size development consists of a central, four-story domed City Chess Hall surrounded by an Olympic-style village of Californian-Mediterranean Revival Style architecture.  The site has a conference center, public swimming pool and a museum of Kalmyk Buddhist art.  The complex features sculptures and artwork devoted to chess, including a statue of Ostap Bender, a fictional character of popular books written by Ilya Ilf and Yevgeni Petrov, who proposed the creation of a world chess capital.  The complex has been used to host visiting dignitaries like the Dalai Lama. Completed in 1998, the idea and development of Chess City is directly the result of Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, Kalmykia's millionaire President who has ruled the republic since 1993 and was president of FIDE, the international governing body of chess, from 1995 until his ousting in 2018.  A fanatical chess enthusiast, Ilyumzhinov had the complex built in time for the 33rd Chess Olympiad.

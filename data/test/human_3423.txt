Constantine of Murom (Russian: Святой Блаженный Князь Константин) (11th century - 1129) known as Saint Constantine the Blessed was a direct descendant of Vladimir I of Kiev and the son of Prince Svyatoslav of Chernigov. Life At Constantine's request, his father assigned him to rule the city of Murom, which at the time was inhabited by pagans, that he might spread Christianity in that region. According to the traditional account of his life, Constantine first sent his son Michael to Murom as his emissary, but the inhabitants threw him from the walls, so Constantine was obliged to take the city by force.  However, he made no headway in converting them to Christianity and at one point they became so angry that a mob made their way to his fortress intending to storm the place. According to legend, when he appeared before them bearing what is now known as the Murom-Ryazan icon of the Theotokos, they quieted down and bowed reverently before the holy image. His son Fyodor, with his support, continued the missionary work in the surrounding countryside.

Eothyris is a genus of extinct synapsid reptiles that lived during the Late Triassic epoch. It is known from a single species, Eothyris tullbergi, which was described from a partial skeleton found in the Tullberg area of southern Sweden.  Eothyris is one of the most primitive known synapsids, and is the only member of its genus. It was relatively small, measuring only about 2 metres (6.6 ft) in length, and had a lizard-like body shape with a long tail. Although it possessed teeth, it is not known if it ate anything other than plants. Eothyris was probably an active climber, as its skull is well-preserved and bears evidence of wear from climbing.

Gretchen Lynn Kalonji (born April 13, 1953) is an American materials scientist and academic administrator. She is dean of Sichuan University-Hong Kong Polytechnic University Institute for Disaster Management and Reconstruction. Kalonji was previously the assistant director-general for natural sciences at UNESCO. She was the Kyocera Professor of Materials Science at University of Washington and an associate professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Early life and education  Kalonji was born April 13, 1953 in Chicago, Illinois to journalist parents and, after the age of seven, grew up moving between India, Hong Kong, Thailand, and East Africa. She was kicked out of school twice in Hong Kong during the 1967 leftist riots in which she participated in the siege of the U.S. embassy and protests against the Vietnam War. She was also kicked out of school in east Africa and eventually began working in metallurgy and learned practical skills in welding, milling, turning, elementary design, and drafting. Kalonji planned on applying for Kenyan citizenship after completing schooling in the United States. She enrolled at University of Maryland, College Park as a special student because she had not completed a high school diploma. She took courses in chemistry and materials science. After meeting Julia McCormick, the admissions director at MIT, Kalonji began undergraduate coursework at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in February 1979. Kalonji earned a B.Sc. in May 1980 and a Ph.D. in 1982 in materials science and engineering. She completed her dissertation in five semesters after her B.S. under the direction of Samuel M. Allen in 1982. She completed a cooperative internship at National Institute of Standards and Technology (then National Bureau of Standards) under mentor John W. Cahn. Kalonji's future research was influenced by courses she took with  and Bernie Wuensch.

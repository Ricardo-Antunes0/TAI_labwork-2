Horoscope is a ballet created in 1937 by Russian choreographer Michel Fokine. It is based on the play Horoscope by French author Pierre Loti and tells the story of a love affair between a young man and a woman.   The original choreography for Horoscope was created by Michel Fokine, who also directed the premiere performance at the Paris Opera on 9 January 1937. The ballet's premiere was not well-received, with many critics finding its thematic material too fanciful for the classical ballet tradition. Nevertheless, over time the work has come to be highly regarded, and it has undergone several revisions and restorations.  Today Horoscope is one of the most popular ballets in the world, widely performed by leading ballet companies throughout the world. Its popularity has been attributed in part to its accessible themes and stunningly fluid choreography.

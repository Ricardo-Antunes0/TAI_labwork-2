Within visual perception, an optical illusion (also called an optical illusion, optical delusion, or visual illusion) is a type of psychological illusion where the visual appearance of an object or scene is different from its actual physical form. The most common type of optical illusion is the Deception of Depth, in which an object appears to be closer or farther away than it actually is. Other types of illusions include the Ponzo Illusion and the Necker Cube.  An optical illusion can be created by any object or scene that appears to have a different physical appearance from its actual form. Common examples include the Deception of Depth, in which an object appears to be closer or farther away than it actually is; and the Ponzo Illusion, in which a complex pattern appears to be simpler than it actually is. Optical illusions can also be created by images that are distorted or altered in some way.

She married Tim Rutherford and has a son. Before she moved to Wanaka, she alternated between Verbier, Switzerland, and Wanaka so that she could both live in the southern and northern hemisphere. After she married Tim, she moved to his farm in Tarras. She settled down officially in Wanaka. The South Island is filled with peaks and lakes where the bottom can be seen from the top. She went to Wanaka for the outdoor factor and that is where she likes to photograph the most. According to Rutherford, the outdoors are where the pictures turn out the best.

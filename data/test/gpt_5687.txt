A triode is an electronic amplifying vacuum tube that was invented in 1907 by the British engineer John Ambrose Fleming. Triodes are most commonly used in audio amplifier applications, where they provide increased amplification over the vacuum tube counterparts.  Triodes are made from three pieces of glass that are heated and then sealed together. Electrons flow easily through the hot glass, which allows an audio signal to be amplified through the triode. The triode is most commonly used in audio amplifier applications, where it provides increased amplification over the vacuum tube counterparts. Triodes can be used to amplify audio signals up to 1 million times their original strength.

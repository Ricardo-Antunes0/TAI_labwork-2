Corvette K-225 is a  1943 American two-seat, low-wing monoplane fighter aircraft. It was the only U.S. fighter design produced during World War II specifically for night fighting, and was the first American fighter to be specifically designed to operate in that role.  The K-225 was developed as a stopgap measure to meet the needs of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) for a night fighter that could replace the aging P-38 Lightning and P-51 Mustang night fighters. The K-225 entered service with the USAAF in 1944, but had poor performance and was withdrawn from service after only six months due to its high operational losses.

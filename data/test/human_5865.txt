Al-Badeel (, lit. “the alternative”) was a privately owned Egyptian newspaper known for its left-wing orientation. Its first issue was published on July 16, 2007. It was founded by Mohamed El-Sayed Said, Vice-President of the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies and Editor-in-Chief from the foundation of Al-Badeel until September 2008, when he was replaced by Khaled al-Balshi. History Print publication ended on April 10, 2009, due mainly to lack of funds. The Board of the Progress for Peace and Advertising Company, the publisher, tried unsuccessfully to raise capital. Al-Balshi and a number of the journalists revived the publication in electronic form in November 2010. Rumors circulated in 2011-12 about a complete end of the publication after a series of strikes and factional protests among the journalists. Controversies included Ibrahim Eissa’s appointment as Editor-in-Chief and allegedly arbitrary dismissals of some journalists. In November 2015, publication ended due to poor circulation.

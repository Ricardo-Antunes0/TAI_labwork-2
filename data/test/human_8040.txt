For her first event, the  women's K-2 500 metres, Zhou and her partner Wu Yanan narrowly missed out of the Olympic medal in the A-final by nearly fourteen hundredths of a second (0.14) behind the Polish pair Karolina Naja and Beata Mikołajczyk, posting their time of 1:44.136. Three days later, Zhou barely advanced to the semi-final rounds of the first ever women's K-1 200 metres, after finishing sixth and attaining a qualified time of 42.885 seconds in the heats. Unfortunately, Zhou fell short in her bid for the final by seven hundredths of a second (0.07) behind Slovenia's Špela Ponomarenko, with a time of 42.279 seconds.

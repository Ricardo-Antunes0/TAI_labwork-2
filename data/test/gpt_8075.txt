The undue burden standard is a constitutional standard that is used to determine whether a regulation imposes an unconstitutional burden on a person's rights. The standard is based on the principle that the government cannot impose an unreasonable burden on individuals.  The undue burden standard was first introduced in the United States Supreme Court case of Massachusetts v. United States, in which the court ruled that a federal law requiring fishermen to use fixed nets was unconstitutional because it placed an excessive burden on their right to fish. The standard has since been applied in a number of other cases, most notably in Rapanos v. United States, which involved a challenge to a federal regulation that imposed a fishing ban in certain areas of the country.  The undue burden standard is often used in conjunction with the rational basis test, which is used to determine whether a law is based on legitimate reasons. Under the rational basis test, courts must look at the statute as a whole and consider whether it has been enacted with a legitimate purpose, i.e. whether it is reasonable and sensible. If the law does not meet this criteria, it can be struck down as unconstitutional.  The undue burden standard is an important tool for protecting individual rights and ensuring that government regulations are constitutional. It can be used to invalidate laws that are overly burdensome or unnecessary, and it has been instrumental in protecting individual freedoms throughout the years.

Piezoluminescence is a form of luminescence created by the excited state emission of electrons from a material that has been bombarded with an energetic particle. These excited electrons return to the ground state, releasing energy in the form of photons. The most common sources of piezoluminescence are crystals of strontium titanate and barium titanate, which are commonly used in light emitting diodes and displays.

Akhmed Chatayev, Ahmad Shishani (, Ахмад Шишани; 14 July 1980 – 22 November 2017) was a Chechen Islamist, terrorist, and Islamic State leader who is thought to have been the planner of the 2016 Istanbul airport attack. He was killed in a shootout with Georgian security forces in Tbilisi on 22 November 2017. From Chechnya to Syria Chatayev was born 14 July 1980 in Vedeno village, Vedensky District, Chechnya, in the then Checheno-Ingush ASSR, in Soviet Russia. He participated in the Second Chechen War and lost his arm in the battle. He then fled Russia in 2001 to Austria where he was granted refugee status in 2003. In 2008 he and several other Chechens were detained in the Swedish town of Trelleborg. Police found weapons in his car and he spent more than a year in a local prison. On 3 January 2010, he was detained in Uzhhorod in western Ukraine. According to Interior Minister Yuriy Lutsenko, his mobile phone contained instructions for explosives, as well as photographs of those killed in explosions. He faced extradition to Russia but on 14 January, after strong protests by Amnesty International, which claimed he could face torture if he was returned to Russia, the European Court of Human Rights called upon the Ukrainian authorities not to extradite him.

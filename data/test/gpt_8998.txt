Lichine (foaled 5 May 1979) was an Irish-bred, French-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was one of the most consistent performers in French racing during the 1990s, winning eight of his thirteen starts including the prestigious Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 1997. After his retirement from racing he had some success as a breeding stallion.  Lichine was a dark brown horse with a white blaze and three white socks on his hind legs bred in Ireland by the Fenton family. As a yearling he was bought by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, who sent him to be trained in France by Francois Boutin.  Lichine made his debut in a maiden race over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 15 May 1992 and won easily. He followed this up by winning the Group Two Prix du Jockey Club over the same distance at Longchamp Racecourse on 8 June. In July he contested the Group Three Criterium de Saint-Cloud over 1600 metres, but was beaten a neck by Regalbuto.  On his first appearance of the 1993 season Lichine started second favourite for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres but finished fourth behind Regalbuto, War Cry and Brigadier. On his final appearance of the year he won the Group One Prix Ganay over 2400 metres at Longchamp.  In 1994 Lichine was moved up in class

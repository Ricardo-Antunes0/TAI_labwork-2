De Munitionibus Castrorum ("Concerning the fortifications of a military camp") is a work by an unknown author. Due to this work formerly being attributed to Hyginus Gromaticus, its author is often called "Pseudo-Hyginus". This work is the most detailed surviving description of a Roman military camp (Latin: castra) and dates most probably from the late 1st to early 2nd century AD. The author and the time of creation of the work  Very little is known about the author of De munitionibus castrorum. According to the text, his work was intended to be a useful manual about how to properly lay out a military camp, specially written for a high-ranked officer: "novitatem metationis ad magnitudinem tuam primus adferam, quae tibi spero placebit, si primum cottidianam metationem tractabis" He also suggests that he was a beginner author and used other authors' works relevant to the theme: "In quantum potui, domine frater, pro tirocinio meo, in brevi omnes auctores sum persecutus, sed quidquid circa compositionem castrorum aestalivium instituerunt, in hoc libello, priusquam numeros instituerem, sub ratione omnia declaravi"

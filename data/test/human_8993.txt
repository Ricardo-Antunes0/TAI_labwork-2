Marcel Boekhoorn (; born 30 October 1959 in Nijmegen) is a Dutch entrepreneur, investor, philanthropist and owner of investment company Ramphastos Investments. Boekhoorn has a wide array of business interests in the Netherlands and beyond. With an estimated net worth of €1.9 billion (US$2.2 billion), Boekhoorn is one of the wealthiest individuals in the Netherlands. Marcel Boekhoorn, a CPA by training, started his career as a chartered accountant (Register Accountant - RA) with accounting organisation Deloitte & Touche in 1981. By 1991 he had become the organization’s youngest partner to date. In 1994, Boekhoorn founded his investment vehicle Ramphastos Investments and started to invest in unconventional companies that had little traction with other investors (such as small wheelbarrow manufacturers and a spray can producer). The key approach of Boekhoorn’s investment strategy is to place emphasis on adding value to the revenue side of the business equation, rather than exclusively focussing on cost reduction. This approach sets Ramphastos Investments apart from many companies in the private equity world. Boekhoorn is furthermore known for his focus on value creation through buy-and-build strategies, marketplace innovation, internationalisation, management empowerment and strategic partnerships.

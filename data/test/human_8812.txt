Arthur Joyce Lunel Cary (7 December 1888 â€“ 29 March 1957) was an Anglo-Irish novelist and colonial official. Early life and education Arthur Joyce Lunel Cary was born in his grand-parents' home, above the Belfast Bank in Derry, Ireland in 1888. His family had been 'Planter' landlords in neighbouring Inishowen, a peninsula on the north coast of County Donegal, also in Ulster, since the early years of the Plantation of Ulster in the early seventeenth century. However, the family had largely lost its Inishowen property on the western shores of Lough Foyle after the passage of the Irish Land Act in 1882. The family dispersed and Cary had uncles who served in the frontier US Cavalry and the Canadian North-West Mounted Police. Most of the Carys wound up in Great Britain. Arthur Cary, his father, moved to London in 1884 and trained as an engineer. He then married Charlotte Joyce, elder daughter of James John Joyce, manager of the Belfast Bank, Londonderry in August 1887 and they settled in London. His mother died of pneumonia in October 1898.

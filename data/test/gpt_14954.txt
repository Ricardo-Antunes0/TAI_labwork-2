The Ébène Quartet (French: Quatuor Ébène) is a French string quartet founded in 1975. The quartet is composed of violinists Pierre Amoyal, Emmanuel Pahud, Laurent Naouri and violist Daniel Barenboim, with occasional guest appearances by other instruments.  The Ébène Quartet was founded in 1975 by Pierre Amoyal, Emmanuel Pahud, Laurent Naouri and Daniel Barenboim. They have since appeared as a chamber music ensemble with other orchestras and soloists throughout the world. In 1984 they gave the first performance of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's String Quintet in C major, K. 590, in Salzburg. In 1994 they performed Bartók's String Quartet No. 3 in D minor, Sz. 159, for the first time in its entirety at the Lucerne Festival. They also made a recording of this work with the Staatskapelle Berlin.   The Ébène Quartet has also collaborated with other artists, including Luciano Berio, Sir Simon Rattle, Yo-Yo Ma and Jacqueline du Pré. In 2007 they gave the first performance of Philip Glass's Violin Concerto in D major, with the Berlin Philharmonic under Daniel Barenboim.

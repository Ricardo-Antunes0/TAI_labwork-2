Bartholomew Lloyd (1772â€“1837) was an Irish mathematician and academic whose entire career was spent at Trinity College Dublin. As Erasmus Smith's Professor of Mathematics there, he promoted significant curricular reforms, including the introduction of the teaching of calculus. Later he served as Provost of the college. Life Born at New Ross, County Wexford, 5 February 1772, he was son of Humphrey Lloyd, himself the son of the Rev. Bartholomew Lloyd of the Abbey House of New Ross. His father died while he was still a boy, and an uncle, the Rev. John Lloyd, rector of Ferns and Kilbride, to whose care he had been given, also died shortly, so that he was left to struggle for himself. He entered Trinity College Dublin, in 1787 as a pensioner. In 1790 he was elected a Scholar of the College, in 1792 graduated B.A., and in 1796 obtained a junior fellowship. He graduated M.A. in the same year, B.D. in 1805, and D.D. in 1808.

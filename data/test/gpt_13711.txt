Arnold Rothstein (January 17, 1882 â€“ November 26, 1935) was an American organized crime figure who is best known for his role in the "Big Five" gangland killings.  Rothstein was born in 1882 in New York City to Jewish immigrants. After a brief stint as a candy store clerk, he started working as a numbers runner in the early 1900s. Rothstein became one of the most successful numbers runners of his time, and by the early 1910s had become involved in organized crime.  In 1922, Rothstein was arrested for thievery and sentenced to two years in prison. While in jail, Rothstein formed a partnership with Meyer Lansky and got involved in the "Big Five" gangland killings, which led to his release from prison. Rothstein continued to operate as a mobster until his death in 1935.

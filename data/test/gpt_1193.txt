Children is an early play by American playwright Edward Gurney. It was first produced in 1892 at the Little Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts.  Children is a comedy about the complications and misunderstandings that arise when a daughter moves to live with her father after her mother's death. The play features a cast of quirky characters, including the father, mother, daughter, and her new stepmother.  Children has been frequently performed on stage and radio since its debut. It was adapted for film in 1918 and again in 1939. The play has been widely anthologized and has been cited as an early example of modern comedy.  Edward Gurney was born on April 7, 1857, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He studied at Harvard University before embarking on a successful career as a playwright. His first major success came with the 1892 production of Children, which ran for more than 1,000 performances on Broadway. Gurney later wrote the plays The Cat and the Fiddle (1911), The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest (1912), and The Devil's Disciple (1919). He died on October 9, 1938, in New York City.

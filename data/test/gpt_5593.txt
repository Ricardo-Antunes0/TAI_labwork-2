Gennadi Gennadiyevich Touretski (, 17 July 1949 – 12 December 1995) was a Soviet and Russian mathematician, known for his seminal work in the theory of dynamical systems.  Born in Moscow, Touretski studied at the Moscow State University and the University of Cambridge, where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1976 under the supervision of Malcolm Maclaurin. From 1976 to 1981, he was a post-doctoral fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, before moving to Russia and joining the faculty of Moscow State University as a professor in 1981. He was a visiting professor at several universities, including Brown University and the Université Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris.  Touretski is best known for his work on dynamical systems, including chaotic dynamics, partial differential equations, and time-dependent differential equations. He also developed methods for studying self-organized phenomena and chaos in these systems. In 1992 he received the Fields Medal for his work on dynamical systems. He died in 1995 after a long illness.

Dieppa is a surname. Early Origins of the Dieppa surname many scholars point out to seafarer’s people. One source pointsout to the Norse seafarer’s people (Vikings warriors) from southern Scandinavia (in present-day Denmark, Norway and Sweden). It is known that they travel into France and founded the most distinguished port of Dieppe city.  Other historian and genealogical sources also connected the surname with another very important port, the port of Ajaccio in the island of Corsica (today France) as both side crossings path to many entrepreneurs, and noble families to and from Italy. Corsica is an island in the Mediterranean Sea and one of the 18 regions of France. It is the fourth-largest island in the Mediterranean and lies southeast of the French mainland, west of the Italian Peninsula, and immediately north of the Italian island of Sardinia, which is the landmass nearest to it. A single chain of mountains makes up two-thirds of the island. In 2018, it had a population of 338,550. The island is a territorial collectivity of France. The regional capital is Ajaccio.

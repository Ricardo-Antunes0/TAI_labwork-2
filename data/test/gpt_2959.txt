Diphyllobothrium is a genus of tapeworms which are parasitic on animals. The adult worms reside in the small intestine, and release eggs into the gut environment. These eggs hatch into larvae which migrate through the body to settle in a different part of the host, where they grow into adults. There are over 100 species of Diphyllobothrium, and they are found throughout the world on a variety of hosts.

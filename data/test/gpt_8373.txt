John Roger Lasater (December 8, 1931 - September 27, 1997) was an American economist who specialized in the study of public finance. He served as the Charles E. Smith Professor of Economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1970 until his death.  Lasater was born in Asheville, North Carolina, and earned a B.A. in economics from Davidson College in 1953 and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago in 1958. He taught at the University of Colorado from 1958 until he moved to Chapel Hill in 1970. In 1984, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Lasater's work focused on public finance, with a particular interest in how government spending affects economic growth and the distribution of income. He is best known for his book Public Finance: A New Analysis (with Laurence J. Kotlikoff), which is considered one of the seminal texts on the subject.

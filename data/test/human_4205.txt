Alexander Vasilyevich Stupin (;  February 1776 in Arzamas â€“  in Arzamas) was a Russian painter and art teacher. He founded and led the Arzamas School of Painting, Russia's first provincially based art school. Biography He was the illegitimate son of a nobleman. In 1787, he became an apprentice at the icon-painting workshop in Temnikov. Upon completing his course in 1799, he went to Saint Petersburg for further studies at the Imperial Academy of Arts under Ivan Akimov. In 1802, he left with a certificate (second-degree) and 200 rubles for expenses, courtesy of the Academy's Director. He then returned to Arzamas where he used some of the money to start the first, and for a long time only, private art school outside a major city. In 1809, the Academy took a supportive interest in his school, honoring him with the title of "Academician" and sending original art works or plaster casts for his students to copy; issuing silver medals as incentives.

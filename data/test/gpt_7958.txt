Country Thunder Saskatchewan (formerly the Craven Country Thunder Festival) is a country music festival that takes place annually in the small town of Craven, Saskatchewan. The event typically features multiple stages of music, along with attractions such as a rodeo, agricultural and livestock shows, a chuckwagon race, and a parade.  Country Thunder Saskatchewan was founded in 2007 by local promoter Robby Lovett. The inaugural event featured performances by Tim McGraw, George Strait, and Reba McEntire. Since its inception, the festival has grown to become one of Canada's largest country music events, with an attendance of over 100,000 people each year.  The festival is held over three days in late July or early August.

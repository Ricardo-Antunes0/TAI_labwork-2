Epilepsy can affect employment for a variety of reasons. Individuals with epilepsy may have difficulty with tasks that are common in the workplace, such as working with tools or standing for long periods of time. Additionally, epilepsy can lead to a decreased sense of awareness, which could lead to accidents on the job. In some cases, people with epilepsy may be unable to hold a job because of the strain it puts on their health.

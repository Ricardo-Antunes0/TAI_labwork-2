The Network Access License (NAL) is mandatory for telecommunication equipment that is exported to or sold in China. This license applies to telecommunication equipment that is connected to the public telecommunication network. For receiving the Network Access License, an application has to be submitted at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) in Beijing. Among others, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is responsible for the Chinese regulation and development of the Internet, wireless, broadcasting, communications and production of electronic and information goods, and the promotion of the national knowledge economy. History In 2001, the Chinese authorities published the first three product categories requiring NAL. Since then, about 25 product categories including about 300 different kinds of telecommunication devices have been added to the product catalogue. Furthermore, the NAL products are categorized in basic and high-end equipment. In August 2014, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued 495 network access licenses for telecom equipment.  In 2014, there are only 14 test laboratories that are authorized for the testing of the telecommunication equipment. Most of these test laboratories are specialized on product categories.

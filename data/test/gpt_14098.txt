Powerplex STL (stylized as POWERPlex STL), formerly known as PowerPlex, is a mixed-use redevelopment project in the River Market district of downtown Saint Louis, Missouri. The project is envisioned as a regional economic engine, creating thousands of jobs and generating millions of dollars in tax revenue.  The project was conceived in 2007 by the Saint Louis Development Corporation (SLDC) and is being developed by a consortium of local and national investors. The project will include a 1.2 million-square-foot (103,000 m2) office tower, a 1.5 million-square-foot (145,000 m2) hotel and convention center, a 1.1 million-square-foot (102,000 m2) retail district, and 300 residential units. Powerplex STL is scheduled to be completed in 2020.

An arrow is a graphical symbol, such as ‚Üê or ‚Üí, or a pictogram, used to point or indicate direction. In its simplest form, an arrow is a triangle, chevron, or concave kite, usually affixed to a line segment or rectangle, and in more complex forms a representation of an actual arrow (e.g. ‚ûµ U+27B5). The direction indicated by an arrow is the one along the length of the line or rectangle toward the single pointed end. History An older (medieval) convention is  the  manicule (pointing hand, üëà). Pedro Reinel in c. 1504 first used the  fleur-de-lis as indicating north in a compass rose;  the convention of marking the eastern direction with a cross is older (medieval). Use of the arrow symbol does not appear to pre-date the 18th century. An early arrow symbol is found in an illustration of Bernard Forest de B√©lidor's treatise L'architecture hydraulique, printed in France in 1737. The arrow is here used to illustrate the direction of the flow of water and of the water wheel's rotation. At about the same time, arrow symbols were used to indicate the flow of rivers in maps.

The Three Revelers Vase is one of the most famous pieces of Greek Bronze Age art and was one of the reasons that Heinrich Schliemann was so interested in excavating at Ithaca. The vase features three figures - a male figure with a lion's head, a female figure with a serpent's head, and a young boy - who are engaged in a lively dance. The figures are richly decorated with intricate detail, including needlework on the female figure's dress and jewelled necklaces on the male and young boy figures.  The Three Revelers Vase is one of the earliest known examples of Minoan art, which was a form of art that developed on Crete in the second millennium BC. This type of art typically features beautiful female figures with exaggerated body proportions and stylised hairstyles, which is why it has been called 'the Cretan style'.

The conifer swift moth (Korscheltellus gracilis) is a small moth in the family Geometridae. It is found in North America, where it has been recorded from California to Florida, west to Texas and north to New Brunswick.  This species can be distinguished from other members of the genus by its pale grey-green forewings with a very thin light yellow postmedian line and a series of black spots along the costa. The hindwings are paler than the forewings, with a dark terminal band. Adults are on wing from May to July in two generations per year.  The larvae feed on various conifers, including Douglas-fir and pine.

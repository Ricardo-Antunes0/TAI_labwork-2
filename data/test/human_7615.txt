Rebelline (foaled 29 April 1998) was an Irish Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. She won six of her eleven races in a racing career which lasted from October 2000 until May 2002. As a juvenile she won on her debut and then finished second to Vinnie Roe in the Eyrefield Stakes. In the following year she won the Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial and the Pretty Polly Stakes as well as finishing third in the Prix de l'Opéra. She reached her peak as a four-year-old in 2002 when she was undefeated in three starts, taking the Gladness Stakes, Mooresbridge Stakes and Tattersalls Gold Cup. After her retirement from racing she had considerable success as  a dam of winners. Background Rebelline is a bay mare with no white markings bred in Ireland by Peter Tellwright of the British-based Tyrley Castle Stud. As a foal in December 1999 the filly was offered for sale at Tattersalls and was sold for 28,000 guineas. She returned to the sales ring as a yearling at Goffs in October 1999 and was bought for IR£68,000 by Lady O'Reilly's Castlemartin Stud. She was sent into training with Kevin Prendergast and was ridden in all of her races by Declan McDonogh.

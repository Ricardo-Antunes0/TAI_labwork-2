The Brazil-Argentina football rivalry (also known as Superclásico de las Américas and Superclássico das Américas) is a sports rivalry between the national football teams of the two countries and their respective sets of fans. Games between the two teams, even those that are only friendly matches, are often marked by notable and controversial incidents. The rivalry has also been referred to as the "Battle of the Americas." FIFA have described it as the "essence of football rivalry", ESPN FC ranked it top of their list of rivalries between national sides, while CNN ranked it second on their top 10 list of international rivalries—only below the older England–Scotland football rivalry. Brazil-Argentina matches are often known for the high level of competitiveness and talent of the two squads. Brazil and Argentina are the two teams with the highest average Elo Rating calculated over the entire team history, with 1994 and 1984 respectively. Both are also routinely ranked among the top ten national teams in the world in both the FIFA World Rankings and the World Football Elo Ratings. Both countries have produced players considered at the time as the best in the world, such are the cases of Alfredo Di Stéfano, Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi for Argentina, and Pelé, Ronaldo, and Ronaldinho for Brazil.

The Real Geeks (however referred to as TRG Magazine) is a "geek culture" online magazine website with biweekly coverage of news and reviews in sections such as technology, music, entertainment, travel, and more, released in issues published every other Friday. The Real Geeks website was launched on January 10, 2011 by Ian Webb and Sam Linville, however the website has grown to have a full, operational staff. History Founder Ian Webb began developing The Real Geeks in October 2010. During the week of January 3, 2011, Webb finalized plans for The Real Geeks and version 1 of the site was officially launched on January 10. Due to the immediate heightened popularity and the multiple elements of The Real Geeks, the TRG Executive Team founded a parent company for The Real Geeks which they entitled TRG Media (the name reflects TRG, the flagship website). TRG Media also manages other online identities for other projects. After the closure of TRG Techcasts, TRG Media was officially dissolved in April 2012 and the company is now only The Real Geeks.

The Rev. Becca Stevens is an author, speaker, and ordained minister in the Presbyterian Church (USA). She is the author of several books, including Burned: A Memoir of Child Abuse and Recovery and The Wild Hunt: A Spiritual Journey into the Dark Side of Our Nature.  Born in the early 1980s in a small town in upstate New York, Stevens was raised by her mother after her father abandoned the family. At a young age, she experienced sexual abuse from a family member. This experience profoundly shaped her understanding of herself and her place in the world.   Stevens eventually moved to New York City to attend college. There, she began to explore her religious identity and found a community of like-minded individuals who were exploring their spirituality. It was during this time that she first became aware of child abuse and its impact on individuals and communities.  Stevens completed her undergraduate degree at Sarah Lawrence College in 1996 and then attended Union Theological Seminary where she received her theological degree in 2002. After graduation, she served as a pastor for two years before leaving the ministry to focus on writing and speaking full-time.  In addition to her writing, Stevens has spoken at universities around the United States and Canada, including Yale University, Brown University, the University of Notre Dame, and the University of Toronto. Her talks have focused on topics such as child abuse and recovery, grief and pain, and spiritual journey.  Stevens is currently an associate professor of theology at Union Theological Seminary where

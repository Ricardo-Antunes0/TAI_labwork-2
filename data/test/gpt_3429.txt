"Top Secret" is the sixteenth episode of the fifth season of House, and is written by David Shore and directed by Greg Yaitanes.  As the team tries to diagnose a mysterious case of lesions on a patient's skin, they are forced to reconsider their theories when House's former mentor, Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), pops up out of nowhere to offer his help. Meanwhile, Cuddy starts to feel pressure from the hospital administration to solve the case quickly, and Foreman takes matters into his own hands.

Long slow distance (LSD) is a form of endurance running, often described as a cross between running and cycling. LSD involves running or cycling at a slower pace for an extended period of time.  LSD is considered a form of endurance running because it is a slower-than-normal pace that is maintained for an extended period of time. Endurance running refers to any form of running that can be completed for a long period of time, such as 10K or longer. Cycling is also considered a form of endurance running, as cyclists can typically ride at a slower pace for an extended period of time.   The slowest possible speed achieved while running or cycling is referred to as the lactate threshold (LT). The LT is the point at which the body begins to produce more lactic acid than it can eliminate, and is typically determined by testing through a heart-rate monitor. Once the LT has been reached, further increases in speed will cause the body to produce even more lactic acid and result in greater fatigue.   The main benefits of LSD are that it provides an alternative method of training for runners and cyclists who are looking for a slower-than-normal pace, it allows runners and cyclists to train on their own schedule, and it can be done at any fitness level. Additionally, LSD can be used to improve overall endurance and stamina, as well as increase cardiovascular fitness.

The 1976 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1976 season. The 73rd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the National League (NL) champion  Cincinnati Reds and the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees. The Reds swept the Series in four games to repeat as champions, avenging their 1939 and 1961 World Series losses to the Yankees. The 1976 Reds became, and remain, the only team to sweep an entire multi-tier postseason, one of the crowning achievements of the franchise's Big Red Machine era. The Reds are also the last NL team to win back-to-back World Series. It also marked the second time that the Yankees were swept in a World Seriesâ€”the Los Angeles Dodgers were the first to sweep them in 1963. The Reds won the NL West division by 10 games over the Dodgers, then defeated the Philadelphia Phillies, three games to none, in the NL Championship Series after losing seven of 12 games to the Phillies during the regular season. The Yankees won the AL East division by  games over the Baltimore Orioles, then defeated the Kansas City Royals, three games to two, in the AL Championship Series.

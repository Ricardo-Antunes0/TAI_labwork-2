Stephen Ailes (May 25, 1912 â€“ June 18, 2017) was an American media executive and founder of Fox News Channel. He is considered one of the most influential figures in U.S. media, and was the driving force behind the conservative news channel's success. Ailes was also a political consultant, who worked on behalf of Republican candidates and causes.  Born in Buffalo, New York, Ailes began his career as a radio announcer and later served as president of Fox Broadcasting Company, where he helped launch the network in October 1986. He later became chairman and CEO of Fox News Channel, where he served until his resignation in July 2017 following sexual harassment allegations. Ailes was a major figure in U.S. media for over four decades, and his work at Fox News helped redefine news broadcasting and set the stage for the political polarization of today.

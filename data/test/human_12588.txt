The Chagrin Falls waterfalls are waterfalls spouting off of the Chagrin River in the center of the village of Chagrin Falls, Ohio. At the waterfall base, a viewing area is available. The falls were one of the largest industrial centers in the 1800s and are responsible for the growth of the village around them. History  The Chagrin Falls originally got their name from a French trader named Fran√ßois Seguin, who traded with Native Americans in the early 1700s. The river later adopted the name "Chagrin". At one point the Chagrin Falls was the industrial center of Northeast Ohio and powered 9 different mills at their peak.  The first settlers arrived in 1833 and they had previously been from New England.  With the profits they made from their mill work on the falls, they began to build their homes around the river and created the now current day Chagrin Falls village.

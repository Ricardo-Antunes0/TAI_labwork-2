The SEP modular armoured vehicle (Splitterskyddad enhetsplattform), more commonly known as the 'Splitters', is a Swedish armoured fighting vehicle designed and manufactured by BAE Systems Sweden AB.  The Splitters was developed as a new family of modular armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs) for the Swedish Army. The first prototype was completed in 2005 and entered service in 2007. The vehicle is based on the BAE Systems Land Systems Australia LAND 120 infantry fighting vehicle chassis, but has been extensively modified to meet Swedish requirements.  The Splitters is a heavily armed and armoured AFV designed for close-in combat. It can be equipped with a variety of armaments, including a 105 mm howitzer, 12.7 mm machine gun, or 40 mm grenade launcher. The vehicle can also be fitted with specialised reconnaissance and combat support equipment.

Guatemala , officially the Republic of Guatemala , is a country in Central America. At 5,231 square kilometers, it is the smallest by land area and has the lowest population density of any country in Central America.  The earliest evidence of human occupation in Guatemala dates back to 12,000 BC. The Maya civilization flourished for over two thousand years, before being violently destroyed by the Spanish in the 16th century. After centuries of colonial rule, Guatemala achieved independence from Spain in 1821. The country has been plagued by civil wars and violent crime ever since. However, during the past decade, Guatemala has made significant progress in terms of socioeconomic development and human rights.  Today, Guatemala is a democratic republic with a population of over 15 million people. The economy is dominated by agriculture, which accounts for about 60% of GDP. Other important sectors include textiles, mining, and manufacturing. Guatemala is a member of the United Nations, the Organization of American States, and the Central American Integration System.

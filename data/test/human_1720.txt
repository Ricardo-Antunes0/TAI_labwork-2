Development The majority of the album, if not the core of the album was done over the internet with Edo Maajka and his producers exchanging files electronically. Edo Maajka explained in an interview that he already had some songs ready which he made with the band, but after he realized he had to do most of the album of the internet, he gave up those songs and started to select beats to work on new songs. After he assembled a lot of the beats, he started to write and work on those beats. Edo Maajka further states that after he recorded some, he got the arrangement for the song then he worked with Miro Vidović of Morris Studio over Skype to finalize the arrangement and mixing of the songs. "Basically it is a lot of mails, Skype and uploaded songs" says Edo Maajka.

Corymbia grandifolia, commonly known as the cabbage tree, is a large, highly branched shrub or small tree that grows up to 4 metres (13 feet) tall. The smooth, green bark is scaly and fissured. The leaves are ovate-elliptical, 20–50 cm (8-20 in) long and 9–15 cm (3.5-6 in) wide, with serrated margins. The flowers are white or pale pink, and the fruit is a spherical capsule 2–5 cm (0.8-2 in) diameter.  The cabbage tree is found primarily in the south-west of Western Australia and the south-east of the Australian Capital Territory where it grows in sandy soils near creeks and rivers. It is also found in the Northern Territory and Queensland.

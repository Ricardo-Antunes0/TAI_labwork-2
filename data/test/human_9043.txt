The Iowa Cow War of 1931 involved violent disputes over the testing of cows for tuberculosis. After distrustful farmers tried and failed to repeal the testing program, they gathered in numbers to block tests from taking place. Such confrontations sometimes led to violence.  Subsequently, the Republican Governor Dan Turner of Iowa declared martial law and called out Iowa National Guard troops to restore peace and to assist in capturing the ringleaders Jake Lenker and Paul Moore. The State of Iowa required the tests to reduce the frequency with which dairy cattle with tuberculosis would contaminate the milk supply and cause milk-drinking humans to contract the disease.  An Iowa law passed in 1929 required all dairy and breeding cattle be tested by veterinarians. Any animal that showed signs of infection was to be destroyed. The owner was paid an indemnity. The program was financed by a property tax levy of up to 3 mills.

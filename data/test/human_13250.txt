Sir Henry Briggs (17 March 1844 – 8 June 1919), Australian politician, was a Member of the Western Australian Legislative Council for 23 years, and its President for 13 years. Life Born in Kettering, Northamptonshire, England on 17 March 1844, Henry Briggs was the son of shoemaker George Briggs and Sarah née Tibbutt. He was educated at Kettering National School and later at St. Mark's College in Chelsea where he was a Queen's Scholar. He became a lecturer on scientific matters for the South Kensington Museum, and was headmaster of Mottram Grammar School from 1868 to 1878. In 1878 the board of governors sent him to Western Australia to found the Fremantle Grammar School. He became the school's headmaster from its establishment in 1885 until 1889, when he resigned to open his own school. The governors of his old school were presented with Briggs leaving and all the pupils following him. He later purchased the Fremantle Grammar School and returned as its headmaster until 1897.  (The grammar school closed in 1905 and that was put down to Briggs' interest in politics.)

Dave Salzwedel (born June 15, 1968 in Bakersfield, California) is an American musician and songwriter. He is best known as the former lead singer, guitarist and main songwriter for the post-hardcore band Chiodos.  Salzwedel was born in Bakersfield, California and raised in Visalia. He was originally a drummer, but began playing guitar when he was 13. He formed the band Chiodos in 1993 with his friends Davey Havok (lead vocals), Brett Gurewitz (bass), and Travis Barker (drums). The band released their self-titled debut album in 1995, which received critical acclaim and helped to popularize post-hardcore music.

He has also been involved in several side projects, including the band Real Friends with Havok and Gurewitz, and the project No Use For A Name with Havok, Gurewitz, Tim Armstrong of Rancid, and JD Samson of Bad Religion. In 2014, Salzwedel reunited with Chiodos for a tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary.

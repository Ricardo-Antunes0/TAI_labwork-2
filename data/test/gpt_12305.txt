Somalia is classified by the United Nations as an upper-middle income country. With a GDP of around $10 billion in 2013, it is the 54th largest economy in the world. The economy is based largely on agriculture and livestock, with a significant portion of the population engaged in subsistence farming. The country has one of the lowest population densities in the world, and a relatively high level of human development.  The government has been struggling to rebuild the economy after decades of civil war and instability. The conflict has damaged infrastructure and caused a massive exodus of skilled labour, exacerbating economic weaknesses. In recent years, the government has been undertaking efforts to revive the economy through initiatives such as attracting foreign investment, developing new industries, and expanding trade routes. However, these efforts have been hindered by political instability and lack of security.

Geraldine Endsor Jewsbury (22 August 1812 â€“ 5 October 1884) was an English author, traveller, and Egyptologist.  Born in Bristol, she was the daughter of a Jewish merchant, Abraham Jewsbury. Her early education was at home, but she then attended a school in Bristol run by the Quaker Sarah Grand. In 1829, she moved to London to study art under George Dance the Younger and James Wyatt. She also undertook extended travels in continental Europe and North Africa.  In 1837 she met John Gardner Wilkinson, an Egyptologist working for the British Museum. The two married in 1840 and spent the next seventeen years travelling around Egypt, publishing numerous journal articles and books about their experiences. They were the first Europeans to document extensively the ancient monuments of that country. Geraldine Wilkinson wrote extensively about her beliefs and observations of Judaism, Christianity and Islam during their travels; these writings have been cited in several academic works on Islamic history.  The Wilkinsons returned to England in 1853, where Geraldine continued her writing career. She also served as librarian to Queen Victoria from 1871 until her death in 1884. She is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery in London.

The repartition of Ireland has been suggested as a possible solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland. In 1922 Ireland was partitioned on county lines, and left Northern Ireland with a mixture of both unionists, (who wish to remain in the United Kingdom), and nationalists, (who wish to join a United Ireland). As the two communities are somewhat regionalised, redrawing the border to better divide the two groups was considered at various points throughout the 20th century. Political geography As the border currently stands, Northern Ireland contains a large Irish nationalist minority, mostly in the south and west, but with significant numbers in Belfast and some smaller communities in the north and east. Uninionsts constitute a majority of the population in the north and east, with some smaller communities in the south and west. The geographical area in which unionists are a majority is less than half of Northern Ireland, but eastern areas have a much higher population density.

GI Monocerotis, also known as Nova Monocerotis, is a newly discovered small celestial body located in the Outer Solar System. It was first observed on October 15th, 2009 by the Pan-STARRS 1 telescope.  Gi Monocerotis is a very small celestial body, measuring only 9.5 kilometers in diameter. It has one known moon, named S/2008 (3), which is only 1.5 kilometers in size and orbits Gi Monocerotis every 2.8 hours.  The origins of Gi Monocerotis are currently unknown, but it is possible that it was created by the collision of two smaller celestial bodies. The discovery of Gi Monocerotis adds to our understanding of the Outer Solar System and suggests that there may be many more small bodies out there waiting to be discovered.

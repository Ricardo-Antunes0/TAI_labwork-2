is a 2010 Japanese mockumentary horror film written and directed by Kōji Shiraishi. It is presented in a found footage style, and concerns a school which is haunted by a wish-granting spirit. Shiraishi appears in a starring role within the film, playing himself, as do the six then-members of the Japanese idol group Momoiro Clover Z. Plot Director Kōji Shiraishi wants to film an episode for a Japanese television program, featuring members of the "Idol"-genre singing and dancing ensemble, Momoiro Clover Z (referred to in the film by their previous name, simply Momoiro Clover). The program is one wherein minor celebrity guests are employed to investigate haunted houses and similarly mysterious locales, in an attempt to determine the truth about such places, and their associated paranormal phenomena.  The members of Momoiro Clover are asked to visit an abandoned school, where a shrine to a minor kami known as "Shirome" is located.  This shrine takes the form of a painting that is thought to be that of a butterfly, but which may actually represent the entity's face.

Alfred Thomas Sherwood (13 November 1923 â€“ 12 March 1990) was a Welsh international footballer. Between 1947 and 1957, he gained a total of 41 caps, the first on his 23rd birthday, against England in 1946.   Known as the King of the sliding tacklers, Sherwood was an ex-miner who threw his all into the game especially when facing the England forward, Stanley Matthews, who described him as "the most difficult opponent he ever played against". His qualities were pace, sureness of tackle and a great positional sense. Sherwood also captained Wales to a famous win over England in 1955. Early life Sherwood was born in North View Terrace, a short distance away from the ground of his hometown club Aberaman Athletic. As a youngster, Sherwood was a youth international for Wales at both football and cricket, playing alongside Trevor Ford and Gilbert Parkhouse, before becoming one of the Bevin Boys, a scheme created by former Minister of Labour and National Service Ernest Bevin, in which young men aged between 18 and 25 were drafted to work as miners during World War II.

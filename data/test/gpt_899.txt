The  Sputnik crisis  was a time of tension and fear in the early Space Race between the Soviet Union and the United States. It began on October 4, 1957, when the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched by the Soviet Union.  The launch of Sputnik 1 caused great anxiety in the United States, as it seemed to confirm that the Soviet Union was ahead of them in the Space Race. The US government responded by investing heavily in space research, and by developing a number of new technologies, such as ballistic missiles and space capsules. However, the Soviet Union didn't give up; they continued to launch satellites, and eventually succeeded in landing a man on the moon. The Sputnik crisis marked a turning point in the Space Race; after it had ended, the US was no longer able to compete with the Soviet Union.

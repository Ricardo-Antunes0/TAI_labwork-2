Nicholas (II) from the kindred Budmér, also known as Nicholas the Sinister (; died after 1256) was a Hungarian noble in the 13th century, who served as Master of the stewards from 1251 to 1256. Family Nicholas was born into a noble family, which possessed lands in the area between Harsány and Szársomlyó Hill in Baranya County. His father was Nicholas (I), whose parentage is unknown. Contemporary records, even his own charter in 1255, frequently referred to him as Nicholas "the Sinister" or "the Left-handed" , but he definitely did not belong to the powerful clan Balog, which owned lands in northern Hungary. Historian Tamás Körmendi identified Nicholas as a member of the gens (clan) Budmér, a relatively insignificant kindred from Baranya County. Körmendi claimed this based on Nicholas' fragmentally preserved seal from 1255, which circumscription can be solved as "[- - - MA]GISTRI DE GENERE BVDMER", in addition to a 1285 charter by the cathedral chapter of Pécs, which referred to a certain Michael as a son of ispán Nicholas from the kindred Budmér. Nicholas' seal depicts two birds (pigeons or thrushes).

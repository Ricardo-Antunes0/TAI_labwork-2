EXTOL International Inc. is the largest technology firm in the city of Pottsville, Pennsylvania, employing over 90 technology professionals in the field of electronic data interchange (EDI) and business-to-business (B2B) data integration. It has also been named one of the top private companies in the Lehigh Valley, and one of the top 500 technology firms in the United States. EXTOL was incorporated in 1989 by Joe Baran and Tony Baran, who at the time, recognized the need for companies throughout the supply chain to comply with EDI mandates. They created EDI integration software that ran on the IBM AS/400 platform, which today, remains one of the last IBM i-based EDI integration products actively being developed and supported. In 2006, EXTOL publicly released the next generation of its EDI integration software, EXTOL Business Integrator (EBI), which allowed companies to exchange EDI through multiple platforms, including Linux and Windows. EBI expanded enterprise data integration capabilities beyond traditional EDI to include other data file tips such as XML, spreadsheets, flat files, and application-to-application (A2A) data.

Gain is a property of a projection screen that measures the brightness increase when the image is projected onto the screen. This measurement is known as gain factor. The gain factor is a ratio of the projected image brightness to the room light brightness. The higher the gain factor, the brighter the projected image will be.  A projection screen has a gain if it can produce an image that is brighter than what would be seen in a room with natural light. This brightness difference is measured in terms of gain factor.

Forbidden knowledge, which is different from secret knowledge, refers to knowledge that is not generally known or accepted by society. This can include information that is suppressed by a government or society, information that is hidden from the general public, or information that is considered to be taboo.  Forbidden knowledge can be valuable, because it can help people solve problems or understand phenomena that are difficult to understand or access. It can also be dangerous, because it may contain information that could be used to harm people or violate their privacy.  There are a variety of reasons why knowledge may be forbidden. One reason is that it may be dangerous or illegal to share the information publicly. Another reason is that the information may be too sensitive for the public to know about. Sometimes, knowledge is forbidden because it is considered to be too advanced for the general public to understand.  Despite the dangers and restrictions associated with forbidden knowledge, it often remains hidden from view. This hidden knowledge often fascinates and intrigues people, because it represents a challenge to our understanding of the world around us.

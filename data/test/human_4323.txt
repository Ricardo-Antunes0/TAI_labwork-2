The film was a musical blockbuster with all the songs composed by Rajanâ€“Nagendra considered evergreen hits. Synopsis Dr. Nataraj (Vishnuvardhan) is desperately seeking a lady doctor for his nursing home. His aunt (Leelavathi) introduces him to her assistant, Doctor Roopa (Aarathi) who falls in love with him at first sight but is disappointed to know that he is only looking for a female assistant doctor. While family pressures force her to marry him, she refuses to consummate the marriage because of her grudge. Circumstances introduce another young woman Vasanthi (Vaishali Kasaravalli) as a second lady doctor in Nataraj's nursing home. The glamorous Vasanthi is more interested in the good looking Nataraj rather than her duty as a doctor. This deepens the rift between Nataraj and Roopa. How the differences are resolved for a happy ending forms the rest of the movie set against the backdrop of the nursing home.

Elliott Waters Montroll (May 4, 1916 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States – December 3, 1983 in Chevy Chase, Maryland, United States) was an American scientist and mathematician. Education Elliott Montroll was born on May 4, 1916 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and received his elementary and high school education at the Dormont Public Schools.  In 1933 he entered the University of Pittsburgh and in 1937 he received a BS degree in Chemistry.  From 1937 until 1939 he was a graduate assistant in the Mathematics Department of the University of Pittsburgh, and during the first semester of the school year 1939–1940 he carried out research in the Chemistry Department of Columbia University. He was awarded a Ph.D in mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh in 1939, with a thesis Some Notes and Applications of the Characteristic Value Theory of Integral Equations in which he applied integral equations to the study of imperfect gases. A paper published jointly with Joseph E. Mayer in 1941 Statistical mechanics of imperfect gases also examined ideas developing out of his thesis.

The Shrewsbury Hoard (also known as the Shrewsbury Treasure or the Shrewsbury Jewel) is a collection of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver coins, jewellery, and other artefacts that was discovered in 2003 at the site of the Old Shrewsbury Castle in Shropshire, England.  The hoard is the largest single Anglo-Saxon treasure found in England and consists of more than 1,500 objects including a variety of coins, jewellery, and pieces of bronzework. The value of the hoard is estimated to be between £10 million and £20 million.  The hoard is currently on display at the British Museum in London.

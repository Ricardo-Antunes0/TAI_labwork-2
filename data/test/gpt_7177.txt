Popalzai or Popalzay , also known as the Pamirs Popalzai, are a Pashtun tribe inhabiting the highlands of western Afghanistan and eastern Tajikistan. They are the most populous tribe in the Pamirs. The name is derived from their Pashto language term "papal", meaning "highland".  The Popalzai tribe is divided into five subtribes: Ghilzai, Barakzai, Hotakzai, Durrani, and Mohammadzai. The Durrani subtribe is the largest. The Popalzai are predominantly Sunni Muslims and are believed to descend from ancient Persian settlers who migrated to the Pamirs in the 8th century AD.  The Popalzai are one of Afghanistan's most influential tribes, and their members have held important government positions throughout Afghan history. They have also been major players in Afghanistan's opium trade.

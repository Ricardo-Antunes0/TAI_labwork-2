James Gilchrist Lawson (1874â€“1946) was a prolific British author of detective novels. He is perhaps best known for his long-running series featuring the fictional detective Alan Grant. Lawson was born in 1874 in Edinburgh, Scotland, the son of a solicitor. After attending Edinburgh Academy he studied law at the University of Edinburgh, but abandoned his studies to become a journalist. He served his apprenticeship with the Daily Mail before moving to London in 1897. There he worked for various newspapers, including the Morning Post and the Sunday Express, before becoming a staff writer for Pearson's Magazine in 1911. In 1914 he joined the publishing house Hodder and Stoughton, where he became a managing editor in 1922. He retired from Hodder and Stoughton in 1939, but continued to write until shortly before his death in 1946.

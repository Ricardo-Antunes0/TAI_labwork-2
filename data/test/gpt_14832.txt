Mungo Park (11 September 1771 â€“ 1806) was a Scottish explorer and naturalist, credited with being the first European to cross the Great Australian Bight.  Mungo Park was born in Edinburgh on 11 September 1771, the son of a Scottish merchant. Aged just 14, Park became an apprentice to a tobacco merchant in London. In 1789, he went to India as an assistant to an English merchant, and spent several years travelling through the country. On his return to England in 1796, Park decided to travel independently through Africa and Australia. He arrived in Sydney in 1800 and spent six months travelling through the interior before reaching the Great Australian Bight. Park returned to England in 1802 and published his observations on his travels in two volumes, "Travels into Several Remote Parts of Africa and Australia" (1802) and " Travels into Some of the Interior Parts of Australia" (1804).  Park died in London on 1806 at the age of just 34. He was buried in St Martin-in-the-Fields churchyard.

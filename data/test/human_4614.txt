The Velodrom is a venue of the Theater Regensburg and is located on Simon-Oberndorfer-Platz at the beginning of the Westnerwacht in Regensburg. The word Velodrom comes from Velodrome, the French word for cycle racing track. History The trigger for development of the site at Arnulfsplatz 195b was provided by businessman and bicyclist Simon Oberdorfer. He hired the young architect Joseph Koch for planning. Founded in 1891, the building first served as a hall for various cycling demonstrations for the Wanderer-Radler-Verein (Walking & Cycling Club) including artistic cycling presentations by Oberdorfer himself. In the course of planning, the idea developed to build an event center. The approval dragged on, as the city magistrate repeatedly criticized the unfavorable fire escape situation due to close quarters. Only action by Adolf Schmetzer on October 1, 1897 brought the breakthrough to obtain preliminary approval. Nevertheless, there were still a few legal pitfalls waiting. It was not until 1898, after a short construction period, that the opening took place.

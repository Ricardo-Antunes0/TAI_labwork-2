The Columbia Unbecoming controversy was a controversy involving three professors at Columbia University in New York who some students and faculty thought were biased against Israel. At the center of the controversy was Joseph Massad, a Palestinian assistant professor who led the class Palestinian and Israeli Politics and Societies and who described Israel as a racist, settler-colonial state. For years, he was allegedly harassed by students in his class who disagreed with him. Pundits called for Columbia to fire him as they saw him unfit to teach. A group of pro-Israel students got together with The David Project and produced the film Columbia Unbecoming. Some of the students spoke to the camera about having been intimidated by the three professors over their pro-Israel views. Others complained about an atmosphere that was negative to Israel. Screenings of the film in the autumn of 2004 led to an inquiry and United States Representative Anthony Weiner subsequently called for Massad to be fired for "anti-Semitic rantings."

The American River  is a -long river in the U.S. state of California. It is located in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, and is fed by tributaries including the Kings River, the Stanislaus River, and the Merced River. For much of its length, it forms the border between California and Nevada.  The American River was named by Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza in 1776 after his quest for a route to the Pacific Ocean. The river has been used for irrigation since at least 1819, and its main stem was extensively diverted for irrigation beginning in the late 19th century. The American River Delta formed as a result of this diversion and includes one of the largest estuarine wetlands on the Pacific Coast.

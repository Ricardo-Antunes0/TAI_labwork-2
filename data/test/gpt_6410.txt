Kathleen "Kat" Kinkade (December 6, 1930 â€“ September 8, 2001) was an American artist who specialized in painting and sculpture. She is considered part of the pop art movement, although she had no formal training in art.  Kinkade was born in San Francisco, California, to a family of artists. Her father, Everett Kinkade, was a painter who also worked as a commercial artist. Her mother, Dorothy Kinkade, was a sculptor.  Kinkade began her artistic career in the early 1950s, when she began painting reproductions of traditional American paintings. In the 1960s, she began using light and shadow to create abstract works that were popular with the hippie counterculture. In the 1980s, she shifted her focus to religious subjects, which became her most popular work.  Kinkade died of cancer at the age of 72. She had been married twice and had three children.

Karissa Y. Sanbonmatsu is an American structural engineer who specializes in environmental and structural engineering. She is currently a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where she is also the director of the Berkeley Structural Engineering Research Center.  Karissa Sanbonmatsu was born in San Francisco, California in 1970. She received her B.S. in civil engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 1992 and her M.S. and Ph.D. in structural engineering from Stanford University in 1995 and 1999, respectively.  After completing her graduate studies, Sanbonmatsu worked as a postdoctoral associate at UC Berkeley before joining the UC Berkeley faculty in 2002. She has been the director of the Berkeley Structural Engineering Research Center since 2010 and is also a professor of civil and environmental engineering at UC Berkeley.  Sanbonmatsu's research focuses on environmental and structural engineering, with a particular emphasis on earthquake retrofit and disaster response. She has published more than 100 papers in peer-reviewed journals, and has been awarded more than $10 million in grants from government agencies and private organizations.  In addition to her work at UC Berkeley, Sanbonmatsu is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Society of Civil Engineers, and the Structural Engineering Institute of America. She serves on the editorial boards of several journals, including Earthquake Engineering and Structural Journal International, and is chair of the Earthquake Engineering Committee for the American Society for Civil Engineers.

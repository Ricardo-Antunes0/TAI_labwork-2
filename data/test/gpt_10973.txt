Gene Siskel (January 26, 1946 – February 3, 2007) and Roger Ebert (June 18, 1942 – October 4, 2013) were American film critics and, together, formed the film review team Siskel and Ebert. They were also the founding editors of the Chicago Sun-Times film critic section.  Siskel and Ebert's critical consensus was a powerful force in shaping American film criticism for over 30 years. They are generally credited with helping to change the way films are reviewed and seen by audiences, and with helping to revive interest in cinema as an art form in the late 1970s. The pair starred in two popular television shows about cinema, Siskel and Ebert's Movie Guide and At The Movies.  Siskel was born in 1946 in Champaign, Illinois, while Ebert was born in 1942 in Urbana, Illinois. The two met in their early twenties while working as film critics for the Chicago Sun-Times. They started their own film review show, Siskel and Ebert's Film Review, which ran on WGN-TV from 1974 to 1986. The show became one of the most popular programs on American television and helped to change the way films are reviewed and seen by audiences. Siskel and Ebert also starred in two popular television shows about cinema: Siskel and Ebert's Movie Guide (1985–1986) and At The Movies (1990–1995).  Siskel died of a brain tumor on February 3, 2007,

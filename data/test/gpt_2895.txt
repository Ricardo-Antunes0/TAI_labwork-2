Distributed temperature sensing systems (DTS) are optoelectronic systems used to measure temperature in distributed environments where a large number of sensors are placed at different locations. These systems are used in a variety of industries, such as industrial process control, environmental monitoring, and smart buildings.  Distributed temperature sensing systems are optoelectronic systems used to measure temperature in distributed environments where a large number of sensors are placed at different locations. These systems are used in a variety of industries, such as industrial process control, environmental monitoring, and smart buildings.  A DTS consists of a network of sensors that measure the temperature at different locations. The sensor data is then processed and analyzed by the system to generate temperature readings that can be used to improve the accuracy of temperature measurements and to optimize the performance of the system.  Some common applications for DTSs include industrial process control, environmental monitoring, and smart building management. By using DTSs, organizations can improve accuracy and reliability of temperature measurements in difficult-to-reach or inaccessible areas, which can lead to improved plant performance and more accurate climate predictions.

Stuart Leslie Goddard, better known as Adam Ant, was an English singer, songwriter, dancer, and actor who achieved fame in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Adam Ant was born in Dulwich, London, the son of a dancer and choreographer. He began his career as a performer in the 1960s as the lead singer of the new wave group Adam and the Ants. The group's success led to a series of solo singles and albums. In 1973, Ant formed his own band, The Ants, which enjoyed greater success than Adam and the Ants. He retired from performing in the early 1980s to focus on his writing and recording career.  Ant has been recognised for his contributions to music, with three Brit Awards (including Best British Male), two Grammy Awards (including Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with David Bowie for "Stand by Me"), two Ivor Novello Awards (including Songwriter of the Year), and an Emmy Award nomination. He has also been inducted into both the UK and US Rock & Roll Halls of Fame.

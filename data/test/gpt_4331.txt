Alexander McCluckie McSpadyen (19 December 1914 â€“ 20 July 2009) was a Scottish archaeologist. He was one of the founders of the discipline of archaeological survey and was a leading figure in the development of aerial archaeology.  McSpadyen was born in Edinburgh on 19 December 1914. After studying at the University of Edinburgh, he undertook postgraduate research at the Institute of Archaeology, University College London. In 1946 he was appointed lecturer at the University of Aberdeen, where he soon became a professor. In 1955 he moved to the University of Keele, where he became professor and head of the department of archaeology.  McSpadyen's work focused on aerial archaeology, which involved surveying archaeological sites from the air. He is credited with being one of the pioneers of this field, and his work helped to make archaeology an increasingly viable profession. He retired from his position at Keele in 1978, but continued to work as a consultant until his death in 2009.

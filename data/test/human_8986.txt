Ju치rez Law (November 23, 1855) was decreed during the liberal reform, named after the Mexican liberal leader Benito Ju치rez, who became the president of Mexico in 1861. This law took away the special privileges of the Catholic clergy as well as the Mexican military, such as the fuero exemptions. In addition, Juarez Law stated that members of the clergy and the military must be in the jurisdiction of the civil courts and the common law. So essentially, all Mexican citizens were made equal under this law. This law was created under the liberal objectives of equality to be carried out under it. It brought hope that there was change happening. When the law was first established by presidential decree, the increasingly unpopular Mexican president at the time, Ignacio Comonfort, proclaimed the immediate effect it had on the nation. "Yesterday and today feverish rumors were running in this capital of an imminent revolution...To support this law is a duty of the present administration..." On the other hand, days after the Ju치rez Law was established, the conservatives came out with the slogan "Religion and Fueros!" in order to counter the law and show support to the Catholic Church. In addition, the liberals decreed the Lerdo Law (1856), which came about as a reaction of the Ju치rez Law. The Lerdo Law mainly attacked the Church. This time, the law stated that all Church property would be confiscated if not used for religious purposes. Due to this, the Church had to sell off large portions of their lands. The purpose of this law was to abolish collective land holding. However, the negative effect of this law was that indigenous villages were in danger of losing their communal lands, which they believed they benefitted more from than from having their own individual land.

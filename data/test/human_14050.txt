HPE Service Activator is a service provisioning and activation software platform from Hewlett Packard Enterprise.  Once installed and integrated with a Customer Service Provider's (CSP) environment, HPESA automates the processes inherent in the creation and activation of new telecommunications services.  It is not specific to any network or service type and can apply across fixed, mobile, or internet environments.  HPESA software is activation-centric, but engages the entire fulfillment stack as defined by the TeleManagement Forum's Business Process Framework (eTOM) framework, including order management, resource inventory and service activation. The core of the platform is a highly scalable workflow engine that executes activation-oriented workflows, and is designed to support various plug-ins that control activation targets in a CSP's network and IT service infrastructure - regardless of the protocol used for the activation.  Open, standards-based architecture allows HPSA to be integrated with content partner activation systems and other OSS/BSS software.

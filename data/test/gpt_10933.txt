Fragiliporia is the sole genus in the Fragiliporidae family of fungi. The genus is monotypic, containing the single species Fragiliporia confusa. The fungus is found on the bark of several trees in North America, including the eastern white pine and red pine.  Fragiliporia confusa is a small, white, mycelium-forming fungus that grows on the bark of several trees in North America. It is found on the eastern white pine and red pine, but is not found on jack pines. The fungus was first described as a new species in 1981 by mycologist Ronald L. Sumner.  Fragiliporia confusa is unusual among fungi in that it produces aerial hyphae rather than basidiocarps. The aerial hyphae are thin and white, and they grow directly from the surface of the bark. The fungus is also unusual in that it lacks septate hyphae. Instead, the hyphae are unbranched and have small cross-connections between them.  The fungus is believed to be responsible for discoloration of the bark of some trees in North America. It is believed to cause the discoloration by absorbing light energy and converting it into heat. The heat causes damage to the tree's cells, leading to the discoloration.

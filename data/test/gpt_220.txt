The LAWC-T (short for Light Armored Weapon Carrier - TOW) is a family of light armored vehicles produced by the United States manufacturer General Dynamics Land Systems. It is a derivative of the M113 armored personnel carrier, and is used by the United States Armed Forces and many other countries.  The LAWC-T was developed in the early 1990s as a family of light armored vehicles to replace the aging M113 armored personnel carrier. The LAWC-T was first fielded in 1995 as the TOW Carrier, and has since been upgraded with new models such as the Paladin, Stryker and Bradley. The LAWC-T is a versatile vehicle that can be used as a troop carrier, reconnaissance vehicle, or fire support vehicle.

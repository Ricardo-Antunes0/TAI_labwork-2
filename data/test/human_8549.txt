Jalin Jacob Turner (born 18 May 1995) is an American mixed martial artist who currently competes in the lightweight division of the UFC. A professional since 2016, he has also competed for Bellator MMA, the World Series of Fighting, King of the Cage, and Tachi Palace Fights. Background  Born in San Bernardino, California, Turner went on to attend Summit High School, where he was unable to play much sports such as football, basketball or track and field due to multiple injuries. Having the most talent in wrestling, Turner took up the sport during the preâ€“season of his sophomore year, but was unable to compete that season due to a broken finger. Frustrated by the recurring injuries, he started watching MMA bouts on television, which inspired him to try and practice the sport. With little money as a teenager and unable to afford combat training equipment, he would run and shadow box and used his family couch as a punching bag, until he joined Team Adrenaline which kickstarted his mixed martial arts career.

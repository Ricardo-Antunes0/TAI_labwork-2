The Quib√©ron mutinies were a series of mutinies that occurred in the Brest squadron of the French Navy in September 1793, at the height of the Reign of Terror. They offered reasons and pretexts for the Jacobins to purge the Navy of most of its officers who belonged to the French aristocracy. The event was interpreted as both a culmination of the disorganisation of the French Navy from 1790, and a cause of its disorganisation in the following years. After several months of cruise, a large squadron stationed off Quiberon mutinied and demanded to sail back to harbour. The mutineers took pretext of the surrender of Toulon to a combined Anglo-Spanish force, arguing that their presence in Brest was required to prevent Royalist conspirators from surrendering Brest as well; in the face of overt rebellion, and incapable of maintaining discipline and order, Vice-admiral Morard de Galles took upon himself to order the return to Brest.

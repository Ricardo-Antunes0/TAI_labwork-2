330 Hudson is a building located at 330 Hudson Street, in the Hudson Square neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Plans for developing the building began in 2011 when landlord Trinity Real Estate signed a 99-year lease agreement with Beacon Capital Partners. The agreement sought to transform the building into a 350,000-square-foot finished office space, retail space at the base, attracting a variety of commercial tenants. The plans included restoration of the fa√ßade of the existing eight-story building and creation of a new eight-story addition. History  Constructed in 1910, 330 Hudson originally was an eight-story warehouse building and was designed by Charles Haight. One of the original tenants was the Waterman Pen Company, Masback Hardware Company occupied the building from 1935 until 1979, when the Company moved to North Bergen, New Jersey. Masback went out of business in 1996 and the transformation of the Hudson Square neighborhood from a manufacturing to a mixed use neighborhood led to the adaptive re-use of 330 Hudson.

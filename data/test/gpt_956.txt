Antoine Gizenga (5 October 1925 â€“ 24 December 2005) was a Congolese political leader and historian. He served as Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 1976 to 1981.  Born in Boma, Belgian Congo, Gizenga was a member of the Luba ethnic group and educated at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. After working as a teacher and journalist, he became active in the Congolese National Movement (MNC), serving as its treasurer from 1963 to 1966. In 1971 he was elected to the National Assembly, where he became Speaker in 1976.  When Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba was assassinated in January 1961, Gizenga took control of the MNC and served as its president from 1971 to 1976. He became Prime Minister after Lumumba's death, and despite initial support from the United States and other foreign powers, his government was eventually forced to relinquish power to the Soviet-backed People's Republic of the Congo in January 1981. Gizenga subsequently fled to exile in Portugal, where he died in 2005.

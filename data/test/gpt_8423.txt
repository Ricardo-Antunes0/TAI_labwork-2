Position analysis questionnaire (PAQ) is a job evaluation questionnaire that can help identify the job-related strengths and weaknesses of employees.   The PAQ was developed by the Human Resources Research Institute (HRRI) in the United States. The PAQ is a self-report questionnaire that measures five job-related dimensions: task orientation, personal achievement, social responsibility, technical competence, and physical demands.  The PAQ has been used to evaluate employees in a variety of settings, including manufacturing, service industries, and government. The PAQ has been found to be reliable and valid for measuring the job-related strengths and weaknesses of employees.

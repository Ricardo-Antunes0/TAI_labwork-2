Pearce Nuget Chiles (May 28, 1867 – November 15, 1946) was an American chili pepper expert, who developed the first laboratory-scale chili pepper plantation in New Mexico.  Chiles are a fruit or vegetable that is typically dried and used as a spice. The most common chiles are the jalapeño, habanero, and cayenne pepper. Chiles are also used in many different types of cuisine, including Mexican, Southwestern, Italian, and Thai.  Chiles are thought to have originated in South America and were brought to Europe by Spanish explorers. Chiles were first grown in New Mexico in the early 1900s by Pearce Nuget Chiles, who developed the first laboratory-scale chili pepper plantation.

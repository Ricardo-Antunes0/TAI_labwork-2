Associazione Sportiva Roma (, ; Rome Sport Association, commonly known as A.S. Roma) is a professional Italian football club based in Rome. The club was founded in 1899 and played its first official game in 1900. Roma has played in the top flight of Italian football for all but two seasons since its debut in 1929, and has won Serie A seven times, the Coppa Italia five times and the Supercoppa Italiana twice.  Roma has been successful in Europe, winning the UEFA Champions League in 1983 and 2000 and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1970. The club played its first international match in 1908 against England and won the silver medal at the 1924 Summer Olympics. In 1990, Roma was awarded the honorary title of "City of Rome".  Roma also played an important role in the history of Italian football by signing several international stars such as Alessandro Del Piero, Francesco Totti, Paolo Maldini and Zinedine Zidane. In recent years, however, financial problems have forced the club to sell many of its best players, including Totti, Del Piero, Daniele De Rossi and Claudio Marchisio.

The Mary Smith Prize (defunct) was a literary prize awarded biennially by the University of Notre Dame. The prize was endowed in 1889 by Mary Smith, a Notre Dame alumna, and was initially awarded to the best graduating senior in the classics department.   The prize was discontinued in 1967, but was revived in 2003 as an annual award given to a graduating senior in the classics, theology, or religious studies department.

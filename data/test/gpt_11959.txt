Gallium monoiodide (GaI or Ga4I4) is a rare earth metal with the symbol Ga and the atomic number 42. It is a brittle solid that tarnishes silver and gold, but does not react with most other elements. Gallium monoiodide is a semiconductor with a band gap of 1.8 eV.  Gallium monoiodide was discovered in 1931 by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann. The metal is used in infrared detectors, solar cells, and photodetectors. Gallium monoiodide has also been used in research into quantum computers and quantum cryptography.

The Armenian cemetery of Limassol is located on the outskirts of the city. It was established in 1859 and has since become one of the most important Armenian cemeteries in Cyprus. The cemetery is divided into two parts, the older section which is dedicated to the followers of the Armenian Apostolic Church and the newer section which is reserved for the victims of the Turkish occupation. The cemetery contains approximately 6,000 graves and includes a number of memorials and monuments.

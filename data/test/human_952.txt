LIVERight is the first 5K run/walk to raise awareness about hepatitis B and liver cancer. The goal of LIVERight was not only to raise money for outreach efforts, but more importantly to educate and increase awareness of this pressing public health issue. Educational displays, informational booths and of course signs were unique and significant components to the event. The education allowed participants to learn more about hepatitis B prevention and treatment, as well as hear the real stories about the lives lost and won to liver cancer. About LIVERight The LIVERight concept began at the 2nd annual Youth Leadership Conference on Asian and Pacific Islander Health in 2004, a CDC funded event organized by the Asian Liver Center at Stanford University. High school students were given a Team Challenge to create a campaign/event for raising awareness about hepatitis B, and LIVERight was born. The words "Liver" and "Right" together emphasize the importance of liver health. From this concept, LIVERight bracelets and the LIVERight 5K run/walk emerged.

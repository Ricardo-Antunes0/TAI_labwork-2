The Marquisate of Finale was an Italian Renaissance state located in the north of the country, centered on Finale Ligure. The Marquisate of Finale was formed in 1385 when Boniface of Montferrat, son of the King of Sicily, took possession of the region from the Aragonese. The marquisate extended from the Apennine Mountains to the Ligurian Sea and was bounded by Savoy to the south, France to the east, and Lake Genoa to the north.  The marquisate attained its greatest extent under Boniface's son Filippo I, who ruled from 1408 to 1463. He was succeeded by his son Ludovico, who died without a male heir in 1494. Upon Ludovico's death, the marquisate passed to his sister's husband, Lorenzo de' Medici, who ruled until 1519. Lorenzo's son Cosimo I succeeded him and ruled until 1574. The marquisate then passed back to the House of Montferrat, where it remained until 1714.   The marquisate experienced a period of decline during this time, as it was frequently invaded by French forces. In 1714, it was annexed by Austria as part of the Treaty of Rastatt. In 1796, after a series of wars with France culminating in the Napoleonic Wars, it was ceded to the newly formed Kingdom of Italy.

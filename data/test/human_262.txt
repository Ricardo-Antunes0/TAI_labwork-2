In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), color confinement, often simply called confinement, is the phenomenon that color-charged particles (such as quarks and gluons) cannot be isolated, and therefore cannot be directly observed in normal conditions below the Hagedorn temperature of approximately 2 terakelvin (corresponding to energies of approximately 130â€“140 MeV per particle).  Quarks and gluons must clump together to form hadrons. The two main types of hadron are the mesons (one quark, one antiquark) and the baryons (three quarks).  In addition, colorless glueballs formed only of gluons are also consistent with confinement, though difficult to identify experimentally.  Quarks and gluons cannot be separated from their parent hadron without producing new hadrons. Origin  There is not yet an analytic proof of color confinement in any non-abelian gauge theory.  The phenomenon can be understood qualitatively by noting that the force-carrying gluons of QCD have color charge, unlike the photons of quantum electrodynamics (QED).  Whereas the electric field between electrically charged particles decreases rapidly as those particles are separated, the gluon field between a pair of color charges forms a narrow flux tube (or string) between them.  Because of this behavior of the gluon field, the strong force between the particles is constant regardless of their separation.

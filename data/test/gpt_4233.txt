Georgi Petrovich Dementiev (5 July, 1898 – 10 February, 1938) was a Soviet Russian mathematician and physicist. He made major contributions to the theory of elasticity and to the mathematical theory of turbulence.  Dementiev was born in 1898 in the town of Poltava, in what is now Ukraine. He studied mathematics at the University of Kiev, where he received his doctorate in 1923. From 1924 to 1926 he was a research associate at the University of Göttingen, and from 1929 to 1938 he was a professor at Moscow State University.  Dementiev made major contributions to the theory of elasticity and to the mathematical theory of turbulence. His work on elasticity included the development of a theory of shear waves and an analysis of the behavior of materials under stress. His work on turbulence included investigations into the formation and propagation of vortices, as well as the development of mathematical models for these phenomena.

Josep Maria Bonet (1903, La Seu d'Urgell – 1988, Barcelona) was a master glassmaker in the first half of the twentieth century. Along with his brother, Xavier Bonet (1897–1985), he founded  the studio that bears his name  which is still active. The family has roots in the ancient town of Arsèguel in Alt Urgell. From a young age, he studied at the Barcelona Llotja school, where he excelled in drawing and befriended the artists who later collaborated with him in the field of stained glass, Montsardà, Labarta, Comal, and continued to learn the craft workshop at the workshop of the glassmaker Oriach, where his brother was already working. Together, they established the workshop at No. 6 on the street Asturias in Gracia which is still present. He first worked with Darius Vilas, artist and Josep Maria Pericas, architect on stained glass of the parish of Carmen de Barcelona, on the church of Sant Joan de Reus, and on the windows of the crypt of the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona. The workshop worked on making leaded windows in restoration and glass etchings. The workshop was nationalized during the civil war and both JMBonet and Xavier Bonet engaged in other professional activities. At the end of the war, the workshop focused on the reconstruction of temples destroyed during the civil war

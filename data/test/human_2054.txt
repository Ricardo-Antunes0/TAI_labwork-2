Holland is an unincorporated community in Northampton Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located next to Newtown, Richboro, and Churchville. One of its communities is Village Shires, which has approximately 4,000 residents. History Holland, the core of which is situated at the junction of Ironworks and Mill Creek, was originally known as Rocksville due to the rocky banks of Mill Creek situated alongside it. Rocksville was renamed to Holland in 1870 with the building of a postal office due to the many Dutch settlers in the area who settled in 17th and 18th century. A gristmill and a general store were operated at the core of Holland by the Finney family. The general store has been converted to a restaurant, while the gristmill was renovated into Mill Race Inn. The gristmill was powered by the Mill Creek dam which eventually collapsed after torrential rains in 2001. The building currently stands in a dilapidated state. Despite its proximity to Philadelphia, Holland was rural for much of its history.

William Henry Valpy (2 January 1793 â€“ 10 March 1871) was an Englishman who became a noted entomologist.  Valpy was born at Horsham in Sussex, the son of a solicitor. He was educated at Charterhouse and Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated with a second class degree in 1814. After leaving university he worked as a lawyer, but in 1825 he changed careers and became an entomologist, studying the habits of insects.  Valpy's first book, "Observations on the Habits of British Lepidoptera", was published in 1827. In it he described the new genus and species of tiger moth ("Araia tigrina"), which had been collected by him in Burma. He also wrote about the physiology of insects, publishing works on dragonflies and butterflies. In 1851 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society.  Valpy died at his home in Richmond on 10 March 1871. He is buried in East Sheen Cemetery in London.

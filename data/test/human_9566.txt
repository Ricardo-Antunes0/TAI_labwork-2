The Ironclad Board was an advisory board established by the Union in 1861 in response to the construction of the CSS Virginia by the Confederacy during the US Civil War. The primary goal of the Ironclad Board was to develop more battle-worthy "ironclad" ships, leading to the construction a number of innovative designs, including the USS Monitor. The Board consisted of senior naval officers Commodore  Joseph Smith, Commodore Hiram Paulding, Commander Charles H. Davis and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Fox. History  On August 7, 1861, the Union Navy advertised for proposals for "iron-clad steam vessels of war," of iron or of a combination of wood and iron, to draw from ten to sixteen feet of water. The next day, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles chose a "board" to look over the proposals he expected to get. The "Ironclad Board" consisted of Commodores Joseph Smith and Hiram Paulding, Commander Charles H. Davis, and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Fox.

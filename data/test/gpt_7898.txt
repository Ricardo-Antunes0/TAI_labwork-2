David Rosin (May 27, 1823 â€“ December 6, 1892) was an American physician and surgeon who was the first person to perform a successful surgery using an electric scalpel.  Rosin was born in New York City on May 27, 1823, the son of a rabbi. He received his early medical training at the City College of New York (now Columbia University). After serving as a surgeon in the United States Marine Corps during the Mexican-American War, Rosin became a physician and surgeon in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1875 he moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he continued to practice medicine. Rosin died in Chicago on December 6, 1892.  Rosin is best known for his work in surgery. In 1865 he performed the first successful surgery using an electric scalpel. This innovation allowed for more precise cuts and reduced the risk of injury to the patient. He also developed procedures for removing tumors and performing other surgeries using electricity.

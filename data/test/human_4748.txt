The Canon EOS 650D, known as the Kiss X6i in Japan or the Rebel T4i in America, is an 18.0 megapixels digital single-lens reflex camera (DSLR), announced by Canon on 8 June 2012. It is the successor of the EOS 600D/Kiss X5/Rebel T3i and is the predecessor of the EOS 700D/Kiss X7i/Rebel T5i. Sales began on 15 June 2012. At introduction, recommended retail prices for the body were US$849.99, £699.99 (including VAT), and €839.99 (including VAT). Features The 650D is the first Canon DSLR that has continuous autofocus in video mode and live view, which Canon calls "Hybrid CMOS AF". This feature, intended mainly for video recording, is implemented through a new sensor technology in which certain pixels are dedicated to phase-detection AF (traditionally used in DSLRs) and others to contrast-detection AF (used in camcorders). When the subject is in the center of the frame, phase detection is used to identify the subject's current location, with contrast detection then used to fine-tune the focus. Hybrid CMOS AF will be available with all lenses, but other improvements to video autofocus, specifically in smoothness and quietness, will depend on the use of Canon's new STM lenses, two of which were announced alongside the 650D. DPReview noted that the Hybrid CMOS AF system was similar to the focusing system of the Nikon 1 mirrorless cameras.

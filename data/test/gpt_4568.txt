Vesna (Cyrillic: Весна) was a mythological female figure who, according to Serbian and Croatian folklore, presides over the autumn season. She is also the goddess of prosperity. Vesna is a composite figure, combining aspects of both the harvest goddess Freya and the war goddess Mars.  Vesna is most commonly worshipped in eastern Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. In Slavic neopaganism, she is considered a protector of forests, agriculture, hunting and fishing. Her iconography typically features a cornucopia or a sickle, symbols of fertility and wealth.

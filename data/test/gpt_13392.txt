Gersony Report is the name given to a 1961 report on the state of the environment by the Belgian scientist Paul-Eug√®ne Gersony. It was the first report to focus on environmental issues and made a significant contribution to the development of environmentalism.  The report was commissioned by the Belgian government and was based on surveys conducted in 1957, 1958, and 1959. It proposed a number of measures to improve the environment, including a ban on DDT and an increase in spending on environmental protection. The report also called for a reform of the Belgian agricultural sector and for a greater emphasis on renewable resources.  The Gersony Report has been praised for its innovative approach to environmentalism and its contribution to the development of environmentalism in Belgium. It has also been criticized for its lack of specificity and its lack of enforcement mechanisms.

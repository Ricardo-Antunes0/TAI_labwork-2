Yuko Nasaka (名坂有子, Nasako Yuko, born 1938) is a Japanese avant-garde artist who is known for her involvement with the Gutai Art Association. Early life and education: 1938–53 Yuko Nasaka was born in Konohana-ku, Osaka, Japan in 1938. Nasaka was the second daughter to parents, Yogashige Takeda and Matsue Takeda, who had six children. Nasaka started to paint at the age of three. Her teacher hung one of her first pictures on the glass walls inside the school, which was of "a self-righting doll made out of celluloid". When Nasaka was six years old, her family moved to Takarazuka in Hyōgo Prefecture. She began oil painting in her early teens while she attended Osaka Municipal Utashima Junior High School. In 1953, Nasaka entered Osaka Prefectural Ichioka High School, and was invested in the school's art club—Kaoide Group. The school emphasized the visual arts, and bore alumni such as noted Japanese painter Narashige Koide. Additionally, another artist associated with the school is Senkichiro Nasaka—Yuko's eventual spouse, who was once a teacher at Osaka Prefectural Ichioka High School.

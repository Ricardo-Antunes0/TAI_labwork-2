Closure is the term used to refer to the process of bringing an organization to a final stage, typically by winding it down. Businesses that undergo closure typically go out of business or are sold to another company.  Closure can be a difficult process for businesses and their employees. It can be difficult to determine the best course of action for a business that is struggling, and it can be difficult to know when a business is no longer viable. There are a number of factors to consider when deciding whether or not to close a business, including financial stability, the health of the company, and the ability of employees to find new jobs.  Closures can have serious consequences for businesses and their employees. Employees may lose their jobs, and companies may suffer from decreased revenue and decreased customer base. Closure can also have negative effects on the local economy, as businesses that close may leave behind vacant buildings and lost jobs.  Despite the challenges posed by closure, many businesses find it necessary in order to succeed. Closure can be a necessary step in the evolution of a business, leading to increased profitability and greater stability.

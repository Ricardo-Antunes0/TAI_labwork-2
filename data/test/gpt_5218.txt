The PARC Universal Packet (commonly abbreviated to PARC-U) is a computer network protocol designed to allow arbitrary-length packets to be routed through a computer network. It is sometimes considered to be the predecessor of the modern Ethernet protocol.  The PARC Universal Packet was first proposed in 1974 and completed in 1978. It was initially designed as a replacement for the ARPANET's packet switching protocol, which was becoming increasingly inefficient as the size of packets increased. The PARC Universal Packet is based on the concept of datagrams, which are smaller units of information that can be sent over a network without having to worry about the protocols that govern individual packets. This makes it more efficient than other packet-based protocols, such as the ARPANET's IP protocol, which must handle every possible type of packet.  The PARC Universal Packet has been implemented in several different computer networks, including the Internet, the Worldwide Web, and the Extensible Netware Platform. It is also used in some wireless networks, such as Wi-Fi.

Ralph Thomas Scurfield B.Sc (January 7, 1928 - September 22, 1987) was a British mathematician, specializing in graph theory.  Ralph Thomas Scurfield was born in 1928 in London, England. He obtained his B.Sc. from the University of Cambridge in 1951, and his M.A. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1953. He was a research fellow at Jesus College, Cambridge from 1954 to 1955, and then a lecturer at the University of Cambridge from 1955 to 1964. In 1964 he became a professor at the University of Warwick, where he remained until his death in 1987.  His research focused on graph theory, with particular emphasis on the theory of Eulerian graphs and problems in graph coloring. He also made significant contributions to the theory of Conway's game of life, and proved several important results concerning connectedness and spanning Trees.

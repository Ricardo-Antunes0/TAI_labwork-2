The 2000s commodities boom or the commodities supercycle was a time of unprecedented price growth for a range of commodities, including oil, natural gas, metals, and agricultural products. The boom was caused by factors including increased demand from developing countries, economic recession in developed countries, and technological advances in mining and agriculture. The boom ended in late 2008 or early 2009 due to the global financial crisis.

Some Girls is the 14th British and 16th American studio album by the English rock band the Rolling Stones, released on 9 June 1978 on Rolling Stones Records. By 1976, the Rolling Stones' popularity was in decline as the music industry was dominated by disco and newer rock bands. In addition, the punk rock movement was an emerging cultural force in the UK. Due to legal troubles surrounding guitarist Keith Richards, Mick Jagger is generally regarded as the principal creative force behind Some Girls, with him taking influence by dance music, most notably disco, during the sessions. With recording taking place at Path√© Marconi Studios in Paris, the sessions were highly productive, resulting in numerous outtakes that would appear on subsequent albums. It was the first album to feature guitarist Ronnie Wood as a full-time member; Wood had contributed to some tracks on the band's prior two albums, It's Only Rock 'n Roll (1974) and Black and Blue (1976). With a stable lineup in place for the first time in several years, the album marked a return to basics for the Rolling Stones and did not feature many guest musicians, unlike many of their prior albums. Notable contributions to the album, however, come from blues harmonica player Sugar Blue on "Miss You" and the title track.

Genocide Superstars (often referred to as or shortened to Genocide SS) was a Swedish hardcore punk, rock n' roll band. The band was formed in 1994 in Ã–rebro, Sweden. The lyrics, themes and surrounding artwork tended to revolve around subjects such as violence, totalitarianism, alcohol use, women and motorcycles. Despite the name, the band had nothing to do with national socialism, and never approved of such opinions.  As the members were veteran parts of the 90's crust/hardcore movement in Sweden, chance is the opposite is true; rather than having right-wing sympathies, they were strongly against it.  Guitarist/vocalist Mieszko Talarczyk was one of the victims of the 2004 tsunami, and the band announced on their Myspace page that they had disbanded, as had Talarczyk's other band, Nasum. There is to date no plans whatsoever for the rest of the band to play and record together again, at least not under the name Genocide SS.

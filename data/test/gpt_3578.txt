Maeda Genzō (前田 玄造) (1831–1906) was a Japanese painter and printmaker.  Maeda Genzō was born in Takasaki, Gunma Prefecture, in 1831. He studied art at the School of Painting and Sculpture in Tokyo from 1851 to 1855, and then traveled to Europe to continue his education. He returned to Japan in 1859, and became a member of the Meiji Period's influential "painter-sculptor" group known as the "Kunstkamera".  Maeda Genzō's early paintings were influenced by the work of Jean-Louis-François Millet and other French painters. However, he soon began to experiment with new methods and styles of his own, developing a unique and highly individualistic style that is often characterized as "naturalistic".  Maeda Genzō was very prolific as a painter, and produced more than 2,000 pieces over the course of his career. Many of his paintings are scenes from traditional Japanese folklore or historical events, but he also produced a wide range of other works including landscapes, floral paintings, and depictions of Buddhist monks.  Maeda Genzō died in Tokyo in 1906. He was buried at Zoshigaya Cemetery.

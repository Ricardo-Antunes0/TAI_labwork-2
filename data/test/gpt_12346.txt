The Empire Hotel (also known as the Dunedin Palace) is a historic hotel in Dunedin, New Zealand. It is located on the corner of High and George Streets, opposite the Central Railway Station. The hotel has been at its present site since 1876 and was once one of the grandest and most popular hotels in Dunedin.  The Empire Hotel was designed by Thomas Fuller and built by George Farrant. Construction commenced in 1875, and the hotel opened on 15 December 1876. The Empire was Dunedin's first luxury hotel, and it quickly became one of the city's most popular destinations. Over the years, it has been home to many notable guests, including Sir Edmund Hillary, who stayed in the hotel during his 1949 journey to the South Pole. The Empire's heyday came in the early 20th century, when it was frequented by many of Dunedin's wealthy elite. However, after a series of financial setbacks in the 1970s, the Empire closed down in 1978. It was later reopened as the Imperial Hotel but closed for good in 1998. Since then, it has been used for a variety of purposes, including as a restaurant and nightclub.  The Empire Hotel is now listed as a Category I heritage structure by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, and it is currently undergoing restoration work. The hotel is expected to reopen in 2020 as a luxury hotel once again.

The Woodinville Subdivision is a railroad line that runs through Bellevue, Kirkland, and Woodinville in Washington state. It is owned by BNSF Railway and its main purpose is to provide freight service between Seattle and points east. The line also has a small number of passenger services.  The Woodinville Subdivision was originally built in the early 1900s as part of the Northern Pacific Railroad. It was later acquired by the Burlington Northern Railroad, and then the BNSF Railway. The line has been in continuous operation since its construction.

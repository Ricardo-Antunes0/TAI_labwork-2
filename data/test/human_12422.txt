The Dix Family Stable is an unusual residential outbuilding (now probably converted to a residence) on Stable Lane in Bass Harbor, Maine.   This architecturally distinctive former carriage barn was probably built in the 1890s, and is demonstrably based on a pattern published in Shoppell's Modern Houses, an architectural pattern book.  Outbuildings constructed from such patterns are extremely rare, and this one is in excellent condition.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The construction history of this particular building is not very well known.  The property was acquired in 1881 by Almira T. Dix from her father in 1881, with an additional acre added in 1892.  The building is assumed to have been built around this time, along with the Dixes' elaborate residence, which has not survived.  Its builder is unknown, but it is clearly based on pattern 589 in Shoppell's Modern Houses, published in 1889.  Although the practice of building from mail-order pattern books like this one was widespread, surviving instances of outbuildings with a documented connection to them are extremely rare.  The building was moved about  onto a new concrete foundation in the late 1980s.

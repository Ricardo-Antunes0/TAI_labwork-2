Mogens Lauritssøn, also known as Magnus Lauretii (died 3 October 1542, Antvorskov Monastery, Zealand, Denmark), was the 27th and last Roman Catholic Bishop of Hamar. Background  Nothing is known about the origins of Mogens Lauritssøn.  But he is known to have graduated from the University of Rostock in Germany on 17 April 1494 with a degree of magister, that is, doctor.  He later became a canon in Oslo and, by 1497, the archpriest of the Cathedral Chapter of Oslo. On 28 January 1513, he was already mentioned as the Electus so the election of the new Bishop of Hamar must have happened either in late 1512 or early 1513.  He was still the Electus on 15 July 1513, when he attended a meeting in Copenhagen, but, 12 days later, on 22 July, he was the Bishop. Apparently his consecration must have been performed in Copenhagen between 15 and 22 July 1513.

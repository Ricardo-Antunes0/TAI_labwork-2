Robert Emmet Chambers Jr. (born September 25, 1966) is an American criminal and convicted killer. Chambers was dubbed the Preppy Killer and the Central Park Strangler by the media after the August 26, 1986 strangulation death of 18-year-old Jennifer Levin in New York City's Central Park, for which he was originally charged with second degree murder. Chambers changed his story during the course of the ensuing investigation, ultimately claiming that Levin's death was the accidental result of him pushing her off of him when she caused him pain as she sexually assaulted him, an account that was characterized by media accounts as one of "rough sex". Chambers later pleaded guilty to manslaughter  after a jury failed to reach a verdict after nine days of deliberation. Early life  Robert Chambers was born September 25, 1966. Though not affluent, his mother worked to pay for his childhood attendance at prestigious prep schools in New York City's wealthy Upper East Side, though scholarships assisted in this luxury. The fact that his family had far less money than his classmates resulted in negative social effects, including challenges to his ability to socialize with his peers. By the time he was of college age, he had descended into a life of petty theft, alcoholism, and drug use.

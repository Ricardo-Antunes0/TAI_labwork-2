Closing is a sales term which refers to the process of finalizing a sale and completing the purchase. It is typically the last step in the sales cycle. In order to close a sale, the salesperson must overcome any objections the buyer may have and ensure that all the terms of the sale are met. Closing may also refer to the stage of production where a product or service is finished and ready for delivery to the customer.

Reginald of Canterbury (died after 1109) was an Anglo-Norman archbishop of Canterbury from 1093 to his death. He was the son of Robert Curthose, who had been the Duke of Normandy since 1035.  Reginald was elected archbishop of Canterbury by a faction opposed to Hugh of Lincoln, who had been installed by William II of England after the death of Archbishop Anselm. As archbishop, Reginald worked to reform the church and strengthen royal authority. He also played a role in the Norman conquest of England in 1066, helping to secure the province for William. After William's death in 1100, Reginald opposed Henry I of England and was imprisoned in Bristol Castle. He died before he could be brought to trial.

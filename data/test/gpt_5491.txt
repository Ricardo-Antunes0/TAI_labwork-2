Guryong or Guryong Village  is an isolated and impoverished hamlet located in the east of North Korea. It is one of the most inaccessible and least developed villages in the country, with a population of just over 100 people.  Guryong is home to a small number of traditional farmers who continue to use traditional farming methods despite the harsh economic conditions in North Korea. The villagers are also known for their unique pottery, which is often exported to China.  Guryong Village was first settled in the early 1920s by a group of Korean refugees who had fled to Manchuria after the collapse of the Korean Empire. Since then, it has remained a very isolated and impoverished community, with few resources or opportunities available to its residents.

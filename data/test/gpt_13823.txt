The Bannock War of 1878 was an armed conflict between the United States and the Native American Bannock tribe over land rights. The conflict began when the Bannock attempted to graze their cattle on government land near the town of Burns, Oregon. The United States government responded by sending in troops to drive the Bannocks off the land. The war lasted for eight months and ended with a negotiated settlement.

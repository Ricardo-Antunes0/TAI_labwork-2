The Detroit River flows west and south for about 248 miles (399 km) through Michigan and the U.S. state of Ontario, before emptying into Lake Erie. The Detroit River serves as the international boundary between Michigan and Ontario.  The Detroit River is one of the five Great Lakes. It is the second-longest river in the United States, after the Missouri River. It is also the largest river system in the Midwestern United States. The Detroit River basin has an area of 1,814 square miles (4,628 km2).  The Detroit River forms part of the international boundary between Michigan and Ontario. The river forms part of the boundary between Wayne and Oakland counties in Michigan, between Kent and Essex counties in Ontario, and between Erie and Huron counties in Ohio.  The Detroit River was first explored by Europeans in 1668 when Antoine Cadillac explored its mouth. The first permanent settlement along the river was founded in 1701 by Antoine Laumet de La Mothe Cadillac at Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit (present-day Cadillac). In 1701, Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit was founded as a French fur trading post on what is now downtown Detroit. In 1763, during the American Revolutionary War, British troops captured Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit from the French. The British renamed it Fort Pitt. In 1805, following the War of 1812, the United States acquired control of Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit from Britain

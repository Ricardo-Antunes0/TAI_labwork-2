Desde El Principio is the twelfth studio album by Spanish duo Azúcar Moreno, released on Sony International in 2004. The album saw the Salazar sisters joining forces with a new production team; drummer and percussionist Sergio Castillo and keyboardist Francisco Amat. Castillo and Amat began their career in music in the early 1980s and had previously produced albums with among others Cuban singer Silvio Rodríguez, Tunisian-French Dany Brillant, and in the late 90s and early 2000s most notably the young Spanish rumba-rock duo Estopa to great success. Productionwise Desde El Principio marked a return to Azúcar Moreno's winning formula of the early 90s in that it mixed mainstream Latin pop with material from a wide variety of genres. Tracks like "Sangre Española", "Me Quedo Contigo" and "Vamos a Dejarlo Así" mainly featured drums, percussion and Spanish guitars, recorded live, while lead single "Mi Ritmo" was a typical Azúcar Moreno dance track with a more synthesized and contemporary urban sound. Just like 1991's Mambo the album also featured flamenco/dance covers of a number of pop classics like "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood", a hit for both Nina Simone and The Animals in the 60s and also turned into disco classic by Santa Esmeralda in 1977, the Neapolitan traditional "¡Oh Sole Mío!", also covered by Elvis Presley in English as "It's Now Or Never", but, Azúcar Moreno's large LGBT following in both Europe and South America considered, most importantly their take on Gloria Gaynor's 1979 gay anthem "I Will Survive", retitled "Sobreviviré".

Begg (from Gaelic Beag: little, young, small) is a diminutive form of the word beggar.  The word beggar derives from the Old English word bēag, meaning "a little, young, or small person", and is cognate with the Scots word beggar. In Old English, beggars were called bēagas (plural), from the Proto-Germanic *bega-z. The first recorded use of the word in English is from the 13th century.  The diminutive form Begg is most commonly used in Scotland and Northern Ireland, while the full form Beggar is more common in England. The Scottish Gaelic form Beag means both "little" and "young". The Northern Irish form Beag means "small" or "young".

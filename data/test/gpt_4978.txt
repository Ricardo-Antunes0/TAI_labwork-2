In biology, a transporter is a transmembrane protein that facilitates the diffusion of molecules across the cell membrane. Ion transporters are categorized by their chemical and/or physical transport mechanism.  Ion transporters are a major class of proteins that play an important role in controlling the distribution and concentration of ions within cells. Ions are important because they are responsible for carrying biochemical signals across cell membranes, and they are also essential for many cellular activities. Ion transporters can be classified according to their transport mechanism: active transport, facilitated diffusion, and unidirectional diffusion. Active transport is the most common type of ion transporter, and it occurs when a protein acts as a carrier molecule to ferry ions across the cell membrane. Facilitated diffusion occurs when a protein allows the diffusion of ions through its surface area, while unidirectional diffusion occurs when ions move only in one direction through a protein's surface area.

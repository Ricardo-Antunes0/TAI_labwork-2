The 'Smock, Parachutist DPM', known simply as the 'Smock', is a type of body armor designed to protect the wearer from shrapnel and small arms fire. It consists of a padded garment that is fitted over the entire body, with openings for the head, arms, and legs.   The Smock was first developed in the early 1950s, as a means of protecting paratroopers from enemy fire. It quickly became popular among paratroopers, and has since been used by many other branches of the military. Today, the Smock is still used by paratroopers, but has also been adapted for use by special forces, such as the British Special Air Service and the United States Navy's SEALs.

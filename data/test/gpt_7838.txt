The Antikythera Ephebe, registered as: Bronze statue of a youth with a Corinthian helmet and short chiton, 2nd century BC     This bronze statue of a youth with Corinthian helmet and short chiton is one of the most mysterious ancient pieces of art. Its fascinating inscription and enigmatic features have intrigued scholars for centuries.  The Antikythera Ephebe was discovered in 1901 by sponge divers working on the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera. The wreck had been lying on the seafloor since antiquity, and its contents – including this statue, coins, and other artifacts – were well preserved.  The statue is approximately 20 cm high, and is thought to have been created in the 2nd century BC. It is one of the few known sculptures that depicts a youth – a rarity in antiquity – and its enigmatic inscription has confounded scholars for centuries. Some believe it may be a depiction of an Olympian deity, while others believe it may be a magical talisman or even an astrological chart.

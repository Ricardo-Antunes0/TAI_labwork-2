The Woodinville Subdivision is a railroad line that was formerly owned by BNSF Railway. It takes its name from one of its original end points in Woodinville, Washington, United States. The line extends approximately  in east King County and Snohomish County. The line's ownership has been transferred in a deal involving King County and the Port of Seattle. The section from Snohomish to Woodinville was operated, on contract, by a company called Eastside Rail Freight, which is associated with the Ballard Terminal Railroad and Meeker Southern. However, train traffic on the subdivision is exceedingly rare, with the Seattle region's rail operations now conducted on other higher capacity routes. Route  The line was completed more than a century ago, between 1887-1904 by the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway and by Northern Pacific Railroad. The northern section between present day Woodinville and Snohomish was completed in 1888  and the section between Renton and Woodinville known as "The Belt Line" was completed in 1904. By 1902 Northern Pacific Railroad held all interest in the line it (later became part of the Burlington Northern Railroad and then the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe). The route begins in the area of Renton and Tukwila, at a place called Black River Junction. The rails run north along the eastern shore of Lake Washington through Bellevue and several smaller cities before reaching its northern terminus in the small rural city of Snohomish.

Ahmed Hussein Harkan  (born 10 December 1982) is an Egyptian free speech activist. He is a blogger, vlogger and founder of the Free Mind e-channel, and frequently appeared on several Egyptian talk shows to discuss the rights of nonbelievers during his 10 years as an atheist and activist from 2010 until 2020.  On March 30, 2020, four months after completing a 57-day hunger strike protesting for his right to leave Egypt and marry his fianc√©e in Tunisia, Harkan said he had returned to Islam. After he managed to leave Egypt to Tunisia in January 2021, Harkan returned to his activities again as an atheist activist. And after a few months he spent in Tunisia he moved to Italy and continued his activities. His first name is alternately romanised as Ahmed and Ahmad, his surname as Harkan and Harqan. Sometimes he used only his first and second name to identify himself as Ahmed Hussein.

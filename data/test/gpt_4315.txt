Jan Olof Scherman (born 21 June 1950) is a Swedish author, journalist and former senior editor at the Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet. He has also been a columnist for the Swedish tabloid Expressen.   Scherman was born in 1950 to a Jewish family in Stockholm, Sweden. He converted to Christianity in the 1990s and has since made statements criticizing Islam, Judaism and other religions. In 2004, he was convicted of hate speech after he called Islam "a cancer on the world" in an interview with the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter. Scherman served a two-month jail sentence, but the conviction was later overturned on appeal.

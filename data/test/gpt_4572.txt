The Manila Metrostars were a professional basketball team based in the Philippines. The Metrostars were one of the country's most successful basketball teams, winning three championships in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) and making it to the finals of the All-Filipino Cup.  The Metrostars were formed in 1988 as a merger between the Crispa Redmanizers and the Manila Beermen. The team played their home games at the Araneta Coliseum, but folded in 1995 due to financial problems. They were revived in 2006 and played their final season in 2007.

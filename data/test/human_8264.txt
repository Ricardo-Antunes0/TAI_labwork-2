Imro Fox (May 21, 1862 â€“ March 4, 1910) was German-born American chef who became a headlining stage magician billed as the "comic conjuror". He was active between 1880 and 1910 and was known for the line, "Mahvelous! Everything I do is mahvelous." Early life and career Isidore Fuchs was born in Bromberg, Germany, (today Bydgoszcz, Poland) and immigrated to America seventeen years later aboard the steamship Suabia. Fuchs eventually settled in New York City where he became a citizen in 1888. He began working as a chef at hotels in New York City and later at a hotel in Washington D.C. popular with vaudeville players engaged at the nation's capital. It was at the latter that one day in 1880 he was approached by the head of a vaudeville company in need of a magician. Theirs was unfit to take to the stage and the hotel management had recommended Fuchs, then an amateur magician with no stage experience. The engagement proved satisfactory and within a short while Fuchs began performing as Imro Fox.

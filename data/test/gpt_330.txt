Estero Bay, Florida, is an estuary located in Collier County, Florida. The bay is a part of the Gulf of Mexico and is the largest saltwater estuary in the United States.  The bay was named after the Spanish explorer Estero de Zúñiga y Ayala, who in 1513 sailed into what is now the bay. He named it "Bahía de los Martires" (Bay of the Martyrs), in honor of the hundreds of Spaniards who had died in Florida since the landing of Hernando de Soto in 1539.  The bay was used by Native Americans as a trading post. The first European to visit it was Hernando de Soto in 1539. In 1562, Juan Ponce de León charted it and named it "Las Californias". In 1589, Tristán de Luna y Arellano landed there on his way from Cuba to Spain.   In 1851, during the American Civil War, Union troops captured Pensacola and entered Estero Bay. They named it "Union Bay". After the war, Pensacola became an important naval base and Estero Bay was renamed "Pensacola Bay".  In 1907, Congress created Estero Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve to protect its natural resources.

Oregon Route 36 is an Oregon state highway running from the Nevada state line at Grave Spring to the California state line east of Gold Hill.   Oregon Route 36 was established in 1933, connecting Grave Spring with Gold Hill. The highway was extended west to the California state line in 1945. The route has been reconstructed or replaced several times over the years, most recently in the 1990s.

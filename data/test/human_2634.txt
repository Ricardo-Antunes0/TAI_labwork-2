Alfred Pizzi Newton,  (1830 â€“ 1883) was an English painter in water-colours. Alfred Pizzi Newton, born in 1830, was a native of Essex, but, through his mother, of Italian descent. His earliest works were painted in the Highlands of Scotland, and, as he happened to be painting the scenery near Inverlochy Castle, which was then occupied by Queen Victoria, he obtained her patronage. She selected him to paint a picture as a wedding gift to the Princess Royal in 1858, and he also contributed some sketches for the royal album of drawings. He exhibited a few pictures at the Royal Academy in 1855 and the following years, but on 1 March 1858 he was elected an associate of the "Old" Society of Painters in Water-colours. From this time he was a constant and prolific contributor to their exhibitions, though he did not attain full membership till 24 March 1879. A winter scene, Mountain Gloom, painted in the Pass of Glencoe under trying circumstances, attracted notice in 1860. In 1862 Newton visited the Riviera and Italy, finding there many subjects for his later pictures. In 1880 his picture of The Mountain Pass was much commended. In 1882, though in failing health, Newton visited Athens, painting there, among other pictures, one called Shattered Desolation.

Carl Pearcy is an American mathematician whose research focuses on the geometry of curves and surfaces in three dimensions. He is a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.  Pearcy was born in Brooklyn, New York, on November 19, 1961. He received his undergraduate degree from Cornell University in 1983, and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1986 and 1989, respectively. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Utah from 1989 to 1991, and then became an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison in 1991. In 1994 he moved to the University of California, Los Angeles, where he became a full professor in 2001 and chaired the mathematics department until his retirement in 2018.  Pearcy's research focuses on the geometry of curves and surfaces in three dimensions. His work has included studies of singularities and calculus of variations for problems arising in these areas, as well as contributions to the theory of Lie groups and their applications to geometry. He is also known for his work on geometric combinatorics, including investigations into ways to optimize problems involving shapes and patterns.  Pearcy has been a fellow of the American Mathematical Society since 2003, and he served as president of that society from 2006 to 2007. He has also been a member of the National Academy of Sciences since 2006, and he was awarded the National Medal of Science in 2016 for his contributions to mathematics and physical sciences research.

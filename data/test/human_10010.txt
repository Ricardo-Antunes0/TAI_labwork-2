Antónia Rodrigues (Aveiro, Portugal, 1572-1641), was a Portuguese soldier and national heroine. Antonia was born in the former parish of Sao Miguel de Aveiro and baptized on 5 January 1572 in a poor home of anglers, right outside of the city walls of Aveiro. She was the daughter of Simao Rodrigues and Lianor Dias. At the age of 12, her parents obligated her to move to Lisbon to live with her older sister and brother-in-law, both of whom she did not get along with. She disliked her housework and fought with them and often ran away from their home. Eager to escape, she dressed herself as a man, cut her hair, and disguised herself and adopted the name of António Rodrigues and joined the crew as a cabin boy of the ship named Nossa Senhora do Socorro, loaded with wheat that was heading to the Portuguese territory of Mazagan, in Morocco.

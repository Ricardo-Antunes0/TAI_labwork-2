Offending the Audience is a play by Kenneth Lonergan.  The play is set in a Baptist church in the early 1960s and revolves around the congregation's reaction to the appearance of a new pastor, who symbolizes a change in the community. The characters discuss how to deal with the new pastor, who is seen as a threat by some members of the church. Some members of the church try to woo him away with gifts, while others attempt to make him feel unwelcome. The play explores how people deal with change and how they react when they feel threatened.

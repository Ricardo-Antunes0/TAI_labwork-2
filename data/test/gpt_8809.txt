Speech acquisition focuses on the development of skills that allow people to produce speech. It covers a wide range of topics, including phonetics, articulation, and vocabulary acquisition.  Speech acquisition is a complex process that begins with the individual's innate ability to produce speech sounds. As children learn to speak, they develop skills that allow them to produce more accurate speech sounds. These skills can be acquired through practice and learning.  In order to acquire speech skills, the individual must have a functional voice box. This is an organ in the throat that produces sound when air is forced through it. The voice box is located behind the nose and between the lips. The voice box is lined with soft tissue and has several muscles that help create sound.  The voice box is also important for speech production because it helps to produce different sounds. The voice box can produce consonants by making air move in and out of the throat in different ways. Some consonants are produced by making air move in one direction only ( voiceless consonants ), while others are produced by making air move in both directions ( voiced consonants ).  Voices also differ in terms of their tones. Tones are created by changing the volume, speed, and pitch of a speech sound. There are four main tones in English: high, middle, low, and grave (or deep). The tone of a spoken word can be affected by how loud the speaker is speaking, how fast they are speaking, and where they are speaking in relation to other

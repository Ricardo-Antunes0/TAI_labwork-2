The Permanent Peoples' Tribunal is an international People's Tribunal founded in Bologna, Italy on June 24, 1979 at the initiative of Senator Lelio Basso. History and functions  The Permanent Peoples' Tribunal (TPP) was formally born in Bologna in 1979 as a direct continuation of the experience of the Russell Tribunal II with Latin American dictatorships (1974–1976), promoted by Lelio Basso  to denounce the crimes committed by the military regimes of the region. The will of the people and the victims of Latin America, the changed the occasional nature of Russell Court and it became a permanent forum of complaint for communities experiencing the absence and impotence of international law. Therefore, the TPP is a grass-root initiative and the result of the need to create an independent tool for researching and analysing for the cognitive, cultural and doctrinal development needed to start the process of liberation and justice of the people. The TPP's work is characterised by its subsidiary nature. Just as the Russell Tribunal, the existence of the Permanent People's Tribunal is due, even today, to the absence of a competent international court to rule on the allegations and claims of individuals conceived in their collective dimension. The International Criminal Court, founded in 1998, should have addressed – and with much larger resources – some of the functions carried out by the PPT, but it has often proven too slow and too much influenced by political decisions to perform its functions. Opinion tribunals, including the PPT, is therefore also a mean to push judicial courts based on intergovernmental treaties, such as the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice,  to dare more and to reinforce their impartiality.

The Miller–Urey experiment (or Miller experiment) was a chemical experiment that demonstrated the possibility of the synthesis of organic molecules from inorganic precursors. The experiment was conducted by Stanley Miller and Harold Urey in the early 1940s, and is generally regarded as the first successful example of artificial genesis.  The Miller–Urey experiment demonstrated that it was possible to create organic molecules from inorganic precursors, such as methane and hydrogen gas. This discovery paved the way for the development of modern biochemistry, and has been cited as one of the most important achievements in the history of chemistry.

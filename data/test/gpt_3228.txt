Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) was defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as "the physical and chemical aspects of the water, land, and air that support fish and their populations." EFH provides an essential interface between fish and their environment, and is essential to the health of both.  Fish are an important part of the aquatic food web and play a vital role in maintaining healthy ecosystems. They consume a variety of prey, including harmful bacteria and parasites, which help to keep aquatic ecosystems clean. EFH can also provide critical cover for fish eggs and juvenile fish as they develop.  The quality of EFH can have a direct impact on the health and well-being of fish populations. Poorly maintained EFH can lead to decreased prey availability, higher levels of pollution, and increased water temperature extremes. Properly managed EFH can support a healthy ecosystem that benefits both fish and other aquatic organisms.

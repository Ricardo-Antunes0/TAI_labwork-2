In cryptography, a  custom hardware attack is a form of attack that relies on specially designed hardware to defeat cryptographic protections. Custom hardware attacks are often more effective than software-based attacks, as they can bypass protections that rely on mathematical algorithms, rather than static data.  Cryptography is the practice and theory of secure communication in the presence of third parties. Cryptography is used in a variety of applications, including email and Web browsing, for security purposes. Cryptographic algorithms are designed to make it difficult for attackers to decipher the contents of a message or packet.  Cryptography is based on mathematics and relies on certain principles, such as secrecy and authentication, to ensure the security of communications. Cryptography can be used to protect information from unauthorized access, and to ensure that messages are not tampered with en route.

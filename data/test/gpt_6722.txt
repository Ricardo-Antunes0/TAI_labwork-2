In chemistry an activated complex is defined as a molecule or ion that has been "activated" by an organic or inorganic reagent. The organic reagent can be a simple alkylating agent, such as methyl iodide, or a more complex molecule such as diazomethane. The inorganic reagent can be elemental sulfur, perchlorate, bromine, or iodine.  Activated complexes are used in many different types of chemical reactions. They are especially useful in organic chemistry, where they allow the reaction of two molecules that would not normally react together. Activated complexes also have other advantages, such as being less costly than other types of reagents and having a longer shelf life than unactivated complexes.

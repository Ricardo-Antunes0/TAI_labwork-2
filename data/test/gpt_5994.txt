In integrated circuit design, hardware emulation is the process of designing a circuit using a simulator rather than designing the circuit in a physical chip-level design. This is done for a variety of reasons, including the desire to create a circuit that can be verified using a formal verification method, to speed up the design process, or to reduce the amount of physical testing required.   Hardware emulation can be divided into three categories: software emulation, hardware emulation within a virtual machine, and hardware emulation on a physical chip. Software emulation is the most common form of hardware emulation, where an emulator runs the original code and produces output that matches the behavior of the original hardware. Hardware emulation within a virtual machine is where the emulator runs on an existing virtual machine and produces output that matches the behavior of the original hardware. Hardware emulation on a physical chip is where the emulator runs on a physical chip and produces output that matches the behavior of the original hardware.

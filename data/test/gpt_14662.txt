Project 1231 was a hybrid surface combatant and land-based ballistic missile submarine design project undertaken by the Soviet Navy in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The project was never completed, and its status is unknown. The project's goal was to create a submarine that could simultaneously operate as a surface combatant and launch ballistic missiles from a submerged position.   The project was controversial from the outset, as it was seen as a potentially destabilizing development by NATO. Despite this, Project 1231 progressed to a point where it was considered sufficiently advanced for detailed design work to commence. However, the project was eventually cancelled due to financial constraints and other unspecified reasons.

The Cascade Range or Cascades is a major mountain range in western North America, running from northern California to the southern portion of British Columbia. It is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, and is bordered by the Coast Ranges and the Klamath Mountains to the east, the Sierra Nevada to the south, and the Rocky Mountains to the west.  The Cascades are a series of mountains that form a major barrier between the Pacific Ocean and inland western North America. They are almost entirely made up of younger rocksâ€”the most recent episode in a long process of mountain building that began about 150 million years ago. The Cascades extend for more than 500 miles and are up to 10,000 feet high.   The range has a rich history, with humans first migrating into the region at least 12,000 years ago. The Cascades have been badly damaged by logging, mining and other activities, but they are also home to many rare and endangered species of plants and animals.

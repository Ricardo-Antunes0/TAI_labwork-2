The Satellite Control Network (SCN), operated by the United States Air Force, is a global network of military and civilian satellites used for communication, navigation, surveillance, and air traffic control.  The SCN is divided into three main components: the Military Space Operations Command (MSOC), the Space Control Center (SCC), and the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC). The SCN's primary mission is to provide secure and timely access to space for military users. It accomplishes this by providing real-time satellite navigation and positioning services, satellite communications, missile warning and fire control, and space weather monitoring. The SCN also supports military operations by providing data acquisition and distribution capabilities.  The MSOC is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the SCN. The SCC manages and oversees the use of military satellites, provides situational awareness to all members of the SCN, and coordinates activities with other government agencies. The JSpOC is responsible for planning and executing military space operations. It ensures that all elements of the U.S. military have access to space resources necessary for conducting operations worldwide.

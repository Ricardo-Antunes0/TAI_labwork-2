Lyonbrotherz is a German DJ and producer duo formed of cousins Daniel Lyon (born Daniel Rolletschek) and Keven Lyon (born Keven Br√ºffer). Daniel was born in Ahaus, Germany, on 15 July 1990 and Keven was born in Gronau, Germany, on 19 December 1990. Best known for producing EDM and Hip-hop as well as DJing, the cousins are part of the music production team of I-35 Music and founded the two record labels I-35 Music and League of Lyons. Career  Starting out at the age of 16, Daniel and Keven began as the duo wanted to stay out of trouble and work towards solving their problems. They first wrote rap and Hip-hop lyrics, learning about beats and going on to produce their own as well as national and international artists. Developing their own music skills, Daniel visited one of the biggest electronic music festivals in Germany and encouraged Keven to begin a new chapter in their careers focussed on Electronic dance music (EDM). This was the beginning of Lyonbrotherz.

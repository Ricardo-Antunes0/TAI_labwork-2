Samuel Loudon (1727–1813)  was a colonial American printer, publisher and merchant who emigrated from Ireland some time prior to 1753. Loudon founded The New-York Packet and The American Advertiser and became the postmaster at New York State's first post office in Fishkill, New York. During the American Revolution he became the official printer of the State and printed the first Constitution for New York and other official documents, while also taking on some private commissions. Before and during the American Revolution Loudon became active through the use of his newspapers in the cause for American independence, and for freedom of the press. Early life and family  Loudon was of Scotch-Irish ancestry who emigrated to the America colonies before 1753. Historical accounts, however, vary on his actual place of birth, maintaining he was born either in Ireland or in Scotland, while some accounts express uncertainty. In October of 1753 he owned and operated a general store on Water Street near the Old Slip Market in New York City, where he sold an assortment of wares, including powder and shot, pots and kettles, and a variety of ready-made coats and breeches, in the latest fashions. After four years he moved the location of his store to Hunter's Quay and was  now operating as a ship chandler, selling supplies for ships.

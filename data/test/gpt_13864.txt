In computing, Linux-IO (LIO) Target is an open source project that provides a library to enable hardware-accelerated SCSI access in Linux.  Linux-IO (LIO) Target was created to provide a library that enables hardware-accelerated SCSI access in Linux. It abstracts the low-level SCSI access from the kernel, providing a common interface for drivers and libraries. This allows developers to focus on their applications and not on the details of SCSI access.  LIO Target is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). It is developed by the Linux Foundation's Core Storage Working Group, which is composed of companies and organizations including AMD, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Mellanox Technologies, Microsoft, Oracle Corporation, Samsung Electronics and Synaptics Inc.

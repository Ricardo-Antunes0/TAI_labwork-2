Mission College (Mission or MC)  is a public community college in Santa Clara, California.  It is part of the West Valley–Mission Community College District. The land the college is on was bought between 1966 and 1967. Mission College opened for its first year in 1975. In 1979 it had grown to "3,500 students, 8 administrators, and 73 instructors". History The Mission College Interim Campus was housed on the site of the vacant Jefferson Middle School at the corner  of Monroe Street and Lawrence Express in Santa Clara, California in early September, 1975. From this humble beginning, three members originally appointed for full-time duty—Teri Chiang (Mathematics), Don Joslen (Fine Arts), and Son Le (Philosophy)) worked  with Administrator Burt Hermosillo with the support of several part-time faculty volunteers from West Valley College to offer morning and evening classes. By summer, 1976, the Governing Board had appointed Warren Sorenson as founding president. Mission College's first Commencement took place in June, 1977 with the President of Santa Clara University as Commencement Speaker. Notably, among a handful of graduates for Mission College Class '77 was Eddie Sousa who was later elected Mayor of Santa Clara. The birth of Mission College seemed uneventful; its full development was not, however. Reported disputes over noise levels at West Valley College with its Saratoga residents helped changed the membership of the long-serving Governing Board, leading in upper management changes at both West Valley and Mission Colleges soon after the new Mission College campus was completed in 1979. Even though the departure of its founding president was unexpected, among many legacies of his was Mission College's commitment students as individual learners: individualized self-paced learning, decades before the advent of the digital revolution and cyber learning.

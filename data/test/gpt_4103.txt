Thomas Onwhyn (c.1811 â€“ 21 January 1886) was an English composer and organist.  Born in Birmingham, Onwhyn was the son of a musician, and studied at the Royal Academy of Music under J.S. Bach, Michael William Balfe and Charles Villiers Stanford. He became organist of St George's Chapel, Windsor in 1834 and held the post until his death.  Onwhyn's best-known works are the oratorios "Judas Maccabeus" (1856) and "The Temple" (1868), both based on biblical stories. He also wrote chamber music, choral pieces and orchestral works, some of which are still performed.

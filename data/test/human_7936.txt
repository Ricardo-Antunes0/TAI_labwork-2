Richard Henry "Harry" Goodhew AO (born 19 March 1931) is a retired Australian Anglican bishop who served as the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney from 1993 to 2000. Appointed as a compromise between opposing "conservative" and "liberal" factions of the Sydney Diocese, Goodhew attempted to heal rifts within the diocese while maintaining an Evangelical stance in keeping with the general ethos of the diocese. Goodhew was born in Sydney and educated at the University of Wollongong. He was ordained in 1958 and began his ministry with curacies at St Matthew's Bondi and St Bede's Beverly Hills. Later he held incumbencies at St Paul's Carlingford and St Stephen's, Coorparoo. In 1976 he was appointed a canon of St Michael's Cathedral, Wollongong and in 1979 Archdeacon of Wollongong. He was Bishop of Wollongong from 1982 to 1993. In 1993 he was elected Archbishop of Sydney and the Metropolitan of New South Wales, retiring in 2001. He is married to Pamela Goodhew.

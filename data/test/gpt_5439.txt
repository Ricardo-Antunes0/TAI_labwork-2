Alexander S. Raikhel is a distinguished professor of Mathematics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He is a leading expert in the field of combinatorics and its applications.  Alexander S. Raikhel was born in 1951 in Moscow, Russia. He earned his undergraduate degree from Moscow State University in 1973 and his Ph.D. from the same institution in 1978 under the guidance of Professors V. N. Nikitin and S. A. Popov.  After postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley, he joined the faculty of UC Santa Barbara in 1980. He served as chair of the Department of Mathematics from 1998 to 2000, and as associate dean for research from 2002 to 2006. He has been a visiting professor at several universities, most notably at the University of Cambridge (1989), the University of Paris-Sud (1998), and Princeton University (2002). He has been a fellow of the American Mathematical Society since 1984, and a member of its board since 1998.  Raikhel's research focuses on combinatorics, with particular emphasis on problems arising in probability and statistics, decision theory, computer science, and data analysis. His work has led to numerous patents and textbook contributions, as well as seminal papers in various journals such as Annals of Combinatorics, Journal of Applied Probability, SIAM Journal on Mathematical Analysis, and Discrete Mathematics. In addition to his professorship at UC Santa Barbara, he currently serves as editor-in-chief of

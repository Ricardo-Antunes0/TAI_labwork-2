was a Japanese anarchist, social critic, author and feminist.  She was the editor-in-chief of the feminist magazine Seitō. Her progressive ideology challenged the norms of the Meiji and Taishō periods in which she lived. She drew praise from critics by being able to weave her personal and political ideas into her writings. The Japanese government, however, condemned her for challenging the constructs of the time.  She became a martyr of the ideology in which she believed during the Amakasu Incident. Early life and education  Itō was born on the island of Kyushu near Fukuoka, Japan on January 21, 1895. She was born into an aristocratic family and convinced an uncle to pay for her education at Ueno Girls High School in Tokyo, from which she graduated. It was at this school where she developed an affinity for literature. She was particularly fond of the progressive ideas of the time from Western and Japanese writers.

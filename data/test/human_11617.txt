Thomas Eastchurch (? - January, 1678) was governor of Albemarle County, North Carolina between 1675 and 1676. During his time in office, he imprisoned the former governor John Jenkins for various offenses. Jenkins was later released from prison with the aid of his supporters and reclaimed his position as governor in the spring of 1676. After Eastchurch explained the situation in London to the Lords Proprietors, they reappointed him as governor. In 1677, he left London to celebrate his honeymoon in Nevis Island. During his absence, his fellow proprietary Thomas Miller acted as governor. Miller's crimes created a revolt and Eastchurch, upon return to Albemarle, was unable to help the government recover. In addition, the Anti-Proprietors' leaders decided to send an army to the northern part of the Albemarle County to prevent the new governor from accessing Albemarle. Although Eastchurch sought aid to invade the county, he never got it. He did not return to government of Albemarle until after the spring of 1676. Biography

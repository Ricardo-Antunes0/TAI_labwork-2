Bonnymuir was a moorland ("bonny muir" effectively means "beautiful meadow") in the east central highlands of Scotland. It was the site of a Royal Forest and Park, which is now a National Nature Reserve.   Bonnymuir was declared a Royal Forest and Park in 1792 by George III as part of his project to create a network of protected areas across Britain. The forest covered an area of and contained a number of waterfalls, including the impressive Dunachie Falls. The park also contained a number of hills, including the 1142 ft (355 m) high Black Mount.   The Royal Forest and Park was closed to the public in 1922, largely due to the effects of sheep farming on the moorland. However, parts of the park remain open to visitors as part of the Scottish National Heritage Trail.

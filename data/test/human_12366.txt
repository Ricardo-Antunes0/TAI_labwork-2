Eine romantische Suite (A Romantic Suite), Op. 125, is a suite for orchestra by Max Reger, based on poems by Joseph von Eichendorff. Reger described this suite, composed and first performed in 1912, and the Vier Tondichtungen nach A. Böcklin, Op. 128, as "Ausflug in das Gebiet der Programmusik" (Excursion in the realm of program music). History  Reger composed the suite in Meiningen during May and June 1912. He was director of music of the Hofkapelle there from 1911 to 1914, and wrote most of his compositions for orchestra during this time.  He dedicated the work to Hugo Grüters. During composition time, Reger already offered the premiere to Ernst von Schuch, who had successfully conducted the premiere of Der Rosenkavalier in 1911, and who had a passion for contemporary music. Schuch programmed works by Regers regularly from 1906 for the Königliche musikalische Kapelle (Royal Chapel) in Dresden, and had engaged Reger as the pianist for Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 in 1911. Reger dedicated his Lustspiel-Ouvertüre, Op. 120, to the conductor in return.

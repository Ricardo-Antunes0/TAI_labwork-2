Near Balmain, it splits into two pipes, one continuing north-west towards Randwick and the other continuing south-east towards Kings Cross. The two pipes rejoin near Pyrmont, just north of the Sydney CBD.  The Southern Outfall Sewer has been subject to several major incidents over its lifetime. In 1988, an overflow caused by heavy rainfall caused widespread contamination of areas around Watsons Bay. In 2000, a burst pipeline caused extensive flooding in parts of Balmain and Botany Bay. In 2007, another burst pipeline caused extensive flooding in parts of Balmain and Botany Bay again.

Stanton Preparatory Academy was founded in 1925 to prepare young men for entrance to the United States Military Academy at West Point and the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis. The school was located in Cornwall, New York, five miles from West Point. The school was founded and led by Lieutenant Colonel Hubert G. Stanton (born September 14, 1897 â€“ died September 15, 1955). It followed in the tradition established by the National Preparatory Academy. That institution was owned and led by LT Charles Braden from 1890 until his death in 1919. In the late 1920s, some sources refer to it as the "Stanton Loomis Academy." Stanton was a 1911 graduate of West Point. He was the president of the class of 1911. Commissioned as an officer in the coastal artillery, he was an instructor in the Department of Mathematics at the Academy between 1911 and 1914 and returned in 1917 as an assistant professor remaining as a member of the faculty until 1925.

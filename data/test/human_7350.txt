Ribocco (foaled 1964 in Kentucky) was an American-bred British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He is best known for his performances in 1967 when he won two of the most important European races for three-year-olds; the  Irish Derby and the St Leger. Ribocco briefly held the record for prize money won by a British-trained racehorse. Background Ribocco was a small, powerfully built bay horse bred at the Idle Hour Farm in Paris, Kentucky by Mrs J. G. (Margaret) Rogers. As a yearling, he was sent to the Keeneland sales where he was bought for $35,000 by  Charles W. Engelhard, Jr. He was a son of the undefeated dual Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Ribot out of the mare Libra. Libra won one minor race before becoming a notable broodmare, producing Ribero (Irish Derby, St Leger) and Libra's Rib (Princess of Wales's Stakes). Ribocco was sent to England to be trained by Fulke Johnson Houghton at Blewbury in Berkshire.

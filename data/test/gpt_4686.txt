Elijah ben Elkanah Capsali (Hebrew: אליהו בן-עלכן קספליא‎) (c. 1575 – 1640) was an Italian Jewish scholar, rabbi, and Kabbalist.  Capsali was born in Ferrara, Italy, in 1575. He studied under Moses Hayyim Luzzatto and Abraham Zacuto. He then traveled to Safed, where he became the rabbi of the Jewish community there. Capsali is best known for his book Shaarei Teshuvah (The Way of Repentance), which was published posthumously in 1640.

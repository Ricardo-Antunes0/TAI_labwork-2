History TV18 (formerly known as The History Channel) is a pan-Indian television channel broadcasting programmes related to historical events, infotainment and persons, owned by a joint venture between A+E Networks, owner of the American History channel, and TV18, an Indian JV media group. It is available in five languages in full HD across the Indian subcontinent. History History was first launched as The History Channel on 30 November 2003. It was launched by a joint venture between AETN International and News Corporation's STAR, through its subsidiary NGC Networks. It had aired series like Boy's Toys, Biography, Conspiracy?, Crusades, Secret Agents and Breaking Vegas and television movies like Marilyn and Me. Following the expiration of the deal between AETN and STAR on 21 November 2008, STAR took over the channel and re-branded it as Fox History & Entertainment. That channel has since been re-branded again as Fox History & Traveller, then Fox Traveller and is currently available in India as Fox Life.

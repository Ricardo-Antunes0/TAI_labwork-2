The Mayflower Steps are close to the entrance of Plymouth Harbor on the east side of Plymouth, Massachusetts. They are a series of twelve concrete steps that lead down to the harbor and were built in 1912 in order to improve access for ships. The steps have been designated a National Historic Landmark and are a popular tourist destination.

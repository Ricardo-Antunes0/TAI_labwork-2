UV is the +5 oxidation state of uranium which is found in the form of [UO2]1+. This species is known as pentavalent uranyl cation and has a low stability due to the disproportionation into tetravalent and hexavalent uranium species.                          The oxidation states of uranium compounds vary from +2 to +6 (UII - UVI). Out of all these oxidation states +6 is the most common one and it is found in the form of [UO2]2+ (uranyl dication). This hexavalent form of uranium species is known to be the most thermodynamically stable species and it is soluble in water. Even though the uranium chemistry is well explored pentavalent uranyl chemistry is under developed due to the low stability of these compounds. There are two naturally occurring pentavalent uranium-containing minerals reported.  	  Wyartite – Ca[UV(UVIO2)2(CO3)O4(OH)](H2O)7	  Dehydrated Wyartite – Ca(CO3)[UV(UVIO2)2O4(OH)](H2O)3 Synthesis Pentavalent uranyl complexes are obtained by the oxidation of UIV or other low-valent uranium compounds and these reactions are done under oxygen-free conditions in organic solvents. The oxidation of UIII and UIV precursors under non-aqueous conditions or controlled hydrolysis conditions gives large polyoxo uranium clusters containing UV. Hydrothermal synthesis is another method used to obtain UV silicates where the reactions are carried out under high temperatures like 600 °C. Another way to make pentavalent uranyl complexes is the reduction of UVI containing [UO2]2+. In this method hexavalent uranyl complexes are reduced to UV complexes in aqueous solutions using electrochemical or photochemical reductions in the presence of  a stabilizing carbonate or organic ligand. An example for the use of electrochemical reduction method to obtain pentavalent uranyl complexes is shown below:

In China, the practice of medicine is one of the oldest and most respected professions. Medical knowledge and techniques have been passed down from generation to generation, and have evolved to become one of the most advanced in the world.   Medicine in China is based on the theory of the Five Phases, which holds that all physical and emotional ailments can be cured by manipulating the five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. Physicians rely on a wide variety of treatments, including acupuncture and herbalism, to restore health. Today, Chinese medicine is widely accepted as one of the most effective forms of treatment available.

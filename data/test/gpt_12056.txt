Whitewashing in beauty is a phenomenon in which a person, often a white person, applies light-colored cosmetics or hair dye to a person of color in order to make them appear more Caucasian.  The practice of whitewashing has been criticized for its discriminatory effects, as it can create the perception that people of color are not appropriately represented in the beauty industry. Whitewashing has also been accused of perpetuating the stereotype that people of color are only good for performing manual labor or being used as decorative objects.

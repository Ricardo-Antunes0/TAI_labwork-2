Muhammad Hatta Lukman (26 February 1920 â€“ 1965) was an Indonesian communist politician, who served as the First Deputy Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), and a member of the People's Representative Council from 1956 until 1959. He was executed following the 1965 crackdown on the PKI. Lukman's father was a kiai, a Muslim religious scholar who was active in Sarekat Rakyat (People's Association), a Communist breakaway group from the Sarekat Islam. After the failed 1926 communist uprising against the Dutch colonial government, Lukman's father was imprisoned and in 1929 was exiled to the Boven Digul detention camp, West Papua. His family went with him, and  Lukman grew up among political prisoners. In 1938 Lukman returned to his home town of Tegal and worked as a bus conductor until the 1942 Japanese invasion. He joined the then illegal Indonesian Communist Party in 1943, at the same time as future leader D. N. Aidit.

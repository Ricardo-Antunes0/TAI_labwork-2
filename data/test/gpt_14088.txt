The Treasure of Begram or Begram Hoard is a large archaeological treasure found in 1899 by the British archaeologist Alexander Cunningham at the site of ancient Begram, in what is nowTurkey.  The hoard consists of over 600 gold and silver objects, including fine jewellery, coins, and weapons. It is one of the largest and most significant archaeological finds from before the modern era.  The Treasure of Begram has been exhibited in London (as part of the British Museum's collection), Istanbul (where it is on display at the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations), and other locations.

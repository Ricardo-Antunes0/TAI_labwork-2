The dogger  was a form of fishing boat, described as early as the fourteenth century, that commonly operated in the North Sea. Early examples were single-masted: by the seventeenth century, two-masted doggers were common. They were largely used for fishing for cod by rod and line. Dutch boats were common in the North Sea, and the word dogger was given to the rich fishing grounds where they often fished, which became known as the Dogger Bank. The sea area in turn gave its name to the later design of boat that commonly fished that area, and so became associated with this specific design rather than the generic Dutch trawlers. Design The dogger was a development of the ketch. It was gaff-rigged on the main-mast, and carried a lug sail on the mizzen, with two jibs on a long bowsprit. The boats were generally short, wide-beamed and small, and were used for trawling or line fishing on the Dogger Bank. The name "dogger" was effectively synonymous with ketch from the early seventeenth century, until the ketch began to increase in size during the period, eventually rising above 50 tons in the middle of the century.

The freshwater whipray (Urogymnus dalyensis) is a little-known species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae, found in a number of large rivers and associated estuaries in northern Australia. Until recently, this species was regarded as a regional subpopulation of the similar-looking but much larger giant freshwater stingray (U. polylepsis) of Southeast Asia. Typically reaching  across, the freshwater whipray has a distinctively shaped, rounded pectoral fin disc, a projecting snout, and a thin tail without fin folds. It is plain brown above and white below with dark marginal bands. It may occasionally travel onto land and can "breathe" out of water for up to 7 minutes. The freshwater whipray is an active hunter of small fishes and shrimps, and does not currently face substantial conservation threats. Taxonomy The first known specimen of the freshwater whipray was caught during a 1989 scientific expedition from the Daly River, after which it would eventually be named. Various authors have mistakenly referred to this ray as the estuary stingray (Dasyatis fluviorium), or identified it with the similar U. polylepsis. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic studies have since found that this species is in fact distinct from U. polylepsis, and it was formally described by Peter Last and B. Mabel Manjaji-Matsumoto in a 2008 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) paper. The type specimen is a juvenile male  across, collected from the Pentecost River.

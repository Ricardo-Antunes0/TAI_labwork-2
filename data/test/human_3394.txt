Catharine Flood McCall (1766â€“March 9, 1828) was an early 19th century business women, during a time when women generally did not operate businesses or manage finances. Prior to and during the American Revolutionary War, she was educated in Scotland and London. She inherited Cedar Grove and Clydeside plantations following the death of her maternal grandfather, Dr. Nicholas Flood in 1776. Parliament passed a law that prevented people traveling to the British colonies during the war. McCall and her father were unable to return to Virginia until 1782. She was among the largest slaveholders in Essex County, Virginia and received an inheritance from her maternal grandfather of the Cedar Grove and Clydeside plantations.  Beginning in 1798, she owned blacksmith shops and nail factories in Alexandria and Richmond, Virginia, during a period of growth in Virginia when there was a demand for nails to build wooden houses and buildings. Her business competed against Thomas Jefferson's and the Virginia State Penitentiary's blacksmith and nailery businesses. After the penitentary had understood McCall's nailery, she sold the business in 1815 to William Stewart, Jr. who died with outstanding debts. McCall was sued for his debts, claiming that McCall had not properly sold the business to Stewart. McCall lived in Georgetown in the District of Columbia in her later years.

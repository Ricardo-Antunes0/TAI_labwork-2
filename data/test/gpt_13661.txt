Defensio Tridentinæ fidei (full title: Defensio Tridentinæ fidei adversus haereses, tam Protestantanas quam Romananas) is a theological work by the Catholic theologian Thomas Aquinas.   The work was written in answer to a request by the University of Paris to provide a defence of the Catholic faith against Protestantism and Romanism. The work was completed in 1265, and was first published in 1274. The work is divided into three parts: the first part defends the existence of God against objections from philosophy, the second part defends revelation against objections from philosophy and reason, and the third part defends the doctrines of the Catholic Church against objections from philosophy and reason.  Part I of the work defends the existence of God against objections from philosophy. Aquinas begins by distinguishing between two types of being: primary and secondary being. Primary being refers to beings that exist by themselves, without anything else creating them; secondary beings are beings that exist because something else creates them. Aquinas argues that only primary beings can exist independently of anything else; secondary beings can only exist insofar as they are related to primary beings. Therefore, only primary beings can exist necessarily.  Aquinas next argues that only primary beings can be infinite. He says that everything that exists is finite, but that nothing is infinite in itself: something is infinite only insofar as we measure it using finite terms. Therefore, only primary beings can be infinite in essence.  Aquinas next argues that only primary beings can have absolute perfections.

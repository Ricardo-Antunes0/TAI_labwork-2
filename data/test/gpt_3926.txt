Poetry of Scotland includes all forms of verse, from  ballads and folk songs to sonnets and odes. The earliest examples date back to the Middle Ages, when poets such as Blind Harry and Robert Henryson wrote  elegies and epics. During the Renaissance, many Scottish poets such as William Dunbar and James I of Scotland produced works in the classical traditions. In the 18th century, Alexander Pope and John Gay helped to popularize Scottish poetry in England, while Robert Burns helped to make it a national symbol. After his death in 1796, Scots poetry entered a period of decline that was only reversed during the Romantic era. Today, there is a thriving Scottish poetry scene, with many poets working in both traditional and experimental styles.

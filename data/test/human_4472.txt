The AECOM Building, formerly known as the Penton Media Building, and the Bond Court Building, is a commercial high-rise building in Cleveland, Ohio. The building rises 253 feet (77 m) in Downtown Cleveland. It contains 21 floors, and was completed in 1972. The AECOM Building currently stands as the 29th-tallest building in the city, tied in rank with the Ohio Savings Plaza and Ameritech Center. The architectural firm who designed the building was Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, who also designed Chicago's Willis Tower and Dubai's Burj Khalifa. The building is a part of the Bond Court complex. The Bond Court area used to contain nightclubs and bars but was cleared in the 1960s to 1970s for the office block and the Westin Hotel Cleveland. The modernist tower served as the world headquarters of Penton Media from 2000 until the company's merger with Prism Business Media. Penton Media signed a 10-year lease agreement to occupy the building in 2000; in the process, the building was also renamed from the "Bond Court Building" to the "Penton Media Building".

Constantine Walter Benson OBE (2 February 1909 â€“ 25 December 1993) was an Australian mathematician and computer scientist who, with John McCarthy, co-founded the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in 1962. He later served as its first director.  Born in 1909 in Melbourne, Australia, Constantine Walter Benson attended the University of Melbourne and then the University of Cambridge, where he received his doctorate in mathematics in 1934. He then worked at the University of Oxford as a research fellow and lecturer before moving to Stanford University in California in 1962. There, with John McCarthy, he founded the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. From 1967 to 1973 he served as its first director.  Benson's work in mathematical logic and artificial intelligence has had a profound impact on both fields. His seminal paper "A logical method for computing the truth value of a sentence" is widely regarded as one of the foundations of modern symbolic logic. In artificial intelligence, his work on natural language processing has been cited as an important early influence on the field.  Constantine Walter Benson died in 1993 at the age of 87.

Maryland Route 381 (MD 381) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The state highway runs from U.S. Route 40 (US 40) in Havre de Grace east to the Pennsylvania state line near Perryville, where the highway continues as Pennsylvania Route 381 (PA 381). MD 381 is a part of the National Highway System from its western terminus at US 40 to its eastern terminus at the Pennsylvania state line.  MD 381 was created in the early 1930s when US 40 was shifted to a new bypass east of Havre de Grace. The old route through Havre de Grace became MD 386. MD 381 originally followed what is now MD 385 and MD 386 to the Pennsylvania state line, where it followed PA 381 northwest to Perryville. In the late 1950s, MD 381 was rerouted to its current eastern terminus at US 40. The old route through Havre de Grace became MD 386A.  MD 381 is a two-lane undivided highway that runs through rural areas of western Maryland. The state highway traverses the towns of Havre de Grace, Perryville, and Cumberland before reaching the Pennsylvania state line. In Perryville, PA 381 crosses into Pennsylvania and becomes concurrent with PA 132. The two highways continue eastward into Monongahela County, where they reach the town of Greensburg, before reaching their eastern terminus at PA 3 in Irwin Township just outside Pittsburgh.  MD 38

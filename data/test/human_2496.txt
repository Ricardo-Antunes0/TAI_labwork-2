Bogoslof Island or Agasagook Island  is the summit of a submarine stratovolcano at the south edge of the Bering Sea,  northwest of Unalaska Island of the Aleutian Island chain. It has a land area of  and is uninhabited. The peak elevation of the island is . It is  long and  wide. The stratovolcano rises about  from the seabed, but the summit is the only part that projects above sea level. The island is believed to be relatively new, with the volcano being entirely below sea level before 1796, and most of the presently 300 acre island being formed by eruptions since 1900. History The first known emergence of the island above sea level was recorded during an underwater eruption in 1796. Since then, parts of the island have been successively added and eroded. About  northwest of Bogoslof, a small volcanic dome emerged in 1883 from the same stratovolcano and has become a stack rock formation known as Fire Island. On the southwest side of Bogoslof, another dome erupted in 1796; it is now called Castle Rock. Other eruptions have occurred in 1796–1804, 1806–1823, 1883–1895, 1906, 1907, 1909–1910, 1926–1928, 1992, and 2016–2017. The island is a breeding site for seabirds, seals, and sea lions. An estimated 90,000 tufted puffins, guillemots, red-legged kittiwakes and gulls nest here.

Sir John Baptist Medina or John Baptiste Medina (born November 5, 1792 in Valencia, Spain – died October 25, 1856 in Madrid) was a Spanish physician and naturalist who was a founding father of modern parasitology.  He is credited with the discovery of the causative agents of malaria and yellow fever, and he was also the first to describe the pathology of dengue fever. He is also known for his work on leprosy, rabies, and trypanosomiasis.  Medina was a student of José Joaquín Carreño y Valero at the University of Valencia. In 1814 he became a doctor of medicine at the University of Barcelona. He moved to Madrid in 1823 to become a professor at the University of Madrid, and in 1834 he became a member of the Royal Academy of Medicine.  Medina was one of the founders of the Instituto de Medicina Tropical (IMT), which later became known as the Instituto de Parasitología y Malaria (IPM). He was also a founder of the Sociedad Española de Medicina Tropical (SEMT).  Medina is buried in Madrid's Generalife garden.

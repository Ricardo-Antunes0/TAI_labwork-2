Artika Sari Devi Kusmayadi (born 29 September 1962) is an Indian artist who lives and works in Mumbai. She is known for her paintings, drawings, and installation work that uses traditional and nontraditional media.  Sari Devi was born in 1962 in the town of Kusmayadi in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. She was educated at the Government Arts College, Chennai, India, where she received a diploma in painting in 1984. After graduating from college, Devi worked as a painter and sculptor before moving to Mumbai in 1988.  Devi's art is based on her own readings and experiences of the world. Her paintings are often complex and layered, with strong geometric elements and references to mythology and folklore. Her drawings are often humorous and depict everyday life in Mumbai or rural India. Her installations use natural materials such as sand, mud, or leaves to create immersive environments that can be seen from all directions.  Devi has been exhibited nationally and internationally, including exhibitions at the Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery (UK), the National Gallery of Victoria (Australia), the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit (USA), and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a (Spain).

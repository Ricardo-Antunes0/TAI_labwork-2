Node graph architecture is a software design structured around the notion of a node graph. Both the source code as well as the user interface is designed around the editing and composition (or linking) of atomic functional units. The source code for the software application is organized into atomic functional units called nodes. This is typically done using classes derived from a base class for all nodes. Each node can have inputs and outputs, which are typically also implemented using classes derived from base classes for all inputs and all outputs. Outputs and inputs can refer to each other, typically by holding pointers to instances of other outputs or inputs. When a node executes its functionality, it retrieves its inputs by following the pointers stored in its inputs to retrieve data output by other nodes. The node then executes its operation on these inputs to produce its own outputs. The ability to link nodes together in this way allows complex tasks or problems to be broken down into atomic nodal units that are easier to understand.

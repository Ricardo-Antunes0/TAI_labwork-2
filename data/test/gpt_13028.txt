El Dorado (, ; Spanish for "the golden one") is a legendary city or land mentioned in classical literature, most notably in the novel The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain.  The city is said to be located in the New World, and many attempts were made by Europeans over the centuries to find it. There is no definitive answer as to where El Dorado might be, but some theories suggest it may be in South America, Central America, or possibly even in the Amazon basin.

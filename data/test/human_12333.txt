The pipeline was inaugurated on 26 November 2009, and it is operated by Transportadora Urucu-Manaus S.A., a subsidiary of Petrobras. Sections The  long pipeline consists of three sections. As a first section, the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline from the production facility in Urucu to Coari was switched to carrying natural gas, while parallel to this a new  long  LPG (GLPduto) pipeline was constructed.  The second section connects Coari and Anamã and third section connects Anamã-Manaus.  In addition to the main trunkline, the pipeline has seven branches.

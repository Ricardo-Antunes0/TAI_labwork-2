Yasushi Adachi (, 14 October 1965, Osaka, Japan) is a Japanese artist who practices painting, sculpture, and installation art.  Adachi was born in Osaka, Japan in 1965. He studied at the University of Tokyo from 1982 to 1986, and then at the Royal College of Art in London from 1986 to 1988.  Adachi's paintings are characterized by their meticulous attention to detail, as well as their often quirky and humorous elements. His sculptures often incorporate everyday objects into unusual and unexpected configurations, and his installations often invite the viewer to explore their depths or to engage with them directly.  Adachi has had numerous solo exhibitions throughout Europe, Asia, and North America since his debut in 1988, and his work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Tate Gallery in London, and the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne. He is also a member of P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center in New York City.

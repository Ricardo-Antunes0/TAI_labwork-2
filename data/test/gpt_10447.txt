Ocean dynamical thermostat is a physical mechanism that uses the ocean's surface currents to regulate the Earth's climate. It was first proposed by John T. Mason in 1976 and has been extensively studied since then.  The ocean dynamical thermostat is a physical mechanism that uses the ocean's surface currents to regulate the Earth's climate. The theory states that the Earth's climate is controlled by the flow of warm water from the tropics to the poles, and that changes in this flow can affect global temperatures.

Advanced Research for passive Thermal Exchange (ARTE) is a project intended to create "Thermal Exchange", an experiment for the International Space Station (ISS). It is a heat pipe technology demonstrator in which the heat pipes contain low toxicity fluid. Thermal Exchange has been designed by Argotec in collaboration the Italian Space Agency (ASI). Polytechnic University of Turin participated in the project with the development of a prototype of the electronics and software. On April 4, 2016, the experiment was conducted nominally on board the International Space Station by the American astronaut Timothy Kopra. History  In 2012 Argotec started research in the field of passive heat transfer for the internal development of a device called a heat pipe. This technology is known in the scientific field, but at the moment in Europe there are very few producers and Italy is limited to the purchase of foreign products. Argotec developed a numerical model in order to design a device that can maximize the performance thanks to the optimal combination of external geometry (diameter and length of the tube) and internal geometry (grooves).

The Honda CR250R was a Honda racing motorcycle produced from 1985 to 1988.  The Honda CR250R was developed as a replacement for the Honda CR125R, which had been raced in the 250cc class since 1978. The CR250R was designed to be easy to ride and maintain, with features such as a single-cylinder engine and shaft-drive.  The CR250R was a successful motorcycle, winning races in both the United States and Europe. In 1988, Honda released the CR250RS, which had a higher specification engine and frame. The CR250RS remained competitive until the introduction of the sport-utility motorcycle category in the 1990s.

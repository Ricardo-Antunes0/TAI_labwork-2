A jackboot is a military boot such as the cavalry jackboot or the hobnailed jackboot. The hobnailed jackboot has a different design and function from the first type. It is a combat boot that is designed for marching. It rises to mid-calf or higher with no laces and usually has a leather sole with hobnails. Jackboots have  been associated with totalitarianism, as they were worn by German military and paramilitary forces during the Second World War. Cavalry jackboot The term originally denoted tall winged leather cavalry boots, which were reinforced against sword blows by use of mail sewn into the lining of the leather. The wings on these high boots particularly protected a rider's knee-joint from a sword blow. These boots are still worn and still so termed by the Household Cavalry regiment of the British Army, founded in the 17th century.  The term originates from the French word jaque meaning "coat of mail". These boots were made very heavy by the mail reinforcement and are slightly less so today from the use of modern materials as stiffeners. There are few manufacturers of cavalry jackboots extant in the 21st century, the most famous being Schnieder Boots of Mayfair, London, the official supplier to Her Majesty the Queen's Household Cavalry.

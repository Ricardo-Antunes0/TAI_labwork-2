Blurt is a music print magazine and online outlet originally based in Silver Spring, MD. The magazine was originally known as Harp Magazine for over 10 years, also based in Silver Spring, and was considered one of the best music magazines of the decade in the early 2000s. After Harp folded in March 2008 (at the behest of its parent company, which also owned JazzTimes, it declared bankruptcy), Blurt was founded by Harp owner Scott Crawford. Some of the main writers and editors for Harp also started Blurt with Crawford, including managing editor Fred Mills (of Asheville, NC, and also a contributing editor to Stereophile, Magnet and other music industry publications and alternative weeklies), senior editor Randy Harward (also an editor for the Salt Lake City weekly paper), and senior editor Andy Tennille (a journalist and photographer, currently the photographer for Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers). Blurts tag line is "Real Music, Real Artists, Real Opinions". Blurt is a highly respected outlet within the music industry and has often been cited by critics and fans as the Mojo magazine of the United States. It initially launched as an all-digital, downloadable online magazine, publishing five issues in that format before moving to print for the next nine issues while also posting each issue online, frequently with expanded content, at BlurtOnline.com. In early 2010, Crawford sold the Blurt assets to Stephen Judge of Second Motion Entertainment and the company moved to the label's home of Carrboro, NC. Second Motion Entertainment also owns the record label Second Motion Records which works with such artists as Australia's The Church, Bettie Serveert, Swervedriver, Parson Red Heads and Tommy Keene.

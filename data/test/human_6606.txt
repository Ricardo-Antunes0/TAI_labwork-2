In Germany's federal electoral system, coalition governments are a potential outcome in the Bundestag. As German political parties are often associated with particular colors, coalitions are frequently given nicknames based on the colors included. Prominent political parties in Germany are the CDU/CSU (black; ), the SPD (red; ), the Greens (green; ), the Left (also red, usually depicted with magenta; ), the AfD (blue; ), and the FDP (yellow; ). History  It is rare for either the Christian Democratic Union of Germany together with their partners the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CDU/CSU), or the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), to win an unqualified majority in a national election. Thus, at the federal level, governments are formed with at least two parties. For example, Helmut Kohl's CDU governed for years in coalition with the Free Democratic Party (FDP); from 1998 to 2005 Gerhard Schr√∂der's SPD was in power with the Greens; and from 2009 to 2013 Angela Merkel, CDU/CSU was in power with the FDP.

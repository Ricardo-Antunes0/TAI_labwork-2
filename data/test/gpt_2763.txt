Jon Jakobsen Venusinus (c. 1558 â€“ 1608) was a Danish Renaissance painter.  Venusinus was born in the town of Aarhus in Denmark, and was the son of the painter Jakob Nielsen Venusinus. He is considered one of the leading representatives of the Danish School of Painting in the late 16th century. He is most noted for his portraits and religious paintings, but he also produced landscapes, still lifes, and scenes from classical mythology.  Venusinus worked mainly in Copenhagen and Aarhus, but he also travelled to Germany, Italy, and Spain. He died in Aarhus in 1608.

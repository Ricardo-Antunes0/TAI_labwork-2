The Finnish army, commanded by Field Marshal Erkki Kiihtelys, was attempting to break through the Soviet lines in order to reach Sweden and help the Allies in their fight against Nazi Germany. The Soviet Union, commanded by General Georgy Zhukov, was attempting to stop the Finns and protect their lines of communication. The two sides fought a series of battles over a period of four months. In the end, the Finnish army was unable to break through the Soviet lines and was forced to retreat back into Finland.

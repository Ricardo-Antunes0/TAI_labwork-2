A Hebraist is a specialist in Jewish, Aramaic, or Hebrew linguistics.  The study of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Hebrew linguistics is known as Hebraic studies. Hebraic studies covers a wide range of topics, from the history of the Hebrew language and literature to modern Hebrew grammar and semantics. Hebraists also study the origins and development of the Aramaic language, as well as the related languages of Assyrian, Babylonian, and Canaanite.  Hebraic studies is a relatively new discipline, dating back only to the 19th century. However, the field has seen rapid growth in recent decades, due in part to renewed interest in Hebrew and Aramaic languages among scholars outside of Judaism. Today, Hebraic studies is an important part of academic research in many universities around the world.

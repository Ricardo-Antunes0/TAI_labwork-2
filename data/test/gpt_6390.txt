Asymmetric C-elements are extended C-elements which allow for the construction of chiral molecules. They are named after the asymmetry that they introduce in the electronic structure of chiral molecules: the methyl group on the left-hand side of the C-element is more electron rich than the methyl group on the right-hand side.  Asymmetric C-elements were first discovered in 1992 by a team of scientists at DuPont. They were able to create a new class of chiral molecules by using a simple synthetic method. Since then, asymmetric C-elements have become an important tool in the field of organic chemistry. They are particularly useful for creating chiral drugs and pesticides.  Asymmetric C-elements can be created by two different methods. The first method involves using a transition metal complex to catalyze the oxidation of a carbon-carbon double bond. The second method involves using a ligand to bind to a carbon atom and then adding a transition metal ion.

Jane Anyango Odongo was born in 1950 in the town of Kisii, in the Kisii District of Kenya. She completed her secondary education at Mt. Kenya Girls High School, before attending the University of Nairobi to study law.   While still a student, Odongo became involved in activism to promote human rights and democracy. In 1972 she founded the Kenyan Human Rights Association (KHRA), which became one of the country's leading human rights organisations. In 1975 she was arrested and tortured while serving as secretary-general of KHRA, an experience that led her to become an outspoken advocate for human rights.

In 2009 she was awarded the prestigious Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders by Amnesty International.  Today, Odongo continues to fight for human rights throughout Kenya and around the world, using her expertise and experience as a professor to encourage social change. She is a tireless advocate for democracy and human rights, and is always willing to speak out against injustices wherever she finds them.

In crystallography, a periodic graph or crystal structure is a graph of the positions of atoms in a crystal as a function of time. The atoms are usually represented by points, and the lines connecting them show the relative positions of the atoms at different times. The lines are usually drawn on an X-Y plane, with X being the horizontal axis and Y being the vertical axis. The line describing the atomic position at any given time is called a coordinate line or simply a coordinate.

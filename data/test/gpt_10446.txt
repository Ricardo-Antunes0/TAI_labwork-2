He attended Melbourne High School and then the National Gallery of Victoria School of Art, where he studied under Arthur Boyd and Noel Mewton. He won a scholarship to study at the Royal Academy of Art in London in 1938, but the outbreak of World War II prevented him from leaving. In 1941 he enlisted in the Australian Army and served in North Africa and Italy. After the war he resumed his studies at the Royal Academy, graduating with a BFA in 1948.  Taylor's early work was figurative, but he soon began exploring abstraction and non-representational painting. In 1957 he moved to Sydney and began teaching at the National Art School there. In 1979 he was awarded a D.Litt from the University of New South Wales. He died in Sydney on 7 October 2006.

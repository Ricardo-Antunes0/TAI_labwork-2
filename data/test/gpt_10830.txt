Buildings is the debut album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Ryan Adams. It was released on September 24, 2000, by Lost Highway Records.  Adams recorded Buildings in his home studio in Bangor, Northern Ireland, with help from a few local musicians. The album features Adams' acoustic guitar and vocals, as well as occasional keyboards and drumming from his then-girlfriend Meg White.  The album has been described as indie rock or alternative country, and has been noted for its sparse production and Adams' emotive vocals. The songs are about Adams' personal experiences – such as the break-up of his first relationship – and are often melancholic or introspective.  The album was well received by critics, who praised Adams' vocal abilities and the album's eclectic mix of sound. However, it failed to chart in the United States or the United Kingdom.  Today, Buildings is Adams' most acclaimed album, praised by music critics for its emotive lyrics and sparse production. It has been cited as a major influence by later indie rock artists such as Hozier and The Paper Kites.

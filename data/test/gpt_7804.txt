The Canadian Shift is a chain shift that takes place in the Canadian labour market. It is the result of a mismatch between the skills and requirements of employers and the skills and qualifications of the labour force. The Canadian Shift has resulted in a large number of workers who are over-qualified for their current positions, and a shortage of skilled labour in certain sectors.

Susan Groag Bell (25 January 1926 â€“ 24 June 2015) was a Czech-American pioneer in Women's Studies. At a time when there were no academic courses nor textbooks, offered in women's history, Bell compiled images of women's participation in society from artworks and began presenting lectures to present roles women had held in society. In 1971, a year after the first women's studies course was offered in the United States, Bell taught her own class on the subject and prepared a reading guide for the course which would become one of the first textbooks to treat women's history from an academic perspective. She taught and researched for more than four decades as an independent scholar at the Clayman Institute for Gender Research. Posthumously, a conference named in her honor was held at Stanford University and a plaque recognizing her contributions to women's history was dedicated by the history department of Stanford. Early life Susan Groag was born on 25 January 1926 in Troppau (now known as Opava), in the German-speaking Sudetenland area of Czechoslovakia. Her father was a lawyer and both of her parents had Jewish heritage, though they converted to Lutheranism. In 1938, when the Germans annexed Sudetenland, Groag was no longer allowed to go to school. To protect his wife and daughter, Groag's father arranged a visa for his wife to work as a domestic in England, and dispatched them via train from Prague in January 1939. While her mother worked as a maid, they tried to arrange a visa for Groag's father, but were unsuccessful. He was unable to leave Czechoslovakia and was one of the victims of the Theresienstadt concentration camp.

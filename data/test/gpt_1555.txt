Principled Distance is a new model of epistemic justification for belief. It is based on the principle that justification should be based on the degree to which the belief is justified, not on the degree to which the belief is held.  Principled Distance provides a principled way of distinguishing between different types of belief and allows us to make more informed decisions about what beliefs to hold. It can help us to avoid falling into fallacies of bias and保持正确的理性距离。  Principled Distance has a number of applications in philosophy, including in debates about religious and moral beliefs, epistemology, and scientific theories.

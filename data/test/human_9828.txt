Noel Harry Leaver (23 March 1889 â€“ 24 July 1951) was an English painter and teacher. Early life and training Leaver was born at the School House in Austwick, West Riding of Yorkshire where his father Peter was a teacher. Soon after the family returned to Worsthorne near Burnley in Lancashire. He was educated at St. James School and the Burnley School of Art. He won a National Scholarship to the Royal College of Art at age 16, receiving his full associateship at 21. Towards the end of this time he was awarded a Travelling Scholarship which enabled him to travel to Italy for 6 months (May - October 1911) where he studied painting and architecture. This was followed early the following year with a second travelling scholarship this time awarded by RIBA (Royal Institute of British Architects), the Owen Jones Studentship, which took him back to Italy and from there to North Africa (February - August 1912).

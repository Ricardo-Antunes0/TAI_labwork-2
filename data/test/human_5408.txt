The Gemil Box is a multi-format box set, self-financed and self-released on 18 November 2013 by the Northern Irish rock band Therapy?. The box was announced on the official site for pre-sale on 23 October, and the track-listing was revealed on 14 November. It contains remastered CD versions of four previously released A&M Records albums (Nurse, Troublegum, Infernal Love, and Semi Detached); two discs of previously unreleased material recorded between 1989 and 2011; a disc of demos and reworked songs; a DVD featuring the band's UK Sonisphere 2010 performance and two early home video bootlegs from London in 1991 and 1992; a 12" vinyl containing all 16 of the band's original demo songs; and a cassette of an early live performance from Dublin in 1990. Also included is a 24-page book with pictures and notes by original members Andy Cairns and Michael McKeegan, and download codes for the vinyl and cassette. A limited edition release, the box was sold only via the band's official website and included a signed photograph with all pre-orders placed before 16 November 2013. As from November 2015, all remaining copies were only available from Amazon.

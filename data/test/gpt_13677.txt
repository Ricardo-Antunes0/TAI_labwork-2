Pyramid Electric Co. is the first full-length electric guitar manufacturer in the United States. Founded in 1891, the company was originally known as the Pyramid Guitar Manufacturing Company.  Pyramid Electric Co. was founded in 1891 by Charles D. Russell and George W. Fullerton. The company's first product was a guitar built on a design by Fullerton. The Pyramid Guitar Manufacturing Company became Pyramid Electric Co. in 1902.  The company's early products were primarily acoustic guitars, but it soon began producing electric guitars as well. In 1915, the company produced its first electric guitar with a pick-up, and by 1927 it had introduced its first solid-body electric guitar. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Pyramid Electric Co. became one of the leading manufacturers of electric guitars in the United States.  In 1960, the company merged with Fender Musical Instruments Corporation to form Fender Electric Instruments Corporation. Pyramid Electric Co. continued to produce electric guitars under the Fender brand until 1978, when it was folded into Fender Musical Instruments Corporation's Guitar Center division.  Today, Pyramid Electric Co. is a subsidiary of Fender Musical Instruments Corporation and is still one of the leading manufacturers of electric guitars in the United States.

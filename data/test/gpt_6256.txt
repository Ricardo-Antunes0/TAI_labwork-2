The Red Desert is a high-altitude desert in the U.S. state of Wyoming. Located in the southwest corner of the state, it is bordered by the Rocky Mountains to the west and the Black Hills to the north. The desert is named for its reddish soils, which are due to iron oxide and other minerals that were deposited during the last ice age.     The Red Desert covers a total area of about 1,000 square miles (2,600 square kilometers). It is about 120 miles (190 kilometers) long and 50 miles (80 kilometers) wide. Its highest elevation is 12,711 feet (3,827 meters) above sea level at Mount Evans, just south of Grand Teton National Park.

Tarrytown is a neighborhood located west of downtown Austin, Texas, United States. The neighborhood is bounded by Interstate 35 to the north, Interstate 35 to the east, MoPac Expressway to the south, and Interstate 35 to the west.  The name Tarrytown is derived from the Tarrytown settlement which was established in 1837 on a tract of land that had been granted by Stephen F. Austin. The settlement was originally called "Piney Point" but was renamed in honor of New York politician and diplomat Tarrytown after the town of Tarrytown in Westchester County, New York.   Tarrytown is known for its Victorian-era homes and its small-town atmosphere. The neighborhood has a strong history as a farming community and has retained much of its historic character. Today, Tarrytown is home to many businesses and organizations, including the Austin Public Library, which is located in the historic Fairmount building.

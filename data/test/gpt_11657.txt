Christopher Trotman "Trot" Nixon (born April 11, 1934) is an American politician who served as the 37th President of the United States from 1969 to 1974, succeeding Richard M. Nixon. A Republican, he was the only U.S. President to resign in office, after being found guilty of obstruction of justice and abuse of power in the Watergate scandal.  Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, California. After studying at Whittier College and Duke University, he worked in local politics in California before winning election to the House of Representatives in 1962. He served two terms before being elected to the Senate in 1968, where he served for two more terms. He became Vice President in 1969, and succeeded to the presidency upon Richard Nixon's resignation due to the Watergate scandal in 1974. In his second term, he enacted some of his most controversial policies, including wage and price controls, re-organization of the government into executive departments, and increased funding for social programs. He lost his bid for a third term in 1976 to Jimmy Carter, who later named him Ambassador to Canada. Nixon returned to politics in 1980, winning election to the House of Representatives. He served there until his retirement in 1989.

Strata is an American rock band from Campbell, California, United States, formed in 2000, when guitarist Ryan Hernandez and singer Eric Victorino met and left their previous bands. Bassist Hrag Chanchanian and drummer Patrick Spain completed the line-up under the band's original name, Downside. The band released an EP entitled "For Testing Purposes" and an album called Sleep in 2001. Garnering major label attention early on, Downside signed a development deal with Capitol Records, during which time they replaced drummer Patrick Spain with Adrian Robison and recorded a collection of songs called, The Industry Is Outnumbered... Their Factories Are Burning Down, much of which would become their major label debut, under the name Strata, on Wind-Up Records in 2003. They released two albums with Wind-up Records, before disbanding after the departure of vocalist Eric Victorino on 19 January 2008. In 2014, the band reunited, minus Adrian Robison on drums, replaced by longtime friend of the band Andy Bailey.

Griha Pravesh is a Hindu ceremony performed to invoke the blessings of a particular deity or deities. The ceremony is usually performed at home, and may involve prayers, offerings of flowers or food, and chanting of hymns or mantras.  The word "graha" means "column" or "pillar", and pravesh refers to the act of propitiating or requesting a deity's blessings. A Graha Pravesh is typically performed in order to ask for good health, prosperity, and protection from danger. It is also commonly used to thank a deity for favors received.  The ceremony can be performed with any Hindu deity, but is most commonly done with Vishnu, Shiva, or Devi. The specific terms used to invoke the deity's blessings vary depending on the region and caste of the practitioner. Some common terms include "Namaste", "Aum Namah Shivaya", and "Hari Om."

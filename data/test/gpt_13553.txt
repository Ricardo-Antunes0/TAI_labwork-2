The Art Museum Partnership (2005â€“2012) was a New York City-based nonprofit organization that aimed to promote and support the work of art museums in New York City through the development and implementation of innovative programs.  The Art Museum Partnership was founded in 2005 by a group of art museum professionals, with the goal of addressing the critical shortage of exhibition space and resources in New York City. Through the organization's various initiatives, which included the creation of an exhibition database and programmatic grants, the Art Museum Partnership hoped to support and grow the city's art museums.  The Art Museum Partnership ceased operations in 2012.

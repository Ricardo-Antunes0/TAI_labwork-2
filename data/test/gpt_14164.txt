KSKN, virtual channel 22 (UHF digital channel 20), is a MyNetworkTV-affiliated television station licensed to Santa Clarita, California, United States. The station is owned by the Nexstar Broadcasting Group, as part of a duopoly with fellow MyNetworkTV affiliate KTLV (channel 22). The two stations share studios on Ventura Boulevard in Santa Clarita; KSKN's transmitter is located in the Simi Valley.  KKSN first signed on the air on December 10, 1991 as KCET-TV. The station was founded by the Children's Television Workshop (CTW) as a charter affiliate of CTW's children's programming service PBS Kids. In 2003, KCET became an affiliate of MyNetworkTV when the network launched that year. In 2006, KCET rebranded its digital signal as "MyKCET".  On March 22, 2013, Nexstar Broadcasting Group announced that it had agreed to purchase KCET from CTW for $13 million. The sale was completed on May 10. On September 12, 2013, Nexstar announced that it would merge KSKN and KTLV into a shared services agreement; the combined station would be branded as "KSKN/22". The new branding took effect on October 1.  On October 3, 2017, Nexstar announced it would sell KSKN and KTLV to the Bonten Media Group for $130 million. The deal was completed on December 20.

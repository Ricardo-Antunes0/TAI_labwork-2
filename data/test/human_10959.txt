Christ Church Glendower is the oldest (and most centrally located) of the historic Episcopal church buildings in St. Anne's Parish, Albemarle County, Virginia near Scottsville. Christ Church Glendower is located in Keene, built of brick in 1831 in the Roman Revival style. It features a full Doric order entablature with pediments at each end containing lunette windows, and is surrounded by a contributing cemetery. The remaining two historic churches in St. Anne's parish are also discussed below. History In the second quarter of the 18th century, European settlement expanded upstream following the James River into the area which today comprises Albemarle County. In 1732, Edward Scott (1700-1738), a burgess from Goochland County, laid claim to (patented) 550 acres west of what became the town, and established a ferry across the James River to what in 1761 became Buckingham County. Scott's Landing (which became Scottsville) is now split between Fluvanna and Albemarle Counties, but was once a major port on a horseshoe bend of the James River, particularly during the heyday of the James River Canal, which opened in 1840 and became unnavigable during the American Civil War.

A bu単uelo (; alternatively called bimuelo, birmuelo, burmuelo, or bu単uelillo) is a sweet dessert or snack in Spain and Latin America. It is a type of dulce de leche cake, made with flour, sugar, milk, eggs and butter. The dough is often shaped into a ball, then deep-fried or baked.  Although the word "bu単uelo" means "little balls," it can also refer to the cake itself, which can be either round or square. In Spain, bu単uelos are often dipped in chocolate or caramel. In Latin America, they are commonly filled with whipped cream and covered in chocolate or caramel.

The Christmas Wife is a 1988 American drama film directed by David Jones and written by Catherine Ann Jones. It stars Jason Robards, Julie Harris, Don Francks, James Eckhouse, Patricia Hamilton and Deborah Grover. The film premiered on HBO on December 12, 1988. Plot John Tanner (Robards), a retired architect who is recently widowed, decides to look for a platonic lady companion for the Christmas period at his lakeside cabin (as he always had with his deceased wife), instead of flying out west to see his son and his family. He meets a "social arranger" (Francks) who introduces him to a woman of about his own age, Iris (Harris). They meet at a hotel lobby/plaza in town and she tells him she would like to go ahead, but that they should meet later at the local bus depot before departing for the holiday. She is insistent that he does not ask her any personal questions.

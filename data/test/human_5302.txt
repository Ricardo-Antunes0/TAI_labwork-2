Borsalino is a 1970 French gangster film directed by Jacques Deray and starring Alain Delon, Jean-Paul Belmondo and Catherine Rouvel. It was entered into the 20th Berlin International Film Festival. In 2009, Empire named it No. 19 in a poll of "The 20 Greatest Gangster Movies You've Never Seen… Probably". A sequel, Borsalino & Co., was released in 1974 with Alain Delon in the leading role. The film is based on real-life gangsters Paul Carbone and François Spirito, who collaborated with Nazi Germany during the occupation of France in World War II (though this is not mentioned in the film). It was being shown on BBC1 in the United Kingdom on 31 August 1997 when it was interrupted at 1.45am by BBC newsreader Martyn Lewis to bring the first news report that Diana, Princess of Wales, had been involved in a car crash in Paris, which ultimately claimed her life. (With cruel irony, the film was in the middle of a scene that depicted a funeral.) The film would be interrupted one more time in the following hour for another update about the crash.

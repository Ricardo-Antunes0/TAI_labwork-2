The Pelican Nebula (also known as IC 4406) is a vast star-forming region in the constellation Pelican. It is located about 5,500 light years from Earth and is estimated to be about 100,000 light years across. The nebula is often used as an example of a "open cluster", a type of star-forming region where stars are born together from the collapse of gas and dust clouds.  The Pelican Nebula was first observed by German astronomer Johann Elert Bode in 1786 and was named after the pelican, a bird known for its long neck and bill. The nebula is sometimes seen as a symbol of hope, because it is home to more than 1,500 young stars.

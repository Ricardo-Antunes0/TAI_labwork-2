Burton D. Katz (7 July 1937, Chicago, Illinois – 10 March 2000, Cambridge, Massachusetts) was an American mathematician and computer scientist who made important contributions to the theory of computation.  Katz was born in Chicago, Illinois. He received his undergraduate degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1959, and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1964. He worked at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center from 1966 to 1988, and at the University of Cambridge from 1988 until his death in 2000.  Katz is best known for his work on algorithms and data structures, especially for the development of Huffman coding and for the Katz–Humphrey algorithm for computing minimum spanning trees. He also made important contributions to the theory of Computability Theory, Algorithmic Game Theory, and Automata Theory, Random Structures and Algorithms.

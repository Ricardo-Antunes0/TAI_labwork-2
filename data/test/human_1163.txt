R. J. Adams, also known as Bob Shannon (September 20, 1942 â€“ January 26, 2015), was a Canadian-American film and television actor, acting coach, screen writer, film producer, documentary producer and radio personality. Beginnings Adams was born in St. Catharines, Ontario, where he spent his early childhood, until his family headed across the border to Niagara Falls, New York. Known to his friends as Bob Adams, the aspiring actor/radio DJ spent just a couple of years attending Bishop Duffy High School before dropping out and moving to New York City at the age of 17 to study acting. Upon his arrival on the west coast, he landed a job as a page at NBC Burbank which led to a radio job in Phoenix and ultimately a twenty-five-year career in broadcasting as Bob Shannon.  His on-air career included radio stations in markets such as Buffalo, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Seattle, Minneapolis/St. Paul, San Diego and Los Angeles. It was while working at KFI (AM) in the mid-1970s that Adams turned his attention back to film acting.

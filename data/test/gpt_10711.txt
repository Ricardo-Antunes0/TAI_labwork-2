Zuzana Chalupová (; 5 February 1925 – 5 January 1998) was a Czechoslovak-born Slovak singer, actress and politician.  Born in Levoča, then a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Chalupová first started performing in amateur theatres in her home town when she was just thirteen years old. She made her professional debut in 1948, and quickly became one of the most popular artists in Slovakia. Her career reached its heights during the 1960s and 1970s, when she starred in a number of successful films and recordings. Chalupová also became well known for her political activism, and served twice as the president of the Slovak Republic (1987–90 and 1992–96). She died from cancer in 1998 at the age of 73.

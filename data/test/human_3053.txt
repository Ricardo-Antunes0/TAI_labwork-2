Reciprocity in electrical networks is a property of a circuit that relates voltages and currents at two points.  The reciprocity theorem states that the current at one point in a circuit due to a voltage at a second point is the same as the current at the second point due to the same voltage at the first.  The reciprocity theorem is valid for almost all passive networks.  The reciprocity theorem is a feature of a more general principle of reciprocity in electromagnetism. Description  If a current, , injected into port A produces a voltage, , at port B and  injected into port B produces  at port A, then the network is said to be reciprocal.  Equivalently, reciprocity can be defined by the dual situation; applying voltage, , at port A producing current  at port B and  at port B producing current  at port A.  In general, passive networks are reciprocal.  Any network that consists entirely of ideal capacitances, inductances (including mutual inductances), and resistances, that is, elements that are linear and bilateral, will be reciprocal.  However, passive components that are non-reciprocal do exist.  Any component containing ferromagnetic material is likely to be non-reciprocal.  Examples of passive components deliberately designed to be non-reciprocal include circulators and isolators.

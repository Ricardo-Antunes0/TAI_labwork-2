The TV Wheel is a 1995 television game show hosted by Wink Martindale.  The show was produced by FremantleMedia North America and aired on CBS.  Six contestants competed in a series of rounds, with the first three playing for money and the final three playing for prizes. The contestants played a game called "Wheel of Fortune" on a large wheel that spun to determine the contestant's next game. The first player to buzz in and solve the puzzle won money, while the other players lost money.  The first prize was $10,000, the second prize was $5,000, and the third prize was $2,500.  The show ran for four seasons and aired from 1995 to 1998.

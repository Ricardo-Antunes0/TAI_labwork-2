Shoot the Moon is a 1982 American science fiction film directed by Michael Anderson and starring Sam Elliott, Melanie Griffith, and Max Von Sydow.  The film is set in the future after a nuclear war has destroyed most of Earth's surface. A small group of survivors live in a subterranean city, where they trade goods with a surface community that has been reduced to a primitive state. One night, a group of raiders from the surface enter the city and attempt to take all the food. The mayor (Elliott) leads a group of citizens in an attack on the raiders, but they are outnumbered and defeated. The mayor decides to take his family and go live on the surface.  On the surface, the family finds that life has reverted to a more primitive state. The mayor begins trading goods with the raiders in order to keep them safe from other tribes who may seek to attack them. One day, while trading goods with the raiders, the mayor's son is captured by one of their members. The mayor tracks down his son and kills the member who took him. He then returns his son to the tribe and resumes trading goods with them.

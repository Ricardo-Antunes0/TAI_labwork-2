Lada class, Russian designation Project 677 Lada (, meaning "Lada", NATO reporting name St. Petersburg) is the new advanced class of diesel-electric attack submarine designed by the Russian Rubin Design Bureau. A program to develop a "fourth generation" diesel-electric submarine, it aimed to produce a highly improved version of the Project 636 with better acoustic signature, new combat systems and possibly air-independent propulsion. However, in 2019, Alexander Buzakov, the head of the Admiralty Shipyard, indicated that there were no plans to equip the Lada class with an air-independent propulsion system. History The lead boat of the class, named , was launched in October 2004 and began sea trials in November 2005. The submarine was transferred to the Russian Navy in April 2010. Another two vessels were under construction at the Admiralty Shipyard with plans to launch four to six submarines by 2015. The Russian Navy had set out a requirement for a total of eight St. Petersburg-class submarines.

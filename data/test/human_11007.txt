The Universal Logistics Standard is a strategic framework for managing disaster response among local, state, regional and federal disaster response personnel.  Its intended use is as a foundation on which local, state and federal emergency management stakeholders can build a comprehensive disaster logistics program. The Universal Logistics Standard was developed by the Regional Logistics Program under the oversight of the NY-NJ-CT-PA Regional Catastrophic Planning Team, which is funded as part of the US Department of Homeland Security's Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grant Program to support all-hazard planning and coordination of response for catastrophic events. Background  In 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated the U.S. Gulf Coast and posed serious logistical challenges to the governmental agencies, volunteer organizations, private sector partners and individual citizens that were active in the response and recovery operations. While the magnitude of the Hurricane Katrina disaster is widely considered a key factor for the logistics failures that ensued in its aftermath, evaluations and research on the logistical response by all levels of government identified the following key shortcomings:  Near total failure in regional communications created problems with agency coordination and response logistics.  Government agencies were not adequately staffed with personnel who had experience or skills in complex logistics operations.  Near non-existent integration between state and federal logistics systems encouraged state and local response officials to abandon the established plans and procedures for requesting and managing critical supplies and resources.  Critical supplies, resources and assets were not effectively prepositioned to support the required response.  Planning for the handling and distribution of donations was insufficient.  Procurement delays, due to bureaucratic requirements at all levels of government and the lack of purchasing agreements with suppliers.  Asset visibility was almost totally obstructed throughout all points in emergency supply chains.

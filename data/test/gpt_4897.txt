In the United States, an honor society is a group of college students who have earned academic honors. The most common honor societies are the Alpha Kappa Psi fraternity and sorority, the Phi Beta Kappa society, and the Tau Beta Pi engineering honor society.  There are many different types of honors societies, but all honor societies have three things in common: they are selective, they are based on academic achievement, and they provide a sense of community amongst their members.   The first step to becoming an honorary member of a society is to be nominated by a current member. Once nominated, the applicant must pass a screening process that looks for both academic and personal qualities that make them worthy of membership.   Once accepted as a honorary member, honorary members are given several benefits, including access to exclusive clubhouses and discounts on student fees. In addition, honorary members are often asked to give speeches or serve on committees. Membership in an honor society can be a valuable honor, and many students strive to become honorary members of as many societies as possible.

The operation was launched in response to an increase in militant activity in the area, including the execution of two Iranian security guards by ISIL militants in February 2017. The operation involved the deployment of around 100 Iranian soldiers and militia members, as well as a number of Iranian Air Force helicopters and artillery pieces. The operation was successful, with all involved militants being killed or captured.

In engineering, iso-elastic refers to a system of elastic and tensile parts (springs and pulleys) which are arranged in a configuration which isolates physical motion at one end in order to minimize or prevent similar motion from occurring at the other end. This type of device must be able to maintain angular direction and load-bearing over a large range of motion. The most prominent use of an iso-elastic system is in the supporting armature of a Steadicam, used to isolate a film or video camera from the operator's movements.  Steadicam arms all work in a fashion similar to a spring lamp since each arm has two sections (similar to and labelled like a human arm); both the upper and fore-arm sections consist of a parallelogram with a diagonal iso-elastic cable-pulley-spring system. The iso-elastic system is tensioned to counteract the weight of the camera and steadicam sled. This tensioning allows the camera and operator to move vertically and independently of each other. For example, as the operator runs, the bouncing of his body is absorbed by the springs, keeping the camera steady. The arm also has unsprung hinges at both ends of each arm allowing it to bend in the horizontal plane (just like your elbow, not like a spring lamp).

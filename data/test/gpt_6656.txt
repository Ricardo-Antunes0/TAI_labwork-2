The quality of health in Rwanda has improved steadily over the past few decades, thanks in part to effective public health measures and a well-developed health system. However, there are still areas in which Rwanda needs to improve, particularly in terms of access to essential health services and in terms of the quality of care provided.  Rwanda has a population of just over 10 million people, and is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa. Life expectancy at birth is estimated to be 67 years, and women have a life expectancy of around 79 years. The infant mortality rate is estimated to be around 50 deaths per 1000 live births, which is lower than the African average. In terms of HIV/AIDS prevalence, Rwanda has a rate of 0.5%, which is lower than the African average.

Rwanda has made significant strides in addressing HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, and has achieved low HIV/AIDS prevalence rates among adults. Nevertheless, more work needs to be done to prevent and treat hypertension and other heart diseases, reduce maternal mortality rates, and increase access to reproductive health services.

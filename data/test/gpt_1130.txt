Police accountability involves holding both individual police officers and police departments accountable for their actions. Accountability can take the form of public reports, investigations, or trials.  There are multiple ways to hold police officers accountable for their actions. One way is through public reports. This is when the media publishes information about specific incidents or cases involving police officers. This can help to hold the officers accountable to the public, and it can also help to create a better understanding of how police officers operate.  Another way to hold police officers accountable is through investigations. Investigations are carried out by independent bodies such as the Inspector General of Police (IGP) in some countries, or by special commissions in others. They aim to determine whether any laws have been broken, and if so, to identify the responsible parties.  Finally, police accountability can be brought about through trials. Trials are held in courts of law to determine whether someone has committed a crime. They can be open to the public, and they can provide a more detailed account of what happened than public reports or investigations can.

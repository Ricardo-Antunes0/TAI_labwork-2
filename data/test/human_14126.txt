The film was released with an attached 3D Looney Tunes short entitled I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat, based on the 1950 children's song of the same name, starring Sylvester and Tweety, with archival recordings by the legendary Mel Blanc. Another Looney Tunes short, Daffy's Rhapsody, starring Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd, was supposed to premiere with the film, but was switched in production. That short instead premiered with Journey 2: The Mysterious Island in 2012. The film received mixed reviews and grossed just $150 million against its $135 million budget (not including marketing costs), becoming a box office bomb which resulted in the closure of Miller's Dr. D Studios, making this their first and only animated film.

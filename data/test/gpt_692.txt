The Piaśnica is a river in northern Poland, a tributary of the Vistula. It is long, has a drainage basin of , and flows through the towns of Szczecin and Świnoujście.  The Piaśnica has been used for transportation since ancient times. In the Middle Ages it was one of the most important routes linking the Baltic Sea with the Vistula River basin. The river served as a natural border between two principalities—the Kingdom of Poland and the Duchy of Pomerania—and it was also a key transportation route linking these two powers. After World War II, the Piaśnica was heavily damaged by floodings and industrial pollution. However, since the late 1990s, environmental restoration efforts have succeeded in improving water quality and wildlife populations in parts of its watershed.

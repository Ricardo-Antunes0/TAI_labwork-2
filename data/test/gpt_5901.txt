A veinticuatro (meaning Twenty-four) or 'Caballero Veintiquatro' (Knight Twenty-four) is a title of nobility in Spain and Portugal.  The title veintiquatro is conferred upon a person who has exhibited exemplary merit and gallantry in the military, civil or social spheres. The veintiquatro is the lowest rank of the Spanish military order of knighthood, the Order of the Golden Fleece. The Portuguese order of knighthood, the Order of Christ, also has a veintiquatro rank.   The veintiquatro may be awarded to both men and women. The title is often translated as "Knight Twenty-four", although this translation can be misleading because there are actually twenty-one knights in the Spanish order of knighthood, while there are only 24 members in the Portuguese order of knighthood.

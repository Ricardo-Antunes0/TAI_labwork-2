Paestum Airfield is an abandoned World War II military airfield in Italy, located approximately 9Â km north-northeast of Agropoli, in the province of Salerno, in the Campania region of Italy. It was an all-weather temporary field built by the United States Army Air Force XII Engineer Command using a graded earth compacted surface, with a prefabricated hessian (burlap) surfacing known as PHS. PHS was made of an asphalt-impregnated jute which was rolled out over the compacted surface over a square mesh track (SMT) grid of wire joined in 3-inch squares.   Pierced Steel Planking was also used for parking areas, as well as for dispersal sites, when it was available.   In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting.

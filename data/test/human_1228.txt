Abstract Theory is the debut solo album released by former Five member Abs. The album was released on 1 September 2003, peaking at No. 29 on the UK Albums Chart. The album failed to find success elsewhere, and resulted in Abs being dropped from his record label just months later. The album spawned five singles: "What You Got", "Stop Sign", "Shame", "7 Ways" and "Miss Perfect". The album received mixed to positive reviews from critics, comparing his material to that of his former band, Five. Background Abs began work on the album following Five's split in late 2001. He soon signed a record deal with Sony BMG, who had previously contracted Five on a three-album deal. The album's first single, "What You Got", was released in August 2002 to moderate success, peaking at No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart. The album's second single, "Shame", was scheduled for release in November 2002, but was subsequently only released in Australia after the record company decided to market "Stop Sign" as the second British single. Arriving in May 2003, the song peaked at No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart. A third single, "Miss Perfect", was released on 25 August 2003, a week prior to the album's release, peaking at No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart. A fourth single, "7 Ways", was planned for release in November 2003, with a music video being released and several copies made available in stores from 10 November. However, the single was recalled on 11 November, and just three weeks later, Abs was dropped from his record label.

The Lookout Air Raids were minor but significant air raids on the United Kingdom during World War II. They were conducted by the Luftwaffe in order to hamper the British war effort by bombing civilian targets such as factories and ports.  The Lookout Air Raids began in early 1940, when Germany began targeting British aircraft factories in an effort to cripple the country's defense capabilities. The raids continued sporadically until the end of the war, although their frequency decreased as Bomber Command began to achieve more significant successes against Germany.

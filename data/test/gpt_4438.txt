Of the three types of carburetors used in modern engines, the Bendix-Stromberg is perhaps the most popular. It is a simple design, consisting of a number of discs or plates that sit on top of the air pipe and supply fuel to the engine. The carburetor operates by sucking air into the engine and compressing it, which force fuel into the engine. The Bendix-Stromberg carburetor was first patented in 1923 and has been used in a wide variety of vehicles over the years.

The Breguet 901 Mouette  is a single seat French competition sailplane from the 1950s. It was the winner at both the 1954 and 1956 World Gliding Championships. Design and development Breguet's first sailplane, the Type 900, had some success in national competitions but failed to impress at the two World Championships of 1950 and 1952, partly because of its short wingspan.  The 901 is a development of this aircraft, retaining its mid wing layout and largely wooden construction. The wing of the 901 is straight tapered and built around a single spar, with a leading edge torsion box and fabric covered aft of the spar. On the 901 the torsion box was skinned with a plywood-klegecell (a plastic foam) sandwich rather than the ply of the 900. At 17.32 m (57 ft 8 in), its span is 2.97 m (9 ft 9 in) greater than the 900, raising the aspect ratio from 12.9 to 20.  There are long span, short chord slotted flaps inboard, mid-chord airbrakes and tips finished with small "salmon" fairings. Both designs have plywood skinned fuselages, though that of the 901 is longer in the nose where the cockpit has an extended, single piece canopy.

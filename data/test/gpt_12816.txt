The Relay program consisted of Relay 1, Relay 2 and Relay 3 satellites. Each satellite was equipped with a sophisticated satellite communications system that allowed it to relay messages between two or more other satellites.  The Relay program was created as part of the International Telecommunication Union's (ITU) effort to provide a global satellite communications system. The program began in 1969 and was completed in 1984. The Relay satellites were used to send messages between different parts of the world.

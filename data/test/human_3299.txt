Compaq SLT was a line of laptop computers made by Compaq. The SLT series was the successor to the Portable III and the predecessor to the more well known Compaq LTE. Two models were produced in the SLT series. The first model, named SLT/286, released on October 17, 1988, is considered to be one of the most notable units in laptop history due to its battery life and superior performance compared to competing models. It is also notable for being Compaq’s first laptop computer. The SLT/286 had a 12 MHz Harris or Intel 80C286 processor (both brands were used throughout the SLT/286’s production) and a grayscale VGA LCD screen, the very first laptop with this feature. The price started at $5,399 for the base-model. The second model, the SLT 386s/20, was released in 1990, and featured a 386SX 20MHz CPU, versus the 286 12MHz CPU of the SLT/286. It also came with 2MB of RAM standard, compared to the 640KB the SLT/286 came with, and a 60 or 120MB hard disk drive, rather than the 20 or 40MB options the SLT/286 offered.

Mossville is an unincorporated community between Peoria and Chillicothe in Peoria County, Illinois, United States. Mossville is part of the Peoria, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area and resides closely to the northern part of Peoria. Centered on the Illinois River valley and the end of Illinois Route 6 at Illinois Route 29, Mossville informally encompasses a number of different neighborhoods along the valley: Renchville, Brookview, a cluster of houses along the Illinois River referred to as "The Lanes" (though "The Lanes" are in the Peoria zip code of 61615), and Cedar Hills Estates, as well as the unincorporated village of 900 that can be considered Mossville proper.  The Lake of the Woods subdivision, as well as Colony Point, both on the west bluff of the Illinois River valley overlooking Mossville, can also be considered to be part of the greater Mossville area. It was previously served by the Rock Island Line at Mossville Station. Businesses Caterpillar Inc. located its Technical Research Center (Tech Center) in Mossville in the 1960s, and subsequently put production facilities (the Mossville plant, most of which no longer exists, due to Caterpillar relocating these facilities/jobs) there as well.  Caterpillar Electronics as well as the global mining technologies research and development are also located at Mossville. A co-operated Ameren/Caterpillar generation plant and a small industrial park also sits near the factories.

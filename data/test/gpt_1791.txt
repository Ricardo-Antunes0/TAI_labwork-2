Robert de Blois (fl. second third of the 12th century) was an Anglo-Norman troubadour. He is the earliest known composer of French chansons de geste.  Robert de Blois was born in about 1090, the son of a wealthy landowner in the Cotentin region of Normandy. He began writing poetry in his early twenties, and his first work, a chanson de geste called "Le Chevalier au Lion" (The Knight with the Lion), was published in about 1120. The chanson tells the story of a young knight who battles a lion and then wins the hand of a princess.  De Blois composed other chansons de geste, including "Le Chevalier sans Tête" (The Headless Knight), "La Belle au bois dormant" (The Sleeping Beauty), and "L'Oiseau Bleu" (The Blue Bird). He also wrote lyric poems, including "Le Prophète" (The Prophet) and "L'Alouette" (The Lark).  De Blois died in 1140 or 1141.

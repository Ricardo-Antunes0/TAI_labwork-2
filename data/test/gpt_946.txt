Nicolas Marie Alexandre Vattemare (1796 in Paris – 1868 in Paris) was a French painter, draftsman and lithographer.  Vattemare was the son of a sculptor and painter, Jean-Jacques Vattemare. He began his artistic training in his father's workshop and then studied at the École des Beaux-Arts under Jacques-Louis David. In 1824 he exhibited for the first time at the Salon and in 1828 he won the Prix de Rome. While in Rome, he studied under Giuseppe Bezzuoli and Francesco Hayez.  Upon his return to France, Vattemare became successful as a painter of history subjects, often depicting scenes from the French Revolution. He also produced portraits, including those of Napoléon I and of his second wife Marie Louise of Austria. In 1840 he exhibited at the Salons for the last time.  Vattemare was a prolific lithographer, producing more than two hundred plates between 1829 and 1865. He is best known for his illustrations for Honoré de Balzac's novels "La Comtesse de Ségur" (1837) and "Le Père Goriot" (1840).

Jake E. Lee (born Jakey Lou Williams, February 15, 1957) is an American guitarist signed to Frontiers Records. He is best known for playing with Ozzy Osbourne between 1982 and 1987 and later in Badlands with Ray Gillen. He formed the band Red Dragon Cartel in 2013. Their eponymous first album was released in January 2014 and entered at no. 69 on Billboard's Album Charts. He has also recorded solo works under his own nameâ€”examples being the instrumental album A Fine Pink Mist (1996) and cover album Retraced (2005). Musical education  Lee was born in Norfolk, Virginia, U.S. His father is of Welsh ancestry; his mother is of Japanese ancestry. His father was a jazz fan, while his mother was a classic music fan, and his older sister a pop music fan. Lee grew up in San Diego and was encouraged by his mother to take classical piano lessons as a child when he was six years old. With a lack of interest in piano, 13-year-old Lee found that he enjoyed playing his older sister's guitar. His older sister influenced his desire to play by introducing him to Jimi Hendrix, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin records. The first song he learned was "No Time" by The Guess Who. From there, he used what formal training he had from piano, along with a Mel Bay guitar method book and concentrated on becoming a self-taught rock guitarist. Catching on and quickly developing a talent for the guitar, Lee played in several high school bands, soon impressing fellow San Diego musicians with his style of playing.

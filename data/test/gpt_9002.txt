He studied medicine at the University of Montpellier, and later worked as a surgeon in Paris. In 1753, Fouquier published his first book, "Traité des maladies du sang". In this book, Fouquier described various diseases that were caused by blood contamination. His work helped to improve the understanding of blood-borne diseases.  In 1758, Fouquier wrote "L'Art de la guerre", which is considered to be one of the first treatises on military strategy. This book helped to revolutionize the way wars were fought. Fouquier also wrote "Traité des poisons" (1765), which is a comprehensive guide to the use of poisons in crime.  Fouquier died in Paris in 1768. He was widely respected for his work in forensic medicine, and his contributions to military strategy and poisonology remain widely influential today.

Pretty Addicted is an English electronic music group formed in London, England, in 2011. The project is the brainchild of Vicious Precious with a live band and a live drummer. History The band was started in late 2011 by Vicious Precious and Jim Main after the pair met at a club and discussed the prospect of Jim remixing one of Vicious's old band's songs, before talk shifted to starting a new project together. After performing around the UK, the band released their debut album, Filth, in June 2013, through DWA. Problems between the three members led to the departure of Ben some time in 2012, leaving Vicious the sole studio member of the band. They recruited "Dammit Dan" Heard and Sakura Dahmer to flesh out the live lineup in late 2012 as the band continued touring the UK, and, Europe throughout 2013 and 2014. They released their second album, It All Stems From Childhood directly in 2014 through an Indiegogo campaign. Harry Sutherland joined the band doing the live bass.

Croydon University Hospital, known from 1923 to 2006 as Croydon General Hospital, is a large acute general hospital in Croydon in south London. It is managed by the London Health NHS Foundation Trust.  The hospital has its origins in the Croydon Infirmary which was founded in 1818 by the Reverend George Stephenson. The infirmary was enlarged by the addition of an annex in 1876 and a new wing was opened in 1923. The hospital became known as Croydon General Hospital in 1967 following the merger of Croydon Infirmary, Croydon Hospital and Addington Hospital. In 2006, it underwent a Â£140 million redevelopment which resulted in the opening of a new emergency department, surgery and maternity units. The redevelopment also created accommodation for elderly patients and created a new training centre for NHS staff.

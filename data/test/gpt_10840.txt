Dukhan Ram (1899â€“1990) was an Indian ophthalmologist, who is considered the father of modern ophthalmology. He was the first Indian to receive a medical degree in ophthalmology from the University of Cambridge. He also served as the Director General of Medical Services in the Government of India.  Dukhan Ram was born on 18 September 1899 in a small town in Rajasthan, India. After completing his secondary education at a local school, he enrolled at the University of Cambridge to study medicine. While there, he became interested in ophthalmology and graduated with his medical degree in 1925.  Following his graduation, Dukhan Ram served as an assistant professor at the Delhi College of Medicine and Surgery for two years. In 1928, he moved to the Government Medical College, Chandigarh, where he served as the head of the ophthalmology department for nearly three decades. During that time, he pioneered many advances in ophthalmology and also helped to establish Chandigarh as one of India's leading medical centers.  In 1962, Dukhan Ram retired from his position at the Government Medical College and returned to his home town in Rajasthan. There, he continued to work as a doctor until his death on 30 December 1990 at the age of 93. He was widely recognized as one of India's leading experts on ophthalmology and is credited with playing a major role in developing that field into what it is today.

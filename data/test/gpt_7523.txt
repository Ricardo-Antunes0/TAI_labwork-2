The Cursed Palace also known as The Forbidden Palace, is a palace located in Beijing, China. It served as the royal palace of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty from 1271 until 1280.  The palace was built in the early 13th century on the ruins of an earlier palace by Emperor Jenghiz Khan of the Mongol Empire. The Mongols were forced to abandon the palace in 1271 when they were defeated by the forces of Kublai Khan, who became the new Mongol emperor.  The Forbidden Palace was never used by the Qing Dynasty, which ruled China from 1644 until 1912. In 1912, during World War I, it was occupied by Japanese forces and used as a military headquarters. After the war, it was returned to Chinese control.  The Cursed Palace is now a museum and tourist attraction.

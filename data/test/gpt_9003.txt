Tropical Cyclone Bingiza was the only named storm of the year in the Southern Hemisphere. Bingiza developed from a low pressure area on November 20, 2014, in the Bay of Bengal. The storm intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on November 24, and reached its peak intensity with winds of 165 mph on November 26. Bingiza subsequently weakened as it moved westward across the Arabian Sea, and dissipated on December 1.  Bingiza caused significant damage throughout Oman and Yemen, leaving at least 55 people dead and hundreds injured. The storm also impacted India, where it killed two people and left tens of thousands homeless.

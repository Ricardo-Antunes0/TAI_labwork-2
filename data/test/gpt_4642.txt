Yanic Bercier Ph.D is a Canadian physicist and a professor at the University of Ottawa. He is known for his work on quantum information and communication, and has made significant contributions to the development of quantum cryptography and quantum error correction.  Bercier obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Geneva in 2002, under the supervision of Claude Shannon. After postdoctoral studies at the University of Paris-Sud (Orsay), he joined the University of Ottawa in 2004, where he is currently a Professor in the Department of Physics and in the School of Engineering.  Bercier's research focuses on quantum information and communication, with a particular focus on the development of quantum cryptography and quantum error correction algorithms. His work has led to significant advances in our understanding of these phenomena, which have gone on to have broad applications in fields such as data security, information theory, and optical networks.  Bercier has been awarded numerous prestigious awards and grants, including the Canada Research Chair in Quantum Information Processing (2010), the Killam Research Award (2012), and the Pritzker Prize (2015). He was also named one of Canada's Top 100 Most Powerful Men by Maclean's magazine in 2016.

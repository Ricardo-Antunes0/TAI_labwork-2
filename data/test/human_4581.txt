The Bunny Museum  is a museum dedicated to rabbits that was opened to the public in 1998, located in a mid-century building in Altadena, California, US. The museum currently holds more than 35,000 rabbit-related items. Amongst the ever-expanding collection there are ceramic rabbits, stuffed rabbits, cookie-jar rabbits and 9 Rose Parade float rabbits. The strangest pieces may be the freeze-dried rabbits, which were once household pets and are now kept in a glass display case. The museum has held the world record for "owning the most bunny items in the world" since 1999 when it was acknowledged by Guinness World Records. At that point in time, it housed 8,473 pieces of rabbit memorabilia. The slogan of the museum is "The Hoppiest Place in the World". The museum was co-founded by married couple Candace Frazee and Steve Lubanski, who started collecting the items after they began a tradition of giving each other new rabbit-themed gifts every day. Originally housed in the couple's residential home in Pasadena, the museum relocated to larger premises in Altadena in 2017.

Roger Demment (born 1950) is a former American ice hockey coach who is currently an associate athletic director for Dartmouth College, the University he coached in the early- and mid-1990s. Career Roger Demment was a member of the Yale's men's ice hockey team in the early 1970s. While the Bulldogs didn't have much success while Roger was there he was named captain of the team for his senior season. After graduating Demment headed overseas to act as a player-coach for the Briançon Red Devils of the French Division II. Demment stayed with the team for three seasons before returning to the states to take over at his high school alma mater, Trinity-Pawling School. Two years later, however, he was back in Briançon, playing for one final campaign before hanging up his skates, though he remained as coach of the Red Devils until 1981. While in France he was also appointed as regional program director for French Ministry of Youth and Sport. Demment eventually headed back to North America to earn a Master's degree from Wisconsin in 1986. He returned to coaching high school hockey as well, leading St. Mark's School from 1985-1990 before getting his first opportunity at the college level.

Jazz for Peanuts: A Retrospective of the Charlie Brown TV Themes is a compilation album released in the U.S. by Peak Records in October 2008. The album is credited to David Benoit and contains a mix of previously released material plus newly recorded songs featured in prime-time animated television specials based on the Peanuts comic strip by Charles M. Schulz. Critical reception AllMusic critic Thom Jurek called the album an "odd duck", saying it is "all the better for it". Jurek noted that Benoit "succeeded the late Vince Guaraldi as the musical director for the Peanuts television specials, meaning that his 50th anniversary recording of Guaraldi's music wasn't a simple tribute, but a nod to his predecessor". Jurek also noted that both Benoit's compositions, as well as Guaraldi's classic melodies, "were newly recorded live in the studio, lending them their timeless lyric quality and immediacy of presence". All About Jazz critic Woodrow Wilkins noted how the "symbiotic relationship between pianist David Benoit and Peanuts" is a "blessing for fans of both the animated series and jazz".

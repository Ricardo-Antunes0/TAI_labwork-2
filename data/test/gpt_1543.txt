Granville Roland Fortescue (October 12, 1875 – February 5, 1957) was an English lawyer and writer.  Born in London, Fortescue was the son of Augustus John Fortescue, a barrister and judge who served as Lord Chancellor of England from 1922 to 1923, and his wife, Maud Agnes Granville. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read law. He entered the Middle Temple in 1898, and was called to the bar in 1903.  Fortescue practised law in London until the outbreak of World War I, when he enlisted in the army as a second lieutenant in the Royal Scots Fusiliers. He was invalided out of the army with trench fever in 1915, and returned to his legal practice. In 1919 he married Joan Hutton-Lawson.  With the onset of World War II, Fortescue joined the Home Office as an assistant secretary. He resigned from this position in 1943 to become a professor of law at University College London; he remained at this post until his retirement in 1951. During his time at UCL, he also served as pro-vice-chancellor (1946–1951) and vice-president (1949–1951).  Fortescue wrote several books on law and jurisprudence; his most important work is probably The Law of Evidence (3rd ed., 1938). He also wrote biographies of his father-in-law, Sir Henry Hutton (1920

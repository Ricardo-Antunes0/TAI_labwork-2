Miranda Jane Richardson (born 3 March 1958) is an English actress. After some minor roles in the late 1970s, she achieved critical success for her role asplain-spoken, unpretentious secretary Diane Lockhart in the British comedy-drama series "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" (1998–2002). She has since appeared in a variety of films, most notably "American Beauty" (1999), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and "The Phantom of the Opera" (2004), for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. Richardson was also nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Miniseries or a Television Film for her role as Lady Macbeth in the BBC TV drama film "Macbeth" (2010). In 2011, she received an Honorary César Award from the Académie française.

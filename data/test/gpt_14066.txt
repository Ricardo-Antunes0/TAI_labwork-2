James Camp Tappan (September 9, 1825 – January 25, 1886) was an American educator, philosopher, and abolitionist.  Born in Cornwall, New York, Tappan was the son of a Congregational minister. He attended Union College in Schenectady, New York, and graduated from Union in 1847. He then studied theology at the Andover Theological Seminary, but abandoned this pursuit to study philosophy and education at Harvard University. Tappan received his MA from Harvard in 1850 and his PhD in 1854.  After teaching at various colleges in the United States, Tappan accepted a position as professor of philosophy and mathematics at Amherst College in 1859. He remained at Amherst for the rest of his life, becoming president of the college in 1879. In addition to his work at Amherst, Tappan also served as a trustee of Wesleyan University and was president of the American Philosophical Society in 1883.  Tappan is best known for his work as an abolitionist. He was a member of the Massachusetts Antislavery Society and the National Anti-Slavery Convention. He also helped to organize the American Freedmen's Union League (1862–1865), which worked to provide education and employment for former slaves.  Tappan died in Amherst at the age of 65. He was buried in Amherst's Mount Auburn Cemetery.

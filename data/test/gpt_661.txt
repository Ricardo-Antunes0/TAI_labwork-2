The Schoenflies (or Sch√∂nflies) notation, named after the inventor and first user, is a system for denoting intervals in the chromatic scale.  The notation consists of the letters A, B, C, D, E, F#, G#, and A#. The distance between two notes is measured in semitones (1/2 step), and the notes are written above or below the corresponding interval name. For example, C#-D is written as CD. The intervals A-F# and G-A# are written as A-F and G-A, respectively.

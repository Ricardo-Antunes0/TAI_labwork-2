Bakerloo (previously The Bakerloo Blues Line) was an English heavy blues-rock trio, established by Staffordshire guitarist David "Clem" Clempson, Terry Poole and others in the late 1960s, at the high point of the influence of The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream. Although the group was prominent only for around a year (1968â€“9) and released only one album, it played an important part in the history of the genre, especially in view of its members' subsequent involvement with Colosseum, Humble Pie, May Blitz, Graham Bond, Vinegar Joe, Judas Priest and Uriah Heep. History The Bakerloo Blues Line was formed in February 1968 by David "Clem" Clempson and Terry Poole. The band was named after the London Underground's Bakerloo line, who worked with several drummers, including John "Poli" Palmer and John Hinch, before settling with Keith Baker. Under the management of Jim Simpson, they began performing regularly at Henry's Blueshouse in Birmingham and joined Simpson's UK 'Big Bear Ffolly' tour with Earth (the future Black Sabbath), Locomotive and Tea And Symphony. The group appeared as the support act for Led Zeppelin's debut at London's famed Marquee Club on 18 October 1968.

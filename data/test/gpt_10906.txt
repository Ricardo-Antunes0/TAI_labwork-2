Inference is a process of deriving logical conclusions from data. Soil inference systems are used to make judgements about the properties of soil from data that is collected in a field, laboratory or remotely. The properties that can be inferred from soil data include texture, mineralogy, organic matter, water content, and depth of soil.  Soil inference systems are used to make judgements about the properties of soil from data that is collected in a field, laboratory or remotely. The properties that can be inferred from soil data include texture, mineralogy, organic matter, water content, and depth of soil. Soil inference systems can be divided into two main categories: classical and numerical. Classical inference systems rely on empirical relationships between soil properties and use indicators such as grain size or moisture percentages to make inferences. Numerical inference systems use mathematical models to make predictions about soil properties.  Classical inference systems rely on empirical relationships between soil properties and use indicators such as grain size or moisture percentages to make inferences. Numerical inference systems use mathematical models to make predictions about soil properties. Soil texture is one of the most commonly inferred properties of soil. Texture can be determined using various measures such as grain size or surface area. Grain size is determined by how tightly the individual particles are packed together and can be used to estimate the particle size distribution (PSD), which is a measure of the fines and coarse fractions in the soil sample. Surface area is determined by the total area of the sample covered by pores that are

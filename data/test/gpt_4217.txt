Langues Générales d'Amérique du Sud (Spanish: Lenguas Generales de América del Sur) are a family of languages spoken in South America. They are part of the Amerindian language family.  The Langues Générales d'Amérique du Sud are subdivided into two branches: the Quechua branch and the Aymara branch.  The Quechua branch is spoken by the Quechua people, who inhabit the Andes Mountains of southern Peru, Ecuador, and northern Bolivia. It is the most widely spoken language in that region, and is also spoken by smaller populations in Chile, Argentina, and Brazil.  The Aymara branch is spoken by the Aymara people, who inhabit most of Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. It is the second most widely spoken language in that region, after Spanish.

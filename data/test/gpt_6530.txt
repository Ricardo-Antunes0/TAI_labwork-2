Bartholomew Lloyd (1772â€“1837) was an Irish mathematician who made significant contributions to the theory of equations.  Lloyd was born in 1772 in Co. Wexford, Ireland. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1796. He then studied mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, where he received his Master of Arts in 1801 and his Doctor of Philosophy in 1805.  Lloyd began his career as a teacher at Trinity College, Dublin, where he served as professor of mathematics from 1811 until his death in 1837. He is also credited with being the first person to use the term "partial differential equation".  Lloyd is best known for his work on the theory of equations, which included contributions to the theory of elliptic functions, the theory of partial differential equations, and the theory of integrals over curved domains. He is also known for his work on differential geometry and Fourier analysis.

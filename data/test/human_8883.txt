Fat Les was a British band consisting of Blur bassist Alex James, actor Keith Allen, and artist Damien Hirst. Vocals on their singles were provided by Keith Allen (all), Alex James ("Vindaloo"), Lily Allen ("Who Invented Fish & Chips?"), Andy Kane ("Who Invented Fish & Chips?"), Lisa Moorish ("Naughty Christmas (Goblin in the Office)") and various choirs ("Jerusalem"). Background James and Hirst first knew each other when they were students at Goldsmiths College, but became friendly when they and Allen met at the Groucho Club. In May 1998, while discussing the forthcoming FIFA World Cup, Allen and James had the idea of creating an unofficial World Cup song, and formed Fat Les (named after a woman they knew). They were later joined by Hirst when they asked him to create artwork for them. Fat Les created the unofficial England national football anthem "Vindaloo" with Guy Pratt and then brought in the singer Andy Kane. The song reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. In the music video, the three band members featured alongside Paul Kaye, Rowland Rivron, Ed Tudor-Pole, Matt Lucas and David Walliams, and appearances by Allen's children Lily and Alfie.

Peter Trippi is editor-in-chief of Fine Art Connoisseur, a bimonthly magazine for collectors of representational painting, sculpture, drawings and printsâ€”both historical and contemporary. From 2003 until 2006, Trippi was director of New York City's Dahesh Museum of Art, the only institution in the United States devoted to 19th- and early 20th-century European academic art. Most recently, Trippi co-curated (with Elizabeth Prettejohn and Ivo Blom) the major touring exhibition Lawrence Alma-Tadema: At Home in Antiquity.  Organized by the Fries Museum (Leeuwarden, Netherlands), this project premiered at that museum on 1 October 2016; it closed there on 7 February 2017 and moved to the Belvedere in Vienna, where it was seen from 24 February through 18 June 2017.  Its final venue was London's Leighton House Museum (7 July - 29 October 2017.)  Trippi co-edited the accompanying 250-page book (published by Prestel) with Prof. Prettejohn, and co-convened (with her and others) a symposium in London devoted to Alma-Tadema in October 2017 (Paul Mellon Centre and Birkbeck Institute of the Moving Image).

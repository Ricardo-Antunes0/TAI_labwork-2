Isotachophoresis (ITP) is a technique in analytical chemistry used for selective separation and concentration of ionic analytes. It is a form of electrophoresis; charged analytes are separated based on ionic mobility, a quantity which tells how fast an ion migrates through an electric field. Overview In conventional ITP separations, a discontinuous buffer system is used. The sample is introduced between a zone of fast leading electrolyte (LE) and a zone of slow terminating (or: trailing) electrolyte (TE). Usually, the LE and the TE have a common counterion, but the co-ions (having charges with the same sign as the analytes of interest) are different: the LE is defined by co-ions with high ionic mobility, while the TE is defined by co-ions with low ionic mobility. The analytes of interest have intermediate ionic mobility. Application of an electric potential results in a low electrical field in the leading electrolyte and a high electrical field in the terminating electrolyte. Analyte ions situated in the TE zone will migrate faster than the surrounding TE co-ions, while analyte ions situated in the LE will migrate slower; the result is that analytes are focused at the LE/TE interface.

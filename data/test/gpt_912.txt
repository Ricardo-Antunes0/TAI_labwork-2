Mindegade is a 120 meters long street in Aarhus, Denmark. It stretches from Søndergade in the west to Gammel Torv in the east and from Gammel Torv to Vejlbyparken in the south. The name "Mindegade" derives from a word meaning "minding path" or "path of minding".  The street runs through the heart of Aarhus' old town and has been a busy shopping street since the Middle Ages. It has been the scene of many public celebrations and events, including the coronation of King Christian IX in 1848 and the opening of Aarhus University in 1875. The Mindegade is today one of Aarhus' most popular tourist destinations, with many cafés, restaurants, bars and souvenir shops located along its length.

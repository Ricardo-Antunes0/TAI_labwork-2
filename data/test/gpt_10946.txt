Raymond Stephen Perdriau (3 December 188625 December 1974) was a Canadian-born French painter, sculptor, and writer.  Stephen Perdriau was born in Montreal, Quebec, the son of Marie-Therese (née Granger) and Raymond Perdriau, a cabinetmaker. He studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and then moved to Italy where he lived for many years. He established himself as a painter in Paris in the 1920s. He was associated with the Surrealist movement, and his paintings often depict dreamlike scenes or abstract figures. He also became well known for his sculptures, which are often elaborately carved and decorated with plants and animals. In the 1950s he moved to Italy again, and he died there in 1974.

The 1975 Zaliv Scandal was a political scandal in the Czechoslovakia of that year. It involved the resignation of Prime Minister Antonin Novotny, and the subsequent attempt of President Gustáv Husák to remove him from office.  The scandal began when it was revealed that Novotny had allegedly accepted a bribe from a Hungarian businessman, István Bicskei. The bribery had been arranged by Jan Masaryk, Novotny's predecessor as Prime Minister. Novotny resigned on 25 May 1975, and Husák unsuccessfully attempted to remove him from office. The scandal damaged Husák's reputation, and he was unable to win re-election in 1976.

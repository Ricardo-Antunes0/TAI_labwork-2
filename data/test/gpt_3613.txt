Pityrodia puberula is a flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia and is found growing in heath, woodland and shrubland.  The species is small, with leaves that are a light green in colour and a single flower head that is surrounded by green sepals and petals. The flowers are white, with a yellow centre and a purple base.   The plant is unusual in that it does not have roots at the base of the stem, instead it has stem-like roots that grow outwards from the stem. This makes the plant difficult to transplant, and it requires regular watering in order to survive.

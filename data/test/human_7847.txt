The Committee of Seventy is an independent, non-partisan advocate for better government in Philadelphia that works to achieve clean and effective government, better elections and informed and engaged citizens. Founded in 1904, it is a nonprofit organization guided by a board of directors made up of some of the region's most respected business, legal and civic leaders. They have an app focused around their WeVote initiative. They also sponsor an anti-gerrymandering initiative called Draw the Lines PA. History Committee of Seventy was established in 1904 for the express purpose of improving the voting process, bringing people of competence and integrity into government, combating corruption, and informing and engaging citizens in the critical affairs of the day.  The organization played a major role in the adoption of civil service reforms and the passage of the 1919 and 1951 Home Rule Charters. Towards mid-century, Seventy expanded its focus to working on public policy and civic education by undertaking research projects to identify problems in the city and propose solutions, and conducting outreach to educate Philadelphians on local government.

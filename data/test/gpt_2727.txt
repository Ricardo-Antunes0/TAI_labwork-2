Shareholder rebellion occurs when the owners of a corporation or other enterprise rebel against the management of the organization, typically by withholding their votes or dividends.  The term shareholder rebellion generally refers to a situation in which a majority of shareholders in a company withhold their votes or dividends from the company in protest against the management, often because they disagree with the strategic direction of the company or believe that management is not acting in the best interests of shareholders. This can lead to a change in management and/or a decline in stock prices.  There are a number of reasons why shareholders may rebel against management. A common reason is when shareholders believe that management is not implementing strategies that are in the best interests of shareholders, such as when a company makes poor financial decisions. Shareholder rebellions also occur when companies are facing external pressures, such as when competitors are expanding into a particular market segment and shareholders believe that management is not taking appropriate steps to protect shareholder value.  Shareholder rebellions can also occur for other reasons, such as when shareholders believe that the company's board of directors is not acting in an effective manner. In some cases, shareholder rebellions can lead to changes in corporate governance, such as when companies adopt more shareholder-friendly policies or appoint independent directors.

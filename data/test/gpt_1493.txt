The Cuban Missile Crisis, also known as the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, was a confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union over the placement of nuclear-armed missiles on the island of Cuba. The crisis began on October 16, 1962, when U.S. officials learned that the Soviet Union had installed nuclear missiles in Cuba. It ended on November 24, 1962, when the United States and the Soviet Union signed the Agreement to Remove Missiles from Cuba.

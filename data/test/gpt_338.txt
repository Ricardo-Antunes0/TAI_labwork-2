The Sufan movement (; "Campaign to Eradicate Violence") is a Pakistani social justice movement started in 2006 to fight violence against women. The movement is led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai.  The Sufan movement was founded by Malala Yousafzai in 2006, after she was shot by the Taliban for speaking out against the Taliban's campaign of violence against women. Yousafzai called on women and girls to stand up against violence and take action to end gender-based discrimination.  The Sufan movement has worked to promote gender equality and the rights of women and girls in Pakistan. The group has organized protests and campaigns against violence against women, launched public service announcements, and created educational materials to raise awareness about the issue.  The Sufan movement has also partnered with international organizations to fight violence against women. In 2013, the group partnered with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) to launch the "Equality for All" campaign. The campaign seeks to end all forms of violence against women and promote gender equality in Pakistan.  The Sufan movement is an important effort to end violence against women in Pakistan.

Bolokhov  was a city mentioned in the Kyivan and Galicianâ€“Volhynian chronicles, which gave the name to the Bolokhovian Land, but that has not yet been found or identified. The currently known chronicle texts, like other historical sources, do not allow to determine the location of the city of Bolokhov with acceptable, sufficient archaeological accuracy. M. Dimnik claims that this land may have been located in the southwest corner of the Principality of Kyiv and that it also shared borders with Volhynia and Galicia. Mentions in chronicles  According to historians, Bolokhov was located in the upper reaches of the Southern Bug, in the basins of the Horyn River with the Sluch tributary and the Teteriv River. This follows the mention of it in the Galician-Volhynian Chronicle of the 13th century. The very first mention is associated with the year 1150, when Volodymyrko Volodarovych, prince of Galicia, went from Galicia to Kyiv through Bolokhov. The second reference dates back to 1170, when Mstislav II, through Bolokhov, fled from Kyiv to Volodymyr-Volynskyi. The third reference is in 1231, the fourth, about the attack of Daniel of Galicia, in 1241, and finally the last in 1257. The Bolokhovs were allied with Rostislav Mikhailovich and they saw action when the latter besieged Bakota. An account described the capture of the princes of Bolokhov by Volodymyrko after the attack on Daniel's lands.

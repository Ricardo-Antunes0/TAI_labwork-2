Warner Mifflin (August 21, 1745 â€“ October 3, 1817) was an American publishing company founded in 1785 by Aaron Burr and his cousin Jonathan Mifflin. It was the first successful U.S. paper mill, and during the 19th century it became one of the country's leading publishers.  The company became well known for its textbooks, including "The United States Constitution" (1837) and "The Dictionary of American Biography" (1885). In 1876, it merged with the Philadelphia publishing company George W. Childs and Company to form the Warner-Childs-George W. Company. After the death of George W. Childs in 1907, the company was renamed Warner Bros.-Seven Arts Company. In 1935, it merged with Time, Inc., and in 1986 it was acquired by The Walt Disney Company.  Warner Mifflin traces its roots to 1785, when Aaron Burr and his cousin Jonathan Mifflin established a paper mill in Philadelphia. The mill produced paper for the burgeoning printer industry in America.

St Joseph's/OCB (Irish: Naomh Seosamh, BUC) are an amateur athletic club located in the North Inner city of Dublin, Ireland.  They are the last remaining Gaelic Athletic Association club in the area. The club is an amalgamation of two clubs: St Joseph's of East Wall and O’Connell Boys of North Wall. St Joseph's were founded in 1918 and rose to prominence, especially in the 1920s and 1930s, albeit with intermittent objections; St Joseph's also produced a continuing stream of inter-county players. O’Connell Boys were established in 1964, as a club for the former members of the O’Connell Boys Youth Club in Seville Place, Dublin. However, changes to the inner city in the latter half of the 20th century – population decline, unemployment, and school closings – caused a corresponding decline in membership for both clubs. At the end of 1989, the two clubs merged into St Joseph's/OCB and have played as such since the 1990 season.

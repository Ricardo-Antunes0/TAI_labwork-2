The Widows' Almshouses, also known as the Almshouses of Nantwich, are a group of ten almshouses in the town of Nantwich, Cheshire, England. The buildings are Grade II* listed.  The almshouses were founded in 1577 by the townspeople of Nantwich as a place for women who had been widowed to live together in peace and comfort. At first they were located in a converted Franciscan friary on Town Moor, but in 1892 they were moved to their present site on Church Street. The original buildings were designed by architect Thomas Harrison and are constructed of local sandstone. In 1987 the almshouses were refurbished and enlarged, and today they accommodate eighty-six residents.  The Widows' Almshouses are open to the public throughout the year.

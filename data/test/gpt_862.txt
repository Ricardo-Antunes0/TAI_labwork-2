The Gyumri massacre was a mass murder that took place in the Armenian city of Gyumri on April 22, 1992. The event is considered to be one of the worst massacres in the history of the Armenian people.  The Gyumri massacre was a result of Operation Desert Storm, a military conflict between Iraq and coalition forces that lasted from January 17, 1991 to November 8, 1991. The massacre was committed by the Azeri military forces, which were ordered to quell pro-independence demonstrations in Gyumri. Up to 1500 people were killed and thousands more were wounded.

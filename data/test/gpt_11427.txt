The Siege of Varberg was a Danish military campaign fought from 15 May to 21 July 1676, during the Third Northern War. The Danish rebels under Christian V, who had been expelled from Sweden, besieged the town of Varberg in southern Sweden. After a long siege, the Danes were successful in taking the town and massacring the Swedish garrison.

Helmut Andreas Paul Grieshaber or HAP Grieshaber (15 February 1909 â€“ 12 May 1981) was a German artist. His preferred medium was large format woodcuts. Biography Grieshaber was born in Rot an der Rot. He went to school in Nagold and later in Reutlingen. From the age of 17 he was apprenticed to the printing trade in Reutlingen. While here, from 1926 to 1928, he studied art in nearby Stuttgart. He then travelled extensively to Paris, London, Egypt, Arabia and Greece. At the beginning of the Nazi regime, from 1933 until 1940, Grieshaber was banned from his profession. During that time he scratched out a living as an untrained labourer in the town of Reutlingen. He spent the war years unwillingly in the German army and, as a prisoner of war, doing forced labour in Belgian mines. After the war he returned to Germany, living in a small cottage on the Achalm, and concentrated on doing large-scale woodcuts and posters. From 1951 to 1953 he taught at the Bernsteinschule school of art. Between 1955 and 1960 he taught at the Kunstakademie (Academy of Fine Arts) in Karlsruhe as successor to Erich Heckel.

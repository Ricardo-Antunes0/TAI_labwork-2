Verbal overshadowing is a phenomenon where giving a person a lot of verbal feedback (verbal praise, verbal criticism, verbal instruction, etc.) can override or compete with other forms of feedback (visual feedback, nonverbal feedback, etc.) and cause the person to perform worse in a task than if they had received only nonverbal or visual feedback.  Verbal overshadowing can occur in any type of task where there is a competition between different types of feedback. For example, in a math test, verbal feedback might be given about how well the student answered the questions, while nonverbal feedback might be given about their posture or hand movements.  The effects of verbal overshadowing can be negative. For example, a student who receives lots of verbal feedback on their math performance may feel overwhelmed and stressed. This could lead to difficulty concentrating on the task at hand and could also lead to mistakes.  The effects of verbal overshadowing can also be positive. For example, a student who receives lots of verbal feedback on their math performance may learn more about the subject matter than they would if they only received nonverbal or visual feedback.

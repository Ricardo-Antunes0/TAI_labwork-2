The Oxford Placement Test (OPT) is an entrance examination for undergraduate programmes at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.  The OPT was developed in the early 20th century and is one of the oldest and most prestigious university entrance examinations in the world. The test is administered by the University of Oxford's Examinations Board, and is composed of three parts: an English language examination, a mathematics examination, and a science examination.  The OPT has been criticised for its difficulty, with applicants required to achieve grades equivalent to A-level results in order to be eligible to take it. However, the test is also seen as a valuable indicator of academic potential and is often associated with prestigious universities.

Arguably: Essays is a 2011 book by American philosopher and public intellectual John Searle. The book collects a series of essays written between 1990 and 2010, on topics such as language, mind, and reality.  The book has been well received by reviewers. Reviewing the book in "The New York Times", critic Dwight Garner called Searle "a polymathic thinker of rare intelligence and wide-ranging curiosity", and said the essays in Arguably "offer an eloquent, lucid, provocative exploration of some of the deepest questions about human existence." Reviewing the book in "The Guardian", journalist Ian Buruma called it "a tour de force of philosophical thinking" and recommended it to readers interested in philosophy, cognitive science, and general intellectual discussion.

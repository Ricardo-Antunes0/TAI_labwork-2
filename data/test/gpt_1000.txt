The term Middle English literature refers to the body of written works produced in the English language between the late 12th and the early 15th centuries. In its broadest sense, Middle English literature includes works written in all of the dialects spoken in England during that time period, including Anglo-Norman, Early Modern English, and Scots. However, since this is a highly subjective term, it is often used more restrictively to refer to works written in the dialects of northern England and southern Scotland during the 12th and 13th centuries.  Middle English literature was dominated by religious texts, including the Bible, which was translated into Middle English around 1140. The popularity of these texts led to the development of Middle English prose, which was characterized by its dense and repetitive syntax and its use of alliteration. Other important authors during this period include Geoffrey Chaucer, William Langland, and Thomas Malory. Middle English literature began to decline around 1450, when new literary genres such as the Tudor novel began to take hold.

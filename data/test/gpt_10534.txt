Frank Serrao (August 10, 1918 â€“ May 7, 1984) was an American sculptor.  Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, Serrao studied at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Academie Julian in Paris. He was a member of the sculptors' group known as the Black Mountain School. Serrao is best known for his large-scale public sculpture, which often incorporates elements of movement. His most famous works are The Gates of Hell (1965), a pair of doors that open and close to create a sense of movement and energy in front of Philadelphia's City Hall, and The Angel of the North (1982), a large metal sculpture that dominates the skyline of Newcastle upon Tyne, North England.  Serrao died in 1984 in New York City.

The Skara Missal is a 12th-century illuminated manuscript Gospel book. It is the earliest surviving example of a major European manuscript from the 12th century, and one of the earliest surviving examples of the Gothic style of art.  The Skara Missal was created in Norway in about 1150, and is one of the few illuminated manuscripts from the Middle Ages that survives in its entirety. The manuscript is named after the town of Skara in Sk√•ne County, Sweden, where it was discovered in 1852. The Skara Missal is now located in the National Library of Sweden.  The Skara Missal is a lavishly illustrated manuscript, with approximately 700 full-page illustrations and some 1,500 smaller illustrations. Its most striking feature is its extensive use of gold leaf, which gives the book a rich, golden appearance. The majority of the illustrations are religious scenes, including depictions of Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary. Some of the other notable features of the Skara Missal include its innovative use of perspective and its elaborate border decorations.

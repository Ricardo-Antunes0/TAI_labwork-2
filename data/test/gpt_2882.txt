Ju Zheng (; November 8, 1876 – May 12, 1962) was a Chinese mathematician who made significant contributions to the theory of functionals and the calculus of variations.  Ju Zheng was born in what is now Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, in 1876. He studied at the University of Hong Kong from 1895 to 1899, where he was influenced by the German mathematician Karl Weierstrass. From 1899 to 1902 he studied at the University of Göttingen, where he worked with Max Planck and Alfred Wegener. In 1902 he returned to China, where he served as professor at Peking University from 1907 to 1932.   Ju Zheng is best known for his work on functionals and the calculus of variations, which culminated in his book "The Calculus of Variations" (1924). He also developed a theory of manifolds, and contributed to differential geometry. Ju Zheng died in 1962.

Sonorism (Polish: Sonoryzm) is an approach to music composition that emphasizes the use of sound as a primary compositional element. Sonorism is also the name given to a style of music that developed in Poland in the early 20th century and was characterized by its use of harmonic clusters, repetitive rhythms, and heavy use of dissonance.  The origins of Polish sonorism can be traced back to the late 19th century, when Polish composers began to experiment with new harmonic and rhythmic techniques. In the early 20th century, sonorism developed into a distinct style in Poland, characterized by its heavy use of dissonance and harmonic clusters. The style became popular in Poland during the 1920s and 1930s, and many of the leading figures in Polish sonorism were composers such as Witold Lutoslawski, Krzysztof Penderecki, and Zbigniew Preisner. After World War II, sonorism faded from popularity in Poland, but it has continued to be influential in Polish music circles.

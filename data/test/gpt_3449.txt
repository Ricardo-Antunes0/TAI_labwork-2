The Vale of Pickering is a low-lying area of Yorkshire, England. It is bounded to the north by the River Ure and to the east by the River Aire. The Vale is bordered by the Hambleton Hills in the west and the North York Moors in the east. The Pickering Nuclear Power Plant is located in the Vale.  The Vale of Pickering was part of the ancient Kingdom of Northumbria. After the Norman Conquest, it became part of the Honour of Richmond and then, in 1296, it was granted to Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk. The Duke granted land to settlements in perpetuity, including Pickering, which became a borough. In 1336, Pickering Castle was built on a motte and bailey castle on land granted by the Duke.  Pickering was largely agricultural until the early 19th century when coal mining began to take place. The Vale became a heavily industrialized area during World War II, with factories such as Singer and BAE Systems being located there. Today, most of the industry has moved out of the Vale and it is now primarily a residential area.

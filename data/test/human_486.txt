Haberbusch i Schiele was a (now defunct) Warsaw-based brewery holding created in 1846. By the end of 19th century, the company had grown to become the largest beer producer in Warsaw and one of the largest in Poland. Destroyed in the Warsaw Uprising during World War II, the brewery was then nationalized by the communist authorities of Poland and partially rebuilt for the Browary Warszawskie company. History  By mid-19th century beer-making in the Kingdom of Poland was neglected due to high excise taxes imposed by the Russian authorities. However, new technologies were being introduced and the industry was seen as a possible source of profit. In 1846 two Warsaw beer makers, Błażej Haberbusch and Konstanty Schiele created a company with their common father-in-law Henryk Klawe. The new Haberbusch, Schiele i Klawe partnership soon bought a bankrupt Schöffer i Glimpf brewery in central Warsaw from the Polish Bank. With Klawe's money the Haberbusch and Schiele managed to put the business back on track and in 1850 they acquired yet another brewery from a Mr. Czarnecki. The two companies were merged.

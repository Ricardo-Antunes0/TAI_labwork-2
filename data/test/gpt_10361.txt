Normorphine is an opiate analogue, the N-demethylated derivative of morphine, that has been extensively used as an analgesic and antitussive agent. Normorphine is also used as a deterrent to drug abuse.  Normorphine was first synthesized in 1874 by C.R.A. Schafer and S.R. Wesson. It was first used medically in 1895 to provide relief from pain due to surgery. Normorphine is still in use today, primarily as an analgesic and antitussive agent. Normorphine is also used as a deterrent to drug abuse.

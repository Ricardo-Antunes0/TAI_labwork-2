The Tornillo tent city was a temporary encampment in Tornillo, Texas, United States, made of tents and tarps erected by the U.S. Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in order to house families who were caught crossing the United States' southern border without proper documentation.   The encampment was first reported in early June 2018 and was later closed down in late July 2018. The tent city was the largest such operation carried out by ICE since the Trump administration took office.   The encampment caused a public backlash, with some local residents protesting and calling for its closure, while others expressed support for the government's efforts to enforce the nation's immigration laws.

Farris Hassan (born July 30, 1989) is an American who at 16 years old, while a junior at Pine Crest School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, took an unaccompanied trip to Iraq. He said he was inspired by a personal attachment to the situation in Iraq and an English class having a project on "immersion journalism".  Global news outlets reported that Hassan left home for Iraq without telling his parents. Hassan's parents, now divorced, are Iraqi-born but immigrated to the United States, where they have lived for 35 years. Journey to Iraq  Hassan set off on December 11, 2005 flying from Miami International Airport to Kuwait City, arriving on December 13 at 12:05 a.m, and stopping in Amsterdam on December 12. In Kuwait he first called his parents telling them that he wanted to travel to Baghdad. Failing to cross the Iraqi border by taxi, he then flew to Beirut, Lebanon, where he stayed with friends of the family and interviewed a media relations officer of Hezbollah. On December 25, he took a plane to Baghdad International Airport. He then interviewed Iraqis and American soldiers about the situation in Iraq and looked for a humanitarian organization where he could do volunteer work. On December 28, he was picked up by the 101st Airborne Division. The U.S. embassy then issued a statement on December 30, stating that Hassan had departed Baghdad, and was safely on board a return flight back to the United States.

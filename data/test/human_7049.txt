Sandhedens hævn – En marionetkomedie (The Revenge of Truth: A Marionette Comedy) is a play by the Danish author Karen Blixen which was first published in the Danish literary journal Tilskueren in 1926. As a child, Blixen wrote a number of plays which she performed with her sisters and friends. Two of these, Rolf Blåskægs død (Rolf Blåskæg's Death) and Marsk Stig were published in Blixeniana in 1983 but Sandhedens hævn was the only one to be performed in Blixen's lifetime when it was presented at the Royal Danish Theatre in 1936. It was later performed on stage in 1974 at the Boldhus Theatre and with puppets in 1977 at the Riddersalen Theatre. In 1986, Ib Nørholm adapted the play as an opera which was presented at the Østre Gasværk Theatre in 1986 as well as in Odense and Aarhus. In 1998, it was presented at Folketeatret with a combination of actors and puppets. It was also staged in connection with the anniversary celebrations at the Royal Theatre in 1998–99.

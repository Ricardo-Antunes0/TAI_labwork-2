East London is a popularly and informally defined area in London, England, which includes the former Docklands area and the Tower Hamlets district. The boundaries of the East End are not officially defined, but they generally include the areas around Whitechapel, Stepney, Bethnal Green, Bow and Stratford.   East London was once the most densely populated part of London. Its population peaked at 1.5 million in the 1920s but has since declined dramatically, with its 2011 population estimate standing at just over 500,000. Despite this decline, East London retains a strong cultural identity and is home to a large number of significant tourist attractions, such as the Bangladeshi community's Brick Lane Market and the Portuguese community's Aldgate market.

Gliese 1214 is a dim M4.5 red dwarf in the constellation Ophiuchus with an apparent magnitude of 14.7. It is located at a distance of approximately 47 light years from Earth. The star is about one-fifth the radius of the Sun with a surface temperature estimated to be . Its luminosity is only 0.33% that of the Sun. The estimate for the stellar radius is 15% larger than predicted by theoretical models. It also shows a 1% intrinsic variability in the near-infrared probably caused by stellar spots. The star is rotating slowly, with a period that is most likely an integer multiple of 53Â days. It is probably at least three billion years old and a member of the old thin disk of the Milky Way. Although GJ 1214 has a low to moderate level of magnetic activity, it does undergo flares and is a source of X-ray emission with a base luminosity of . The temperature of the stellar corona is estimated to be about .

Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical compound and one of the simplest and best known bisphenols. It is produced by the condensation of phenol and acetone, with an estimated 4 million tonnes of produced worldwide in 2015. It is a colourless solid which is soluble in organic solvents, but poorly soluble in water (0.344 wt % at 83 °C). BPA and its derivatives have many uses, most of which are centred around plastics. Its largest single application is as a co-monomer in the production of polycarbonates and, to a much lesser extent, polysulfones. Its epoxide derivative BADGE (also called DGEBA) is the starting material for most epoxy resins. Low levels of unpolymerised BPA and BADGE are also used in PVC plastisols,  as an auxiliary antioxidant and  acid scavenger respectively. A common, if minor, use is as a stabiliser in thermal paper. It is not a plasticizer, although it is often wrongly labelled as such.

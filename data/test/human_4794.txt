Feeder cattle, in some countries or regions called store cattle, are young cattle mature enough either to undergo backgrounding or to be fattened in preparation for slaughter. They may be steers (castrated males) or heifers (females who have not dropped a calf). The term often implicitly reflects an intent to sell to other owners for fattening (finishing). Backgrounding occurs at backgrounding operations, and fattening occurs at a feedlot. Feeder calves are less than 1 year old; feeder yearlings are between 1 and 2 years old. Both types are often produced in a cow-calf operation. After attaining a desirable weight, feeder cattle become finished cattle that are sold to a packer (finished cattle are also called fattened cattle, fat cattle, fed cattle, or, when contrasted with carcasses, live cattle). Packers slaughter the cattle and sell the meat in carcass boxed form. Feedlots producing live cattle for slaughter will typically purchase 500-850 pound feeder cattle calves and feed to grow the animals into 850-1400 pound cattle. Backgrounding operations will typically purchase 300-600 pound feeder cattle calves and feed to grow the animals into 650-875 pound backgrounded cattle. Backgrounding cattle that achieve weights of 650-700 pounds are suitable for sale to grass feeding operations, whereas those achieving weights of 800-825 pounds are suitable for sale to feedlot operators. Buyers of feeder cattle tend to look for high average gain (in weight) and low feed-to-gain ratio. Depending on circumstances, different feeder cattle buyers will look for different ranges of animal weight and grade.

Dan Clifton (1865â€“1896?), known as Dynamite Dan, was an American criminal, notorious for his exploits as a bank robber.  Dan Clifton was born in 1865 in Ohio. As a young man, he became involved in crime, and by the 1890s he had become one of the most notorious bandits in America, robbing banks all over the country. In 1896, Clifton and his gang were finally arrested after a successful robbery of a bank in Joliet, Illinois. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, but died soon after his arrest from tuberculosis.

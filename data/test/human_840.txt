Michel Léveillé is a Canadian ice hockey coach and former center who was a two-time All-American for Maine. Career Léveillé was a late-blooming junior player, not participating in a high-level league until he was 19. In his final season of junior eligibility, Léveillé's point total exploded and he averaged more than two points per game with the Nanaimo Clippers. Léveillé was forced to play senior hockey for a year before he could join the ice hockey team at Maine, but his freshman year was well worth the wait. He was nearly a point-per-game player for the year and was named the Hockey East Rookie of the Year. He helped the team finish second in the conference and than capture the Hockey East Championship. Maine received the #3 overall seed and marched through the NCAA Tournament. Léveillé's only goal was an important one as it tied a game late and allowed the Black Bears to overcome an early deficit to Harvard. The team reached the championship game for the 5th time in program history, but the offense failed and they fell 0–1 to Denver.

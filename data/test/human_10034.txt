Lauterecken-Grumbach station is the station of the town of Lauterecken in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. It is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 6 station and has two platform tracks. The station is located in the network area of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (Rhine-Neckar Transport Association, VRN) and it is in fare zone 793. Its address is Bahnhofstraße 1. The station's name reflects the fact that the station also originally served Grumbach, which is a few kilometres away. It was opened on 1 May 1904 as a junction station on the Glan Valley Railway (Glantalbahn), which was completed on the same day over its full-length from Homburg to Bad Münster, and the Lauter Valley Railway, which starts in Kaiserslautern and was opened in 1883. The Glan Valley Railway was shut down gradually around Lauterecken from the mid-1980s, and since then the station has only been the terminus of the Lauter Valley Railway. Since 2000, it has been a station on the draisine operation on the former Glan Valley Railway between Altenglan and Staudernheim.

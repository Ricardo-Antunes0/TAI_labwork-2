Keep-it Technologies (formerly TimeTemp) is a spin-off technology company from The Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) in Ås, just outside Oslo in Norway. Keep-it Technologies has offices and manufacturing facilities at Furuset in Oslo. The company is primarily engaged in research and technology development of a shelf-life indicator for temperature-sensitive products, such as food, pharmaceuticals and chemicals. The company’s research efforts have received financial support from the Research Council of Norway’s Food Programme, as well as from Innovation Norway’s industrial R&D scheme (IFU). The business  Keep-it Technologies has developed a time and temperature indicator (TTI) that shows the actual remaining shelf life of products, which is significantly better than the traditional static date stamp. It is based on temperature over time, and each indicator is tailored to the products shelf life profile.  The technology behind the indicator has been developed and verified at the University, before a working prototype was finally developed. Keep-it Technologies has patented the indicator in a number of countries, including the USA.

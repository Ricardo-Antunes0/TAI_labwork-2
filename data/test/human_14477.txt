Also known as a "perfume lamp", "effusion lamp," or "catalytic lamp", a fragrance lamp is a lamp that disperses scented alcohol using a catalytic combustion wick consisting of a cotton wick threaded through a natural, porous stone. The catalytic combustion wick was developed and patented by Maurice Berger, a French pharmaceutical dispenser, in 1898 as a means of purifying the air in hospitals and mortuaries.  It is claimed that this catalytic oxidation process destroys bacteria in the air and increases oxygen levels. The fragrance lamp's process is initiated by igniting the stone burner seated at the mouth of the lamp. After two minutes the flame is extinguished by blowing it out. The heated burner remains active as the flame-less catalytic combustion process and diffuses the combusted alcohol and any added aromatics throughout the room. The lamp does not operate with an open flame, making it much safer to operate than scented candles. Its lower operating temperature also means that, unlike scented candles, the aromatics are diffused very efficiently into the ambient air without being burned.

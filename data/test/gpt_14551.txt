Harbour (1979â€“1985) was a French Thoroughbred racehorse.  Harbour was a gray horse with a white muzzle and chest, bred in France by his owner, the wealthy industrialist Jacques Chirac. He was sired by the French Triple Crown winner Saint-Albin and his dam, Harbour Maid, was a daughter of the American broodmare Harbour Town.  As a two-year-old, Harbour won two of his four races including the Prix du Jockey Club and the Prix Maurice de Gheest. In 1980 he finished second in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and third in the Epsom Derby. He failed to win in 1981 but finished second in both the Prix du Moulin and the Grand Criterium du Saint-Cloud.  Retired to stud at Chantilly Racecourse, Harbour sired several successful horses including Sadler's Wells (Irish Derby), Haras du Quesnay (Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe), and Sacred Hill (Prix Ganay). He died in 1985 at the age of twenty-four.

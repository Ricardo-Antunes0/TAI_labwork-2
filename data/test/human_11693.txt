The Women's Indian Association (WIA) was founded at Adayar, Madras, in 1917 by Annie Besant, Margaret Cousins, Jeena Raja Dasa, and others to liberate women from the deplorable condition women suffered in socio-economic and political matters during the 19th and the early 20th century. The Association later developed into a potent force to fight against illiteracy, child marriage, the Devadasi system and other, social ills. After Ms. Besant's death in 1933 Ms. Jinarajadasa became more involved in the internal politics of theosophists. Unfortunately the faction she supported fell from favour, and her name stopped appearing in all documents from that point onward. History The name of the organization was chosen to indicate its inclusive makeup, allowing both Indian and European women to join, and lack of affiliation to any philosophy, religion, caste, or social class. Founded on 8 May 1917, in Adyar, Madras by Margaret E. Cousins, its first president was Annie Besant. Founding members included S. Ambujammal, Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay, Mary Poonen Lukose, Begam Hasrat Mohani, Saralabai Naik, Dhanvanthi Rama Rau, Muthulakshmi Reddy, Mangalammal Sadasivier, and Herabai Tata.

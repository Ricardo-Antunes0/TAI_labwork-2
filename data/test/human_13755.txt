The AEZ railcar is a self-propelled, electric, multiple-unit train used by the state railway of Chile, Empresa de los Ferrocarriles del Estado (EFE). The railcars were used to service the electrified sections of line between Santiago, Valparaiso, Chillán, and Concepción, as well as used occasionally to service Temuco and Osorno. Six units were built and were numbered AEZ-41 to AEZ-46. Routes and services  The units were built and introduced into service in 1973 and are now over 45 years old. When they were introduced, electrification only reached Laja and the units were hauled by a diesel locomotive to electrified sections such as Temuco. A generator car was attached to operate interior lights and air conditioning. The AEZ units were popular among passengers due their speed and comfort. Because of their Japanese origin, they became known as the Japanese Train. They were often assigned to the Santiago–Chillán day service (398 km) which took five hours until they were replaced by the second hand Spanish UTS-444 electric units in 2002. The AEZ railcars were often used on the Santiago–Talcahuano service (Automotive to Talcahuano) from 1994 until the suspension of this service in 2007. The AEZ railcars were used on the Santiago–Talca route and on infrequent runs to Osorno and Temuco. Due to the 2010 earthquake, electrification was cut back to Chillán, isolating the section from Laja to Talcahuano. If the AEZ units were to run beyond Chillán, they would require a diesel locomotive once more. Repairs to the electrified rails have not been completed and, because there is little use of the line by electric trains south of Laja, will not likely be repaired in future.

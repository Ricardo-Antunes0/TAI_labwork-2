Forgiven is the fourth single from Christian rock band Skillet's 2009 album Awake, and is the ninth track on the album. The single was released to Christian CHR/Rock radio on August 2, 2010. The song received critical acclaim and was a moderate success. Although it reached number one on both Christian rock radio and CHR, Skillet has never performed it live. Meaning Lead Singer John Cooper said this about the song. 'I am really excited about this song, which is probably the most overtly Christian song on the album. I think “Forgiven” is a very hopeful song, and even though it's not the first time a song has been written on the subject, it strikes a balance between being very worship oriented and honest as well. This is a song about letting yourself or someone else down, but finding the power to not beat yourself up over it and to find closure with the person you hurt.'

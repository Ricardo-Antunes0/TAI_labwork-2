In 1659, he married Maria Mouzakiotou, with whom he had six children.  In 1660, Konstantinos Tzanes moved to Rome, where he quickly became one of the most important painters of the Mannerist period. He was influenced by the work of Caravaggio and Pietro da Cortona, as well as by the French style of Nicolas Poussin. In Rome, he also met Athanasius Kircher, who was to have a significant impact on his career.  In 1664, Konstantinos Tzanes returned to Constantinople, where he continued to paint until his death in 1685. His style is characterized by its naturalistic detail and intense emotionality. He is considered one of the most important painters of the Mannerist period and one of the most influential painters in European art history.

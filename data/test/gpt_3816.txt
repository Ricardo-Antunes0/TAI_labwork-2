In film and video, a cutaway is a visual interruption of the continuity of a scene, typically for the purpose of showing some aspect of the external environment or character.   The term can be traced back to the early days of motion pictures, when filmmakers would use cuts to give audiences a view of what was happening outside the frame. Today, cutaways occur frequently in television and film productions as well as video games. They are also used in advertising and as a way to introduce new scenes or characters.

, sometimes referred to as harakiri (, "to cut" or "to sever"), is a form of suicide by disembowelment or decapitation. It is distinguished from other forms of suicide by its intent, which is to die with honor rather than escape from life.  The practice of seppuku originated in the 16th century as a way for samurai to commit suicide rather than be captured by their enemies. It was later used by officers as a form of execution for criminal offences, and by commoners as a form of self-defence. Today, seppuku is considered an act of honourable suicide.  Disembowelment with a sword results in the most severe injuries because the intestines and other internal organs are cut open directly from the bellybutton to the rectum. Decapitation with a sword results in death from loss of blood and oxygen to the brain due to obstruction of the neck arteries.

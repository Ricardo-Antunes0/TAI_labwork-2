Giovanni Bernardino Azzolini (c. 1572 â€“ 12 July 1632) was an Italian composer and musician. He was the illegitimate son of the composer Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina.  Azzolini was born in Palestrina, perhaps around 1572. He was the illegitimate son of the composer Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, and may have been raised by his father's mistress, Anna Magdalena Countess of Pescara. Azzolini is best known for his sacred music, but he also wrote secular music and poetry. He died in Rome in 1632.

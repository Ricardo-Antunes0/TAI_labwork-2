The four-day Sino-Soviet Summit was held in Beijing from 14 to 16 September 1989. The Summit, which was the first meeting of the two Communist states in over a decade, was attended by the leaders of the Soviet Union and China, Mikhail Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping. The summit was intended to improve relations between the two countries, which had been strained by the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan and China's support for that invasion.  The Summit resulted in a number of agreements, including an agreement to end the war in Afghanistan and a declaration that both countries would respect each other's sovereignty. The Summit also led to the establishment of the Forum for International Cooperation between the Soviet Union and China, an organization that has met every year since its creation.

Justus Friedrich Karl Hecker (5 January 1795, in Marburg – 10 January 1874, in Frankfurt) was a German mathematician, physicist, and astronomer.  Hecker was born in Marburg, the son of Justus Hecker, a physician. He studied at the universities of Göttingen and Jena, where he received his doctorate in 1819 with a thesis on the theory of elasticity. Hecker then became an assistant at the University of Göttingen under Karl Friedrich Gauss. In 1827 he became a professor at the University of Frankfurt.  Hecker is known for his work on differential geometry, including his development of the Hecker–Phelps theory and the Hecker–Weber theorem. He also worked in astronomy, developing methods for calculating the positions of stars and planets. He died in Frankfurt.  Justus Friedrich Karl Hecker was born on January 5th 1795 in Marburg, Germany to Justus Hecker, a physician. After completing his undergraduate studies at Göttingen and later Jena Universities, Hecker took up an assistantship with Karl Friedrich Gauss at Göttingen in 1819. In 1827 he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University of Frankfurt am Main where he remained until his death on January 10th 1874. Much of his notable work is in differential geometry with significant contributions to the theory of elasticity as well as developing methods for calculating stellar and planetary positions. Additionally, Hecker made significant advances in astronomy including

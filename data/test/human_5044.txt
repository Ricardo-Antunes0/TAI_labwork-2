Lucky Feller is a British television sitcom written by Terence Frisby and produced by Humphrey Barclay. It was broadcast on ITV in 1976. The series stars David Jason and ran for one series of 13 episodes. The series is about two plumber brothers who live in Brockley, South East London. The basic set-up can be compared to Only Fools and Horses, except with David Jason playing the Rodney part, Bernard 'Shorty' Mepstead. The elder brother, Randolph 'Randy' Mepstead, is played by Peter Armitage (Nicky Henson in the pilot episode). Shorty is naive, hopeful and in love with a girl named Kathleen Peake (Cheryl Hall). She is sexually infatuated with – and thinks she is pregnant by – Randy. Despite her attraction to Randy, she becomes engaged to Shorty and has to bed him before the end of the series so that he will believe that he is the father. But despite her best attempts, and Shorty's feelings for her, the consummation never happens. In the final episode, it becomes clear that Kath is not pregnant.

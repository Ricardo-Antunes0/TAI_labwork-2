Worm theology is the idea in Christian theology that the Bible teaches that every creature, including worms, has a soul.  Worm theology has been around for centuries and is found in many faiths. It is based on the idea that the Bible teaches that every creature, including worms, has a soul. This doctrine is seen as contrary to the scientific view that worms are simply mindless creatures without emotions or feelings.

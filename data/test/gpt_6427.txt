The Ancoats Hospital and Ardwick and Ancoats Dispensary were two hospitals in Manchester, England, that were operational from 1848 to 2006.  The Ancoats Hospital was originally the Manchester Infirmary, a private hospital founded in 1848 by the philanthropist and cotton merchant, William Anson. It was later renamed the Ancoats Hospital in recognition of its location on Ancoats Lane, a short distance from the city's commercial heart on Deansgate. The hospital initially served as a general hospital for the surrounding working-class district, but also admitted patients from other parts of Manchester. In 1896, it became a municipal hospital under the control of Manchester City Council.  The Ardwick and Ancoats Dispensary opened in 1877 as a dispensary providing medical care to the local working-class population. It merged with the Ancoats Hospital in 1897. The dispensary closed in 2006 due to a lack of funding.

After Capitalism: Economic Democracy in Action is a book by Canadian author Naomi Klein. It was published in 2007 and is a synthesis of Klein's work on economic democracy, including her earlier books The Shock Doctrine and No Logo.  After Capitalism advocates for a transition to a society in which economic decisions are made democratically, through decentralized institutions such as worker cooperatives, community-owned businesses, and regional currencies. The book draws on concepts from Marxism, anarchism, and environmentalism to argue that capitalism is unsustainable and that a new system is required to provide social justice and protect the environment.  Klein has stated that the book is not about proposing a specific model of society, but rather about providing an overview of different models and ideas that could lead to a more just and sustainable economy. After Capitalism has been described as both practical and theoretical, and has been widely praised for its accessible writing style and its advocacy of democratic economic decision-making.

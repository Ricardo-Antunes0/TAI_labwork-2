Born in the village of Baddeck, in what is now Nova Scotia, McLeod was educated at the Royal Military College of Canada. He entered political life in 1878, when he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal Member of Parliament for the riding of Victoria. In 1883, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada.  In 1915, McLeod was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party. He served as Premier from 1915 to 1920, and during his time in office he introduced a number of major reforms, including a new education system and a land-survey and title-registration program. McLeod also played a leading role in negotiations that led to Manitoba's entry into Confederation in 1949. He later served as federal minister without portfolio from 1922 to 1924. McLeod died in 1924 at the age of 70.

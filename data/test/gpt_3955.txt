A honky-tonk is the place where the destitute go to drink and gamble. Benny Rubin (Benny Rubin), a down-and-out musician, is at the Honky Donkey trying to make ends meet. He has a dream of becoming a great country singer, but he doesn't have the money to travel or to buy the clothes that would help him make a good impression. Benny's only chance of making it big is to win a major talent contest sponsored by a crooked gambler named Jed Harris (Edgar Kennedy). Jed is using the contest as an opportunity to launder money that he's stolen from the townspeople. Benny has no other choice but to try to win the contest.

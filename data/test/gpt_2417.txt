Tinea capitis (also known as "herpes tonsurans", "tinea capitis herpetiformis", "tinea capititis", "tinea cruris", or "tinea pedis") is a common scalp infection caused by the fungus Trichophyton tonsurans, which can be spread through close contact with an infected individual. It is characterized by a red, itchy rash that can form thick crusts on the scalp. The rash may also spread to other parts of the body, and can be very severe. Treatment typically involves antibiotics and topical creams.

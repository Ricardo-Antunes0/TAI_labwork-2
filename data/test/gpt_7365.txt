Archibald Joseph McCarthy (born January 21, 1881) was an American politician who served as the senior United States Senator from Wisconsin from 1951 to 1957, and again from 1959 to 1971. A Republican, he was a key figure in the McCarthyism investigation of the U.S. government during the early 1950s.  McCarthy graduated from Marquette University in 1903 and worked as a lawyer in Milwaukee. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1940, and served until his death in 1971. McCarthy is best known for his leading role in investigations of alleged communist infiltration of the U.S. government and U.S. media, which gained him national attention and later led to his downfall in 1957.

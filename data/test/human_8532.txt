After her parents divorced, her mother married an artist, who moved the family to Ohio. Her mother and stepfather ran a cleaning business. When she was 12, Myers and her siblings were taken out of school when the family moved, this time to Florida, where they remained throughout her teen years. During this period, Myers began singing, writing songs on keyboard, and teaching herself (and learning from her brother) to play bass and guitar. She played in a band named Feeling Numb that her brother started and named in Coral Springs, Florida.

Kill!" (1965), "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls" (1967), and "Vixen" (1968), which established him as one of the most popular and controversial filmmakers of the 1960s.  Meyer's later works include the pornographic feature films "Pornography" (1981), "Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles" (1986), and "American Gigolo" (1980).

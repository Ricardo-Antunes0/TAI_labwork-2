Epichorista aspistana is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae. It is endemic to New Zealand and has been collected in Canterbury and Otago. This species inhabits moist grassy areas at altitudes ranging from sea level to 1650m. Larvae feed on species within the genus Acaena. Adults are on the wing in November to February. Taxonomy This species was first described by Edward Meyrick in 1882 using specimens collected by J. D. Enys at Porters Pass and named Proselena aspistana. Meyrick went on to give a fuller description of the species in 1883. In 1911 Meyrick placed this species in the genus Epichorista. George Hudson, in 1928, discussed and illustrated this species in his book The butterflies and moths of New Zealand. In 1988 J. S. Dugdale confirmed this placement. In 2010 this placement was again confirmed by Robert Hoare in the New Zealand Inventory of Biodiversity. The male lectotype, collected at Castle Hill in Canterbury, is held at the Natural History Museum, London.

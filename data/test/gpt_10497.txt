Syntomiprosopus (meaning "short face") is an extinct genus of prehistoric bony fish. Fossils have been found in the Early Cretaceous of Alberta, Canada.  The genus Syntomiprosopus is known from a single specimen, NRM P-11448, which was discovered in the Early Cretaceous of Alberta, Canada. The specimen is currently housed at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Drumheller, Alberta.  The fossil was first studied by Canadian paleontologist R.W.T. MacKenzie in 1959, and the genus was erected for it by him the same year. The type species is Syntomiprosopus longipes.  Syntomiprosopus is a relatively small genus, with only one known species. The fossil remains are fragmentary and poorly preserved, making it difficult to determine specific features of the fish anatomy. However, analysis of the characteristics of the skeletal structure suggest that Syntomiprosopus was an active predator that likely fed on smaller fish.

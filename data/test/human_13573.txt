Eileen Jensen Krige (1905–1995) was a prominent South African social anthropologist noted for her research on Zulu and Lovedu cultures. Together with Hilda Kuper and Monica Wilson, she produced substantial works on the Nguni peoples of Southern Africa. Apart from her research she is considered to be one of the 'pioneering mothers' of the University of Natal, Durban, South Africa, where she taught from 1948 until retirement in 1970. She inspired many women to devote themselves to research. Krige is also associated with a group of South African anthropologists who were strongly against the segregation policies of apartheid in South Africa. These include amongst others, Isaac Schapera, Winifred Hoernlé, Hilda Kuper, Monica Wilson, Audrey Richards and Max Gluckman. Personal life Krige married Jack Daniel Krige in 1928. Jack a nephew of J.C. Smuts and an advocate at the Transvaal Supreme Court, shared Krige's anthropological interests and subsequently accompanied her on most of her field trips. This might be closely linked to his earlier position as lecturer in Bantu Studies at Rhodes University College in Grahamstown. Together they were very successful in encouraging an interest in anthropology amongst African students. These include Absolom Vilikazi whose thesis Zulu Transformations was later published and Harriet Ngubane, famous for her book, Body and Mind in Zulu Medicine.

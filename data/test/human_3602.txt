Personal life He was born on 5 July 1947 in Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. His father Wimal Weerasinghe was an Editor-in-Chief of Lankadeepa newspaper. He studied science subjects at the Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa in English medium. But after S.W.R.D Bandaranaike made Sinhala as the official language, he lost the school life. At that time he had a serious car accident and was at home for about  years. It was during that time that he became more interested in writing. When Saman was out of school due to a language problem, his father went to Mapalagama Vipulasara Thera where he studied arts at the Paramadhamma Chethiya Pirivena in Ratmalana for 4 months. After that he went to the Pinwatta Pirivena in Panadura for A/Ls. When he was going to the Pirivena to do A/Ls, the monk who taught Sinhala asked a question about a renowned book and asked "why is it a masterpiece?". But Saman simply answered, 'That book is not a great book.' After that rift, he lost his education at pirivena.

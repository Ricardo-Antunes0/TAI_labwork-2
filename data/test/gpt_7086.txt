Cyborg anthropology is a discipline that studies the anthropological implications of cyborgs and their technologies. The field has its roots in cyberculture studies, but has developed its own research agenda, methodologies, and theoretical perspectives.  Cyborg anthropology is concerned with the ways in which humans are Changed and Transformed by the emergent technologies of cyberspace and the digital world. The field challenges traditional understandings of human nature and culture, and asks how cyborgs – both as individuals and as a social class – are implicated in globalizing processes. Cyborgs are seen not only as physical embodiments of technology, but also as cultural producers and shapers.  Cyborg anthropology is an emerging field, with a growing body of research publications. However, there is still much to be done in terms of developing a comprehensive understanding of cyborgs and their cultures. There is also a need for more interdisciplinary collaborations between scholars from different fields, in order to build on each other's research strengths.

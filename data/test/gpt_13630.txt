USS Hayler (DD-997) was a Spruance-class destroyer of the United States Navy. She was named for Commander James H. Hayler.  USS Hayler was laid down on 15 September 1944, at the Boston Naval Shipyard; launched on 20 October 1944; sponsored by Mrs. James H. Hayler; and commissioned on 8 January 1945, with Commander M.B. Carlson in command.  Hayler sailed from Boston on 26 January 1945, bound for the Pacific theater of operations. After shakedown off the California coast, she joined the 11th Fleet in early April and commenced operations in support of the Okinawa campaign. She screened carriers as they launched strikes against Japanese targets and patrolled off the island-group throughout the summer.  In September 1945, Hayler returned to the United States and resumed training duty with the Atlantic Fleet until sailing for Japan again in early 1946. This time she served as a unit of the U.S. occupation forces in Japan until decommissioned on 11 February 1947, at Yokosuka, Japan.   Following her decommissioning, Hayler was lent to Brazil for service as Escola de Guerra Naval (Naval War School). She was stricken from the Navy List on 15 January 1965, and sold for scrap to Nippon Sharyo Corporation, Kobe, Japan on 1 February 1965.

Demetrius (; died August 1277) was a Byzantine Emperor from 1081 to 1095. He was the eldest son of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos and Maria of Antioch.  Demetrius was born in 1081 to Emperor Alexios I Komnenos and his wife Maria of Antioch. He succeeded to the throne on the death of his father in 1081, and childhood illness forced him to away from Constantinople and spend time in the provinces.   In 1086, Demetrius launched a campaign against the Normans, but was unsuccessful. In 1087, he invaded Bulgaria, but was forced to retreat after being defeated at the Battle of Klokotnitsa. The Byzantine Empire suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, which led to its decline for over a century. The Normans were able to occupy most of southern Italy by 1050, and had made inroads into Byzantine territory in Anatolia by 1090. In response, Alexios began planning for a new campaign against the Normans, but Demetrius died before it could be launched.  Demetrius was married twice. His first wife was Irene Doukaina Kamaterina, daughter of Nikephoros III Doukas and Eudokia Kamaterina Monomachus. Irene died in January 1098, shortly after giving birth to their daughter Zoe. Demetrius then married Euphrosyne Doukaina (died 1120), widow of Michael VII Doukas Vat

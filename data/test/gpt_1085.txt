The Rental Car Rally is a 36-hour road rally that takes place in the United States every year. It is a non-profit event organized by the Rental Car Association of America (RCAA).  The rally began in 1984 as a way to promote the use of rental cars. The first rally was held in California and it has since grown to be one of the largest rallies in the United States. The rally features a variety of events, including a car show and a casino night.

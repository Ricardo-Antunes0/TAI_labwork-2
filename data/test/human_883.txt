The A4060, also known as the East of Abercynon to East of Dowlais Trunk Road, is a trunk road in Wales. The road starts at A470 The Pentrebach Roundabout South of Merthyr Tydfil. This first stretch is a 3 lane single carriageway road that was the old A470. It then comes to a roundabout by the Hoover Plant and The Premier Inn where there are links to Aberfan and Troedyrhiw via the A4054, Merthyr Town Centre via the A4054 (the old A470). The A4060 then leads to another roundabout a few yards up with turn offs to The Triangle Business Park and the Co Op Supermarket. After this roundabout the road becomes a dual carriageway with quite a steep Hill Climb. After about 3 miles there is another roundabout which has links to Mountain Hare and Dowlais Ind Est and the A4102. The other link is a Mountain Road to Cwm Bargoed and Fochriw. After the Roundabout the dual carriageway continues to Dowlais Top where there are links to Dowlais via the A4102, Neath (Brecon A470) via the A465, Abergavenny via the A465 and Fochriw and ASDA Supermarket

UV-B resistance 8 (UVR8) also known as ultraviolet radiation resistance 8 or UVR8 is a measure of a material's ability to resist the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation.  UV radiation is a type of electromagnetic radiation that is associated with the sun and can cause skin cancer and other health problems. Materials that are UV-resistant are less likely to be damaged by UV radiation and may be able to protect people from the health effects of UV exposure.  There are a number of different measures for assessing UV resistance, but UVR8 is one of the most commonly used. UVR8 is based on the idea that a material will resist damage from UV radiation if it can prevent more than 8% of the radiation from reaching its surface.

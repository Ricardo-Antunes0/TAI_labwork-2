Dalian Transcendence Football Club  is a Chinese football club based in Dalian, Liaoning. Founded in 2013, the club played in the Chinese professional league between 2014 and 2018. They quit from the professional league and turn as amateur in January 2019 when failing to apply professional league license. History Dalian Transcendence F.C. was established on 18 November 2013 by Zhao Yang  with a registered capital of 3 million Yuan to participate in the third tier of Chinese football at the beginning of the 2014 China League Two season. As a publicly listed football club Zhao Yang would proclaim that this model had already seen investment reach 10 million Yuan and he would be reinvesting that money on educating the team's youth system. Liu Zhongchang was brought in as the club's manager while the club's recruitment policy saw them actively bring in recently defunct Dalian Shide F.C. players, which included Han Jiabao, Hao Xingchen, Hu Zhaojun, Nan Yunqi, and Yan Song. With the club choosing the same blue home jersey colours and using the same home ground of Jinzhou Stadium it saw many within the Chinese media to believe that Dalian Transcendence were actively claiming to be the successor to Dalian Shide, Zhao Yang proclaimed to be neutral on the matter.

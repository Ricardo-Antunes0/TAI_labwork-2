Franziska Antoinette Hilleborg Carlsen (1817–1876) was a Danish writer who was particularly interested in local history and folklore. She was also a keen collector of items of historical interest. With the publication of her pioneering Noget om og fra Rønnebæk Sogn med Rønnebæksholm (Something about and from the parish of Rønnebæk and Ronnebæakshlom Manor) in 1861, she became one of the few women of her times to publish works documenting local folklore. Biography Born in Gammel Køgegård new Køge on 13 November 1817, Franziska Antoinette Hilleborg Carlsen was the daughter of the estate owner Christen Rasmus Carlsen (1777–1818) and his wife Else Margrethe née Nyhuus (1792–1857). She was the younger sister of Marie Toft who married the celebrated philosopher N.F.S. Grundtvig. She spent her adult life mostly in Rønnebæksholm Manor and Vallø Castle. While still young, she developed a particular interest in local history and began to collect material for documenting the history of the area.

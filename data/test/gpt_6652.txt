Bird Homestead, also known as the Bouton-Bird-Erikson House, is a historic home located at Monterey in Essex County, New York. It is a two-story, wood frame dwelling with a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade features a two-story, jerkinhead porch with turned posts and balusters. A one-story gabled ell extends to the rear of the house.  The house was built about 1805 by Major John Bouton and his wife, Esther Bird (Erikson). The Birds were early settlers of the area, and this is one of the oldest surviving houses in Monterey. The Bouton family owned the house until 1906, when it was sold to Dr. Julius Bird. Dr. Bird was a prominent physician in Monterey during the late 19th century and early 20th century. He served as the town's first doctor, as well as the town's first postmaster and school superintendent. The Birds remained in the house until 1943, when it was sold to John A. Erikson. Mr. Erikson was a successful businessman and one of the leading citizens of Monterey during the early part of the 20th century. He served as Mayor of Monterey in 1936 and 1937 and as Superintendent of Schools from 1922 to 1936. The house is now owned by the Essex County Historical Society and open to public visitation.  The Bouton-Bird-Erikson House is an excellent example of early 19th century architecture in Essex County, New York

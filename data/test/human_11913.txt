Sampietrini (also sanpietrini) is the typical kind of pavement found in the historic district of Rome and in St. Peter's Square, Vatican City. The earliest examples were made by trimming large blocks that had been used in ancient Roman roads, recently discovered in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century archaeological excavations. The first documented use in Rome of "sampietrini" stones was during the reign of Pope Pius V (1566-72). Over the next two centuries the stones were used to pave all the main streets of Rome, because this mode was superior to brick, for example by providing a smoother and stronger surface for carriages, among other reasons. Positive aspects of sampietre include:  it leaves small channels in between the individual bricks for water to pass through  it easily adapts to the irregularities of the ground  it is a strong material  after it has been laid down, it remains firm for a long time

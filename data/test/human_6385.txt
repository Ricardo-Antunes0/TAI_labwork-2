Lotsee Patterson (formerly Lotsee Smith; b. 1931) is a Comanche librarian, educator, and founder of the American Indian Library Association. She has written numerous articles on collection development, tribal libraries and Native American Librarianship. A Native American, Lotsee Patterson first became interested in collecting Native American objects, as her mother was a collections director. In the late 1950s, she read the 1983 publication The Museum Handbook of Native American History. She saw that Native Americans were less well documented than other cultures and often paid exorbitant prices for materials that were soon obsolete. Patterson is a University of Oklahoma Professor Emeritus of Library and Information Studies. Early life and education Patterson was born in 1931 and raised in southwestern Oklahoma, on a Native American land allotment near the town of Apache, Oklahoma. She started her professional career as a teacher at Boone School in 1959, a rural public school without a library. She taught at Riverside Indian School as well. These experiences led her to commit her professional life to determining the library needs of Native Americans and developing tribal libraries throughout the nation.

Ludwig Elster (26 March 1856 â€“ 30 December 1935) was a Prussian economist and university lecturer.   He also worked, between 1897 and 1916, as a senior officer in the Prussian Ministry for Religion, Education and Medical affairs. Biography  Ludwig Hermann Alexander Elster was born in Frankfurt am Main.   Carl Elster (1826-1902), his father, came from a Braunschweig family and was the son of a master baker:  he had worked as a Hanoverian diplomat, and represented Hanover at the Frankfurt Bundesversammlung (literally, "... Federal Convention"). After his sons were born Carl Elster moved into the private sector in 1866, when he became chairman of the Leipzig-based "Teutonia" Insurance business.   Ludwig Elster's mother, born Amalie Nolte (1829-1890), was a daughter of the head of the Hanoverian libraries service.   As a small boy he was privately tutored in Berlin.   Later, like his younger brother Ernst Elster (1860-1940), he attended the prestigious St. Thomas' [secondary] School in Leipzig.

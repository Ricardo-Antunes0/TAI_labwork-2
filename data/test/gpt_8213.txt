The 2012 Summer Olympics (officially the Games of the XXVII Olympiad) were a major international sporting event that was held in London, United Kingdom, from 27 July to 12 August 2012. A total of 10,600 athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in the Games. London was selected as the host city during the 119th IOC Session in Guatemala City, Guatemala, on 17 June 2005.     The official logo of the 2012 Summer Olympics is based upon the traditional five rings design of the Olympic rings. Designed by London-based graphic design firm M&C Saatchi, the logo features a simplified version of the ring symbol and is intended to be more modern and accessible. The slogan for the London 2012 Olympics was "Let's do this".  The Games received widespread acclaim with critics citing the high standard of competition as well as the unprecedented level of security as major successes. The opening ceremony was watched by an estimated global audience of 1.3 billion people with an estimated spending of Â£211 million. The Games were also deemed a great success due to the strong economic impact they had on London and Britain as a whole.

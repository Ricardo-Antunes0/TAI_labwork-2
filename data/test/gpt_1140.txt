Operation Grapple was a set of four military operations that took place in the Irak region in 2007 and 2008. The operations were conducted by the United States military in an effort to consolidate control of key territory in the region and to target Al-Qaeda terrorists operating in Iraq.  Operation Grapple was launched on 17 May 2007 with the objective of seizing control of the city of Mosul from militants associated with Al-Qaeda in Iraq. The operation was a success, and Mosul was taken without significant resistance. On 10 July 2007, Operation Grapple was expanded to include the city of Tal Afar, which had been under militant control for several months. Tal Afar was also captured without significant resistance.  On 3 August 2008, Operation Grapple was expanded again to include the city of Baquba. Baquba had been under militant control for several months, and its capture was seen as a key victory in the War on Terror. The operation was a success, and Baquba was captured without significant resistance.

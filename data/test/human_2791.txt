Rokeby is a Georgian house near Leesburg, Virginia, built in the mid-18th century. The house is the best example of Georgian architecture in Loudoun County. Rokeby served as a repository for U.S. Government documents during the British occupation and burning of Washington in 1814 during the War of 1812. The Declaration of Independence was reputedly kept in the basement. Description The main house is a two-story five-bay brick building standing on a low basement, with prominent end chimneys. The plan is two rooms deep with a central stair hall. A rear wing was added in 1886, using detailing that matched the original house. The main house is notable for its basement, in which the central portion features a brick barrel vault. A large kitchen was located in the basement; its hearth survives.  Renovations have altered much of the interior detailing, adding Colonial revival trim and plaster detailing. The exterior is built entirely in Flemish bomd.

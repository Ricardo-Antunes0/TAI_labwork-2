Kossuth Memorial refers to one of three important statues in Budapest, Hungary. The Kossuth Memorial was erected to commemorate the life and work of Lajos Kossuth, one of the most important figures in Hungarian history.  The Kossuth Memorial is located at the junction of Heroes' Square and Erzsébet Square in central Budapest. It is a bronze sculpture created by sculptor Mihály Munkácsy and was unveiled on 18 May 1896. The memorial is 17.5 meters high and weighs an estimated 85 tonnes. The statue shows Kossuth standing with his right hand raised in a gesture of solidarity, his left hand resting on the hilt of his sword.  The memorial has been the site of several important events in Hungarian history. On 19 November 1918, following Hungary's unification with Austria-Hungary, Kossuth's remains were brought here from Vienna and interred beside those of János Hunyadi, another key figure in Hungarian nationalism. On 4 March 1956, following Hungary's declaration of independence from the Soviet Union, protesters gathered around the monument to denounce the Soviet occupation. On 23 October 1989, following the fall of communism in Hungary, the memorial was damaged during a rioting spree that lasted for days.

Prognostics is an engineering discipline focused on predicting future performance of systems, devices, and components.  Prognostics is a field of engineering that focuses on predicting future performance of systems, devices, and components. The discipline is divided into three main areas: system performance prediction, device reliability prediction, and component reliability prediction. Each area has its own set of techniques and methods that can be used to predict the future performance of systems.  System performance prediction can be used to identify problems early and prevent them from causing significant damage or affecting the overall performance of a system. Device reliability prediction can be used to predict the likelihood that a device will fail in the future. Component reliability prediction can be used to predict the likelihood that a specific component within a system will fail in the future.  The techniques used in prognostics can be divided into two main categories: deterministic and stochastic techniques. Deterministic techniques are based on mathematical models that can accurately predict future behavior. Stochastic techniques rely on statistical analysis of past data to generate predictions about future behavior.  System performance predictions can be performed using simulation tools or mathematical models. Device reliability predictions can be performed using simulation tools or empirical testing methods. Component reliability predictions can be performed using simulation tools or empirical testing methods.

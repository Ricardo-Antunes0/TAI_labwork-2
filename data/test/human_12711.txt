Dendrobium lobbii, commonly known as the straggly rush orchid, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is native to an area extending from Indochina to northern Australia. It has thin, wiry stems with stiff leaves and mostly white or cream-coloured flowers singly or in pairs in leaf axils. Its white labellum does not open widely and sometimes remains closed. Description Dendrobium lobbii is a terrestrial, perennial, herb which forms small clumps. It has thin, wiry, erect or straggly stems  long with narrow lance-shaped leaves  long and about  wide with a notched tip. The flowers are white, cream-coloured or greenish,  long,  wide and are borne singly or in pairs in leaf axils. The sepals are  long, about  wide and the petals are about the same length but narrower. The labellum is white, about  long,  wide and has three lobes. The side lobes are small and narrow while the middle lobe is egg-shaped, notched and warty. Flowering occurs from December to May but the labellum does not open widely, sometimes remaining closed so that the flower self-pollinates.

Peter Felix (17 July 1866 â€“ 11 November 1926) was a boxer from Australia. Peter Felix was born on 17 July 1866 on the West Indian Island of St. Croix in the Danish West Indies, the same birthplace as the immortal Peter Jackson, who he claimed to be his first cousin (Jackson was actually in Felix's corner for some of his fights). Felix was tall for his time, standing at 6' 3" tall, and weighing in around 180 pounds. He was said to be a flashy dresser, extravagant and a bit of an extrovert, quite the opposite of the quiet, gentlemanly Jackson. He started his pugilistic career in Australia in 1894, with a 12th round knock out win over Dan Keeley in Melbourne. The year of 1895, proved to be one of the most fruitful of his career, with three very impressive points victories over Joe Goddard, and a points victory over Mick Dooley. 1896 saw him defeat Starlight Rollins, beat Mick Dooley in two out of three fights, and beat Dan Keeley for the Victorian Heavyweight title with a 5th round knock out win. The next two years saw him draw with Mick Dooley, Tut Ryan and Bill Doherty. During the depression years of the 1890s, Peter Felix also fought in unofficial bouts in travelling boxing troupe's, which toured the agricultural shows of Australia, putting on their fights in tents.

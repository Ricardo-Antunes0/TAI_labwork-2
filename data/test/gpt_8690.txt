The German name Spinnerin am Kreuz ("Spinner at the Cross") is given to a female street performer who entertains passersby with her spinning skills. She typically stands on a traffic island in the city center of Kreuzberg, Berlin, and performs for about an hour per day.  Since the early 2000s, Spinnerin am Kreuz has become a well-known fixture in Kreuzberg â€“ not only for her entertaining tricks and spins, but also for her friendly and approachable demeanor. She is known for her lively conversations with her fans, and is often seen handing out flyers advertising her performances.  Despite being a street performer, Spinnerin am Kreuz is not entirely self-reliant. She receives help from a team of assistants who help her set up and take down her equipment, and who also keep an eye on her safety.  Spinnerin am Kreuz is an important part of Kreuzberg's cultural heritage. Her unique style of performance has won her many fans over the years, and she is known for her lively interactions with her audience.

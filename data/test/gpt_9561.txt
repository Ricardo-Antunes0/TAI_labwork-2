A promissory note, sometimes referred to as a note of credit, is a document in which the borrower agrees to repay a specified sum of money to the lender at a specific time or on specific conditions. The note may be unsecured or secured by a security interest in the borrower's property.  The promissory note is one of the oldest forms of financial contracts. It is used to finance various kinds of transactions, including purchases, loans, and investments. The promissory note has been used throughout history as a form of collateral for loans. Promissory notes are also used as a form of investment.  A promissory note is a legally binding promise by one party (the issuer) to pay another party (the bearer) an amount of money at a future date, with interest and penalties if not repaid on time. The note may be unsecured or secured by a security interest in the borrower's property. The holder of the promissory note has the right to demand payment of the principal and interest on the note at any time, usually in cash. If the holder makes such a demand, the debtor may be forced to sell assets to meet the demand.  The promissory note is an ancient form of financial contract. It was first used in Babylonian law in about 1800 BC as collateral for loans. Promissory notes were later used as a form of investment. Today, promissory notes are still used as collateral for loans and as a means of investment.

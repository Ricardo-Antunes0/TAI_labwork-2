A dacha  is a seasonal or permanent residence in the countryside, typically in a natural setting with extensive gardens and yards. In the former Soviet Union and some other post-Soviet states, it is a symbol of affluence and luxury.  The word dacha is derived from the Russian word дача (dacha), meaning "estate", "farm", "estate", or "ranch". The word was first recorded in 1696 in the work of Peter the Great's courtier Gavrila Derzhavin.  In Russian, dachas are usually called by their location rather than by their owners' names (e.g., Volokolamskoe, Tsarskoe Selo). This is different from English, where the terms 'cottage', 'cabin', or even 'summer home' are used generically to refer to residences in the country regardless of their owner's name.

Football is the most popular sport in Angola, followed by basketball. The national team qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany and many Angolan footballers play internationally, particularly in Portugal and France. The top national league is the Girabola. The country was a Portuguese colony since the late 15th century. And so it was the Portuguese who popularized football there. Football in Angola is still shaped by its Portuguese origins and relationships, for example through a number of affiliates of the Portuguese clubs Benfica Lisbon and Sporting Lisbon. Also, many Angolan footballers play internationally, especially in Portugal, but also in France, but mostly in lower leagues. The national football association of Angola is the Federação Angolana de Futebol (FAF). It was founded in 1979, after Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975. The FAF organizes the national football leagues Girabola (1st league) and Gira Angola (2nd league) and is also responsible for the Angolan national team of men and women.

"Esquisse d'un Programme" (Sketch of a Programme) is a French political manifesto written by Jean-Paul Sartre in 1943. It is considered to be a key work in the French existentialist movement.  The manifesto is written in an style that mixes philosophical argument, political analysis, and anecdotal detail. It proposes a radical new way of thinking about society and politics, based on the idea that humans are fundamentally free and responsible for their own lives.  Sartre's ideas have had a significant impact on subsequent French political thought, and the manifesto has been cited as an influential influence by figures such as Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.

A barangay tanod, also known as a community or village watchman, is an informal appointed position in the Philippines that is typically responsible for policing their community and keeping order. They are also responsible for providing basic public safety services such as reporting illegal activities or emergencies, and assisting the police when requested.  The tanod system is a tradition that can be traced back to the Spanish colonial period. At this time, there were few formal law enforcement institutions available to monitor the population, so the barangay tanod was created as an informal patrol officer. Today, the tanod system remains an important part of Philippine law enforcement, and is often used to supplement the more formal police forces.

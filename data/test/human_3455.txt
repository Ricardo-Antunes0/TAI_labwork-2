Dharangaon is a city and a municipal council in the Jalgaon district in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Dharangaon is also the tehsil headquarters in Jalgaon district. The majority of the population is from the Marathas (Patil), Mali (Phul), Rajput (Purbhe), Dhangar, Badgujar and Teli communities. Dharangaon is the birthplace of the Marathi poet Balkavi . History Dharangaon was formerly known as Mina Nagar. At the time of the Moghal conquest in the 10th century, Dharangaon was famous for its jirifaf and bhiran clothing. During the seventeenth century, under the reign of Dongong, Dorongon, and Drongom, it was mentioned by multiple sources as a trade center of considerable importance. In 1674, English settlers established a factory in the town. The following March, the town was plundered by King Chhatrapati Shivaji. Four years later in 1679, King Shivaji joined forces with the Raja of Berar and again plundered Dharangaon, which at that time was one of the most flourishing places in the country. In 1683 the Drongom investment was 10,000 pieces broad bastas, 10,000 pieces sevgazis, and 100,000Â lbs. (2500 mans) of turmeric. In 1685 King Sambhaji plundered the town, burning or pillaging every house. The factors at Dharangaon had but two hours to escape. Under the Marathas, Dharangaon suffered much from Bhil raids and was the scene of one of the Bhil massacres by which the Marathas vainly attempted to keep order.

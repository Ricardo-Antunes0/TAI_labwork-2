Watersmeet House is a National Trust property in the village of Watersmeet, in the county of Cumbria, England. The house is situated on the eastern bank of the River Derwent, opposite the village of Low Water.  The house was built in 1750 for John Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale, on the site of an earlier house which had been destroyed by fire. Lonsdale was the son of Sir John Lowther, one of the most influential figures in eighteenth century England and a close friend and political ally of George II. Watersmeet House was one of the first houses in England to be built with a watertight roof.  Lonsdale died in 1768, and the house passed to his eldest son, John Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale. He died in 1792, and the house passed to his younger brother, William Lowther, 3rd Earl of Lonsdale. William died in 1814, and the house passed to his son, John Frederick Lowther, 4th Earl of Lonsdale. John Frederick died in 1821, and the house passed to his son, Henry Richard Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale. Henry Richard died in 1849, and the house passed to his younger brother, William Henry Frederick Lowther, 6th Earl of Lonsdale.   Watersmeet House remained in the possession of the Lowther family until 1955. The National Trust acquired it in 1954.

Worldwide media use the term colour revolution (sometimes coloured revolution) to describe various protest movements and accompanying attempted or successful change of governments that took place in several countries of the former Soviet Union, the former Yugoslavia and People's Republic of China during the early 21st century. The term has also been more widely applied to several other revolutions elsewhere, including in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region and South America, dating from the late 1980s to the 2020s. Some observers (such as Justin Raimondo and Michael Lind) have called the events a revolutionary wave, the origins of which can be traced back to the 1986 People Power Revolution (also known as the "Yellow Revolution") in the Philippines. Some of these movements have had a measure of success, for example, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's Bulldozer Revolution (2000), Georgia's Rose Revolution (2003), and Ukraine's Orange Revolution (2004). In most but not all cases, massive street-protests followed disputed elections or requests for fair elections. They led to the resignation or overthrow of leaders regarded by their opponents as authoritarian. Some events have been called "colour revolutions" but differ from the above cases in certain basic characteristics. Examples include Lebanon's Cedar Revolution (2005) and Kuwait's Blue Revolution (2005).

Tarantism is the debut album by Los Angeles rock band Tito & Tarantula, released in 1997. The album was the first full-length CD that the band ever released, after developing a fan base from performing the songs "After Dark", "Angry Cockroaches (Cucarachas Enojadas)", and "Opening Boxes" on the From Dusk Till Dawn soundtrack as well as the songs "Back to the House (That Love Built)", "Strange Face (of Love)", and "White Train" to the Desperado soundtrack, both of those films by Robert Rodriguez, who co-produced the album. Several members of the band were also featured in From Dusk Till Dawn, playing as the band in the "Titty Twister" bar, performing "After Dark" and "Angry Cockroaches (Cucarachas Enojadas)", and are well-remembered for the scene. Music videos were made for "After Dark" and "Back to the House (That Love Built)", using clips from the films mixed with footage of the band performing them.

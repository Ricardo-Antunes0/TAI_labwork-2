Saint-Georges (sometimes unofficially called Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock) is a commune of French Guiana, an overseas region and department of France located in South America. It lies on the Oyapock River (which forms the border with Brazil), opposite the Brazilian town of Oiapoque. The town contains a town hall, a French Foreign Legion detachment, and some hotels (the main ones being Le Tamarin, Coz Cal√® and the Chez Modestine). History Several short-lived colonies had been founded on the Oyapock River. In 1604, Charles Leigh founded Oyapoc for Great-Britain. After a mutiny, the colony was abandoned in 1606. In 1620, Roger North tried again, but was forced to abandon the colony in 1629. In February 1677, John Apricius founded a Dutch colony, and constructed Fort Orange. In June 1677, they were attacked by the French, and shipped back to the Netherlands. In 1723 or 1724, Fort Saint-Louis was constructed at or near the Dutch fort. In 1734, a Jesuit mission was established at Fort Saint-Louis. In 1744, they were attacked by Great-Britain, and the settlement was abandoned.

My Little Airport is a Hong Kong-based indie pop band. Their English lyrics are marked by spelling, grammar, and rhythm inflected by Hong Kong English. The band's lyrics and music are written by Ah P (Lam Pang) and sung by Nicole (Nicole Au Kin-ying). The duo occasionally invite friends (Ah Suet, who speaks French, for instance) and relatives (Nicole's younger sister) to participate in their albums and shows. They established Harbour Records with four other indie bands from Hong Kong, and on it released their 2004 debut album The OK Thing to Do on Sunday Afternoon Is to Toddle in the Zoo. In 2006 they joined Elefant Records, hoping to gain distribution beyond Hong Kong's small indie fanbase. Career The band had its start while the two were journalism students at Hong Kong Shue Yan College (now Hong Kong Shue Yan University), writing songs in both English and Cantonese. They intended to put into use lessons learnt in class, and as a result this is why many of their songs have been said to follow the Five Ws: "Who?", "What?", "Where?", "When?", "Why?" as journalistic works typically do. The duo is also notable for their quirky song titles, often addressed to friends, such as "leo, are you still jumping out of windows in expensive clothes?", "victor, fly me to stafford", or addressed to celebrities, such as "Gigi Leung is dead", "Faye Wong, about your eyebrows".

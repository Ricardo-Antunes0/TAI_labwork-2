Arieh Warshel (; born November 20, 1940) is an Israeli composer, conductor and pianist.  Warshel was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, to a Jewish family. His father, Yitzhak Warshel, was a composer and music educator. Arieh studied composition with Shlomo Mintz at the Rubin Academy of Music in Jerusalem and with Leonard Bernstein at the Tanglewood Music Center in Massachusetts. He also studied conducting with Kirill Kondrashin and piano with Haim Goldberg.  Warshel's early works were influenced by the late 20th century minimalist and serialist composers such as Terry Riley and Karlheinz Stockhausen. He later moved towards a more avant-garde style, incorporating elements of jazz, electronic music and world music into his work. In the 1990s he began to focus on creating new modes of musical expression through the use of acoustic and electronic instruments.  Warshel has been awarded several prizes for his music, including the Berlin Prize in 1989 and the Krakow Prize in 2003. He is currently director of the Chamber Music Department at the State University of New York at Purchase.  Warshel has also been a prolific composer for film and television, scoring films such as "The Mambo Kings" (1998), "Beaufort" (2006) and "The Ice Storm" (2002), as well as television shows such as "The Sopranos", "ER", "Lost" and "Homeland".

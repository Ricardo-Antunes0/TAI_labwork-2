is the 36th single by the Japanese idol girl group AKB48. It was released in Japan on May 21, 2014 by King Records. This single was first performed at AKB48's concert in the National Olympic Stadium on March 29. It was the best-selling single of the year in Japan, with 1,786,825 copies. Synopsis The song tells the story of two young lovers who meet again at the beach resort where they had first met during the previous summer.  They have arrived early this year, because they had not had enough time together the year before for their relationship to even progress to their first kissâ€”she asks if they should do that now.  They had met when chasing the girl's childhood pet, a Labrador Retriever, as he played along the water's edge; this inspired her to give her new love the nickname "Labrador."  The three of them chase across the beach as they had that first day, and she calls her love into her arms and asks (for the third time) if they should have their first kiss.

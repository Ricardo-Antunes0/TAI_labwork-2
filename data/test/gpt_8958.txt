In mathematical logic, in particular in model theory, an internal set is a subset of a set V that is itself a subset of the set of all sets. In other words, every set in V is an internal set, but not every internal set is a set.  An internal set is a subset of a larger set that can itself be a subset of some other larger set. For example, the integers are an internal set, while the natural numbers are not. The integers can be subsets of the natural numbers, and the natural numbers can be subsets of the integers.  There are many reasons why one might want to consider an internal set. For example, one might want to consider the elements of a given set in isolation, without considering the relationships between them. Another reason for considering an internal set is because one wants to study the properties of sets that are themselves internal sets.

In configuration management, a baseline is an agreed description of the attributes of a product, at a point in time, which serves as a basis for defining change. A change is a movement from this baseline state to a next state. The identification of significant changes from the baseline state is the central purpose of baseline identification. Typically, significant states are those that receive a formal approval status, either explicitly or implicitly. An approval status may be marked individually, when a prior definition for that status has been established by project leaders, or signified by association to a position above or below the established baseline.  Nevertheless, this approval status is usually recognized publicly.  Thus, a baseline may also mark an approved configuration item, e.g. a project plan that has been signed off for execution.  In a similar manner, associating multiple configuration items with such a baseline indicates those items as being approved.

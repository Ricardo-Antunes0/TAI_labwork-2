Amphion (1886 â€“ 30 October 1906) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse best known for being the first Triple Crown racehorse in history.  Amphion was sired by the great stallion Nearco and out of the mare Amphitrite. He was bred by John J. R. McKean and raced in New York and Maryland.  Amphion made his racing debut in 1887, winning a two-mile maiden race at Monmouth Park. In 1888, he won the prestigious Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course. The following year, he won the Belmont Stakes at Belmont Park, becoming only the second horse after Nearco to win the Triple Crown.  Amphion retired after winning a single race in 1890, but was later inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

Hans Hopf (August 2, 1916, Nuremberg â€“ January 9, 1976, Munich) was a German mathematician. Hopf proved the Hopf conjecture, which concerns the existence of solutions to nonlinear systems of differential equations.  Hopf was born in Nuremberg, Germany in 1916 and died in Munich in 1976. He attended the University of Munich and received his Ph.D. in 1939. He was a professor at the University of Munich from 1943 until his death. From 1965 until his death he was also chairman of the mathematics department at Munich.  Hopf is known for his work on the Hopf conjecture, which concerns the existence of solutions to nonlinear systems of differential equations. He proved the conjecture in 1954. He also made contributions to mathematical physics, mathematics education, and recreational mathematics.

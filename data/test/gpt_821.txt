Halostagnicola larsenii is a non-motile, aerobic, gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. It was first identified in 1994 from a sample taken from the hydrothermal vent at the Halocline Zone of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. The species is named after marine biologist Hal O. Larsen, who first discovered the hydrothermal vent at which it was isolated.

Larsen, who first discovered the hydrothermal vent at which it was isolated. The bacterium is unique among known organisms because it can grow at high temperatures and pressures, and its cells are resistant to many environmental agents.  Halostagnicola larsenii is a phototroph that derives energy from light via the photosynthesis pathway. The bacterium produces hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide as byproducts of photosynthesis, and can use these gases to sustain itself in anaerobic environments. Halostagnicola larsenii is also known to be capable of respiration using organic matter as an energy source.

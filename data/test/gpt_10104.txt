The Kosovoâ€“Serbia land swap is a proposed relocation of the borders between Kosovo and Serbia. The swap would see the Serbian province of Kosovo, which is largely populated by ethnic Albanians, moved to the Republic of Serbia. The move is controversial, as many Serbs fear that it would lead to Albanian domination of Kosovo. The proposal has been rejected by both Kosovo and Serbia's governments.  The land swap proposal was first raised in 2007 by then-Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica. The idea was met with resistance from the governments of Kosovo and Serbia, as well as from international organizations such as the United Nations. In February 2017, however, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic announced that he had revived the proposal, and that he was willing to trade the province of Kosovo for some other territory in Serbia.   The proposal has been met with criticism from both Kosovo and Serbia's populations. Many ethnic Albanians in Kosovo fear that they would be forced to leave their homes if the land swap were to take place. Others worry that the move would lead to increased Albanian dominance over Kosovo. There is also concern that a land swap would create a new border between Serbia and Albania, which could lead to increased conflict between the two countries.   There has been little progress made on the proposal since President Vucic announced it in February 2017. There is currently no indication as to whether or not he plans to pursue the idea further.

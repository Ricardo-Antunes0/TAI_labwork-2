Brainclaw is an industrial/electronic music project initially created at Ithaca College, NY in 1989 by David Giuffre. The band centers on Giuffre, but features many guest artists on its releases. Notable songs are "Insekt/Angel" and "When The Dark Rains Come" which were used on the DVD releases of The Matrix Revolutions, The Matrix Box Set and the Spider-Man Collector's Edition. Brainclaw was signed to BLC Productions in Little Rock, AR, and briefly to UK label, Juggernaut Music Group. The band is currently releasing music under its own imprint, Auroviral. Early years The Brainclaw project began as an ongoing experiment in composing aggressive electronic music, born at Ithaca College in 1989. Pennsylvania, USA-native David Giuffre decided to begin composing more polished compositions with the end result of publishing a full album of electro-industrial music, using the large body of mostly unfocused and unfinished work he had created up to that point, from 1985 to 1988. He continued to accumulate new music gear and build what would eventually become Studio Auroviral.

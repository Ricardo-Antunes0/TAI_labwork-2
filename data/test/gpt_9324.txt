Out Hud was an American electronic band from the 1990s.  Formed in Los Angeles, California in the early 1990s, Out Hud was one of the first electronic groups to achieve mainstream success. The band released three studio albums and several successful singles before splitting up in 2000. Despite their short lifespan, Out Hud is remembered for their innovative and experimental music, which was heavily influenced by acid house and electronica.   Out Hud's music is often considered to be an important precursor to the electronica and house movements of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The band's eclectic style, which fused elements of funk, techno, and acid house, helped to create an innovative sound that was unlike anything else on the radio at the time. Out Hud's influence can be heard in artists like Daft Punk, Justice, and The Chemical Brothers.

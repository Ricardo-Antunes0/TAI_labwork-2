The Glitter Dome is a 1984 American made-for-HBO crime drama film starring James Garner, Margot Kidder and John Lithgow.  The film, based on the 1981 Joseph Wambaugh Hollywood-set homicide novel, was directed by Stuart Margolin, who also scored the film and played a supporting part.  The movie was filmed in Victoria, British Columbia and co-starred Colleen Dewhurst.  It was subsequently released on video in 1985. The film was also the last film for John Marley. Synopsis The Glitter Dome is a bar frequented by the Hollywood police detective division (the name is a slang reference to Hollywood).  When the investigation of a high-profile studio president is going nowhere, the case is handed over to two experienced detectives, Al Mackey (Garner) and Marty Welborn (Lithgow). For this case, however, they need help, which they receive from a pair of vice cops called the Ferret and the Weasel and a pair of street cops commonly referred to as the Street Monsters, due to their fondness for violence.

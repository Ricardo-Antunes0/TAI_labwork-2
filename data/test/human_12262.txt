The Final World Tour (also referred to as The Farewell Tour) was the final concert tour by American thrash metal band Slayer, which began on May 10, 2018, and ended on November 30, 2019. The tour, consisting of 147 shows worldwide, served as a conclusion of the band's three-and-a-half-decade-long career. Background The tour was announced on January 22, 2018 through a video featuring a montage of press clippings, early posters and press photos spanning Slayer's entire career. Although the members of the band have never explained the decision to retire from touring, fans believe one of the reasons behind this was at the expense of vocalist/bassist Tom Araya's desire of no longer wanting to tour and spend more time with his family. The first leg of the North American tour was announced the day after, which took place in May and June 2018 and included support from Lamb of God, Anthrax, Behemoth and Testament. The second leg of the North American tour was announced on March 5, 2018; this leg took place in July and August, and featured four out of five bands from the first leg (Slayer, Lamb of God, Anthrax and Testament) and Napalm Death as the replacement for Behemoth.

A thermal blanket is a device used in thermal desorption to clean soil contamination. The primary function of a thermal blanket is to heat the soil to the boiling point of the contaminants (usually 100 to 325 °C and as high as 900 °C) so that they break down. A vacuum pulls the resulting gas (along with volatilized contaminants) into a separate air cleaner that may use various methods, such as carbon filters and high-heat ovens, to completely destroy the contaminants. Aside from evaporation and volatilization, the contaminants may also be removed from the soil through other mechanisms such as steam distillation, pyrolysis, oxidation, and other chemical reactions. Due to their placement, the thermal blanket can only be used in shallow areas, which is around 1 meter. The process can take more than 24 hours to treat 6 inches of soil and up to 4 days for contaminated areas with depths of 12 to 18 inches.

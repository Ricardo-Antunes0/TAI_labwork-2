The Grossglockner Races were hillclimbs for automobiles and motorcycles held in 1935, 1938 and 1939 on the Grossglockner High Alpine Road crossing the Central Eastern Alps in Austria. History Hillclimbs were held in Austria since about 1900 on courses in the Vienna Woods (Exelberg Race) and at Semmering Pass, as well as on the Gaisberg mountain road near Salzburg, a venue of the European Hill Climb Championship from 1929–30. When after five years of construction the Grossglockner High Alpine Road was opened in the year 1935 as a high-altitude scenic route crossing the main chain of the Alps between the Austrian states of Salzburg and Carinthia, the High Society of the Austrian motorsport gave a powerful demonstration of its presence, including Vice-Chancellor Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg and chief engineer Franz Wallack. The first International Grossglockner Hillclimb took place on August 4, 1935, only one day after the official opening of the road. After the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany, still two further races should follow in 1938 and 1939; they had been named according to the political development Großer Bergpreis von Deutschland (Hillclimb Grand Prix of Germany).

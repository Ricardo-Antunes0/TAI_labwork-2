was the name of a group of forts and castles located in the Miyagi Prefecture of Japan.   The forts were built in the late Muromachi period to secure the approaches to the capital of the province, Sendai. The forts were besieged and taken by the forces of Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1598 during his campaign to unite Japan under his rule. In 1614, H≈çyo Fortress was rebuilt by Ieyasu Tokugawa as part of his efforts to consolidate power in the region. The forts were destroyed by fire in 1892.

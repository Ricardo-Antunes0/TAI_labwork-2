Live! Bootleg is a double live album by American hard rock band Aerosmith, released in October 1978. While most of the performances were drawn from concerts in 1977 and 1978, "I Ain't Got You" and "Mother Popcorn" were taken from a radio broadcast of a Boston performance on March 20, 1973. Background The design of the album is intended to ape the poor production values offered by contemporary bootleg records, even going so far as to give an incorrect track listing: the song "Draw the Line" is included on the record but does not appear listed; the track is a secret track after "Mother Popcorn". The album also features a secret live instrumental cover of "Strangers in the Night" inserted into their cover of "Train Kept A-Rollin'", which was probably a nod to a similar quote by Jimi Hendrix during "Wild Thing" at the Monterey Pop Festival. The back of the CD cover includes two coffee stains over the picture of Joe Perry playing before a live audience. The original LP cover had the coffee stains, but not the picture of Perry, which was part of the gatefold artwork. The record also features one of Aerosmith's first live versions of The Beatles "Come Together", which they performed in the 1978 movie Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and the first record appearance of Richie Supa's "Chip Away the Stone" (the studio version of this song would later be released on 1988's Gems compilation).

Wabanquot, Wabonaquod, Wah-bon-ah-quot, Wau-bon-a-quat or Wa-bon-o-quot (ca. 1736-1794) was a chief of the Chippewa people who lived in what is now the United States. He was a major figure in the early history of Michigan, and was influential in the Treaty of Greenville, which opened up most of the northern Great Lakes to white settlement.  Wabanquot was born circa 1736 near Lake Superior, likely on the island of Isle Royale. He became a noted war leader and hunter, and eventually became a chief of the Chippewa people. He played an important role in the Treaty of Greenville, which opened up most of the northern Great Lakes to white settlement. Wabanquot also played a key role in the early history of Michigan, helping to negotiate treaties with other tribes and establishing relations with European traders.  Wabanquot died in 1794 at the age of 63. He is buried in what is now Mount Hope Cemetery in Detroit.

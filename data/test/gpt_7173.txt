Professional liability insurance (PLI), also called professional indemnity insurance, professional liability insurance policy or professional liability insurance contract, is a type of insurance that protects professionals from civil or criminal liabilities arising from their professional activities. The policy usually covers damages caused by the insured person's negligence, as well as allegations of professional misconduct.   PLI policies are typically bought by professionals who are liable for damages that they may cause to others. The policy may also cover the costs of defending a lawsuit. PLI policies are also popular among corporations and other organizations that employ professionals.  PLI policies usually cover both damages caused by the insured person's own negligence and allegations of professional misconduct. Coverage may extend to actions taken in the course of business, even if the insured person is not involved in the business activity at the time of the incident. The policy can also provide protection for claims resulting from clients or customers.  The coverage provided by a PLI policy is based on an assessment of the risk posed by the particular profession or activity. The insurer will typically consult with a specialist to develop a policy that provides the appropriate level of coverage.   PLI policies are subject to a number of exclusions, including coverage for acts or omissions that are within the scope of one's profession or activity; coverage for intentional acts or omissions; and coverage for claims made as part of a contract with a client or customer. In addition, PLI policies generally do not cover losses caused by third-party actions, such as vandalism or theft.

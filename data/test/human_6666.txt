Background On September 15, 2014, he announced that his seventh studio album would be titled Hood Billionaire and set the release date for November 24, 2014. In an October 2014, interview with Power 105.1's The Breakfast Club, he spoke about why he wanted to release two albums in 2014, saying: "That’s how bosses do it, ya heard me? That cake so stacked up we ain’t even gotta do that. Then if we text Def Jam you know they’ll bring that bag…It was just something that I wanted to do when I recorded the music. If you go back and listen to my interviews speaking on Mastermind I was saying I felt like I made two albums because it was two different feelings. Mastermind was the type of album that I wanted to open up. I wanted it to have a rich feel to it…That throwback Puff feel mid-way through it. And this right here. Just certain energies. And this right here this my Geechi Liberace. This a gold ring on every finger. We holding the bottles in the sky letting the champagne run down our arm. So, it’s just that feel good record. A lot of 808s, real bass heavy. And it’s gon’ feel different to you. So, it's gonna feel like a full year from the boss."

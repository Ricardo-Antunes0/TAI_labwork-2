TheDailyBugle.net is a faux American current affairs digital series serving as the center of several viral marketing campaigns for Marvel Studios and created by Sony Pictures. Based on the fictional sensationalist news outlet of the same name that appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)—itself based on the fictional newspaper agency of the same name appearing in several Marvel Comics publications—the YouTube videos began as marketing for the film Spider-Man: Far From Home, and deal with major events depicted in the MCU's films, with the second season primarily airing on TikTok. The first season of the news program features J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, reprising his role from the MCU films and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy. Several other actors reprise their roles from the films, while archival footage of others is also used. The initial videos were released from October to November 2019, focusing on the immediate aftermath of Spider-Man: Far From Home. A second season, leading up to the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home and featuring Angourie Rice reprising her role as Betty Brant, were released from November to December 2021.

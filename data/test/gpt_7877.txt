Spiridon (;  1379â€“d. 11 August 1389) was the Patriarch of Constantinople from 1383 to 1389.  Spiridon was a monk of the monastery of Mount Athos, and served as its prior from 1356 to 1363. He was appointed patriarch by Emperor John V Palaiologos in 1383, and soon became embroiled in a dispute with the powerful nobleman Constantine Palaiologos. Spiridon was forced to resign in 1389, after a conspiracy against him was discovered. He died shortly afterwards.

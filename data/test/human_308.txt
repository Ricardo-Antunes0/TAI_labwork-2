Hobart Huson, also known as Strike, is the founder and site designer of online forum The Hive and author of several popular books such as Total Synthesis I and II, and Sources, in which he details methods of synthesizing a variety of amphetamines, obtaining equipment and chemicals, and avoiding prosecution for said activity. From his books, it is clear that MDMA or Ecstasy was the drug he found to be most compelling (although he asserts in his book Total Synthesis II that MDA is preferable to MDMA): in his book Total Synthesis II, he describes it as "the most benign drug [I have] ever encountered." Huson posted on The Hive under the pseudonym Strike and was considered something of an expert on the topic of underground drug synthesis but his true identity was revealed following a ten-month investigation by NBC show Dateline. A special episode of Dateline called The "X" Files was aired in 2001, after which he was arrested and imprisoned for various drug charges pertaining to the manufacture of MDMA.

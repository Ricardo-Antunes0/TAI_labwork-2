Lower Huxley Hall is a moated manor house in Cheshire, England, located about   southeast of Chester. It lies roughly halfway between the villages  of Huxley (to the southeast) and Hargrave (to the southwest), It dates from the late 15th century, with major additions and alterations in the 17th century.  A small addition was made to the rear in the 19th century.  It was originally a courtyard house, but only two wings remain. The house is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. History The house was originally the seat of the Clive family.  John Tilston inherited the property upon the death of his elder brother Henry in 1613. Their father Ralph Tilston had purchased half of the Huxley estate from a relative Ralph Huxley in 1580. During the English Civil War the house was taken over by Colonel Croxton and the Parliamentary forces on September 5, 1644, and served as a base for the Siege of Chester. In 1810 it was described as being a farmhouse, and was still so in 1935. There is also a Higher Huxley Hall located less than half a mile immediately to the south which dates to at least the 13th century and is now run as a hotel.

My Brain Hurts is the third studio album by the Chicago-based punk rock band Screeching Weasel. The album was originally released on CD, vinyl and cassette in September 1991 through Lookout Records. It was the group's first album on Lookout as well as the only release with bassist Dave Naked and the first with drummer Dan Panic, the latter of which would go on to appear on several of the band's albums. The album marked a very distinct stylistic shift for the group, fully moving toward a Ramones-inspired sound and completely abandoning their previous hardcore punk influences as a condition made by vocalist Ben Weasel when reforming the band after a brief break-up. After the release of My Brain Hurts, the band grew increasingly popular within the punk community and began drawing bigger crowds at their shows, which Weasel later admitted put pressure on him when recording the follow-up album Wiggle the next year. The album is regarded as one of the group's best releases by critics, fans and the band members themselves. It is one of the band's best-selling releases and is often cited as influential to many later pop punk bands.

George Gascoigne (c. 15357 October 1577) was an English playwright, poet and actor. He was the son of an innkeeper and is best known for his comedies, which are often characterised by their sharpness of wit.  Gascoigne was born in 15357 October 1577 in Gosforth, Northumberland, England. He was the son of an innkeeper and began working in his father's business at a young age. In 1544 he married Agnes Strickland, with whom he had six children. Gascoigne began writing plays in the 1550s and during the 1560s he became a prominent playwright in London, writing for both the public stage and the court theatre. He died in 1577.

The T-13 was a tank destroyer in the Soviet Union's army during World War II. It was the last tank destroyer designed and produced in the Soviet Union.  The T-13 was a development of the T-12 tank destroyer. The T-13 featured a new turret with a more powerful 45 mm gun and improved armour. The T-13 entered production in 1941, although it did not see combat until 1943. The T-13 was used to great effect in the Battle of Kursk, where it accounted for several hundred German tanks. However, the T-13 was eventually obsolete and was withdrawn from service in 1945.

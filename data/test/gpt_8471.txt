Infectious canine hepatitis (ICH) is an acute viral hepatitis caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). ICH may occur in any dog, but is most commonly seen in middle-aged to older dogs. It is also seen in cats. ICH is a serious disease and can be fatal if not treated quickly.  The primary symptoms of ICH are fever, anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea. Other symptoms may include jaundice, muscle pain, and lethargy. The dog may also develop a rash. If the dog becomes dehydrated or has organ failure, it may die.  There is no vaccine or cure for ICH, but treatment with antiviral drugs can help to prevent the disease from progressing to cirrhosis or liver cancer. Treatment should be started as soon as possible after the dog is diagnosed with ICH, and should continue for as long as the dog remains ill.

Cauda Pavonis are an English deathrock band founded in 1998, by Su Farr (later Wainwright) and Dave Wainwright. Originally conceived as a 'dark romantic' experience, Cauda Pavonis broke onto the UK goth circuit supporting acts such as Star Industry and Inkubus Sukkubus. At the outset Cauda Pavonis were noted for their consciously-minimalist synthesized melodies and their use of live drums (uncommon during the late 1990s in UK goth music). They were described by Mick Mercer in his book 21st Century Goth as a "Dark duo from UK with a bright future" and by Starvox as "The most old school sounding goth since Rozz Williams hung himself". Since then the line-up has grown and the band have appeared twice at the Whitby Gothic Weekend (2001, 2008) and the Wave-Gotik-Treffen. In 2003 and again in 2007, Cauda Pavonis were the focus of the ITV television programme, Magick Eve. History Formed in 1998 Cauda Pavonis concentrated on writing â€” it was not until 1999 that they made their debut at the two-day festival Distopia 2, held at the Bristol Bierkeller. Between the 2000 Pistols at Dawn album and the 2001 Controversial Alchemy album, the band was fairly quiet as in September 2000 the band's tour schedule came to a halt when Farr broke her ankle.  Across 2001 and 2003 they continued to tour, taking their album Controversial Alchemy across the UK.

Vahman-Ardashir or Bahman-Ardashir, also known as Forat-Ardashir, was the first king of the Sasanian Empire, reigning from 379 to 383. He was the son of Shapur I and the brother of Ardashir I.  Despite being the first Sasanian king, little is known about his reign. Bahman-Ardashir appears to have been a competent ruler, and managed to maintain peace and stability in the empire despite constant attacks from the Roman Empire. He also undertook several successful military campaigns against the Roman Empire, culminating in a victory over the Roman general Gratian at the Battle of Carrhae in 383. However, Bahman-Ardashir died shortly after the victory, and was succeeded by his son Ardashir II.

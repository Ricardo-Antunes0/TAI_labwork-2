George Whitmore Jr., (-1968) was an man who was charged but later cleared of the infamous Career Girls Murders. "The Supreme Court cited Mr. Whitmore’s case as “the most conspicuous example” of police coercion when it issued its 1966 ruling in Miranda v. Arizona, establishing a set of protections for suspects, like the right to remain silent." In April the following year, Elba Borrero identified Whitmore as the man who attacked her. Upon his arrest, photos of a white blonde woman were found in his possession and were believed to be that of Janice Wylie. Brooklyn police announced that Whitmore had confessed to the Wylie-Hoffert and Edmonds murders and the attempted assault of Elba Borrero, who had identified him as her attacker. At a news conference it was announced that Whitmore had given details of the Wylie-Hoffert murders that only the killer could have known. It was stated he had drawn a detailed diagram of the apartment and had in his wallet a photo of Janice Wylie that had been stolen from the flat.

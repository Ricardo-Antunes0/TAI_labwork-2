Advancement is a common law doctrine of property law that holds that a beneficiary of an estate or trust may inherit an increased share of the assets of the estate or trust as compared to what would have been the case had the original creator of the estate or trust survived to distribute the assets. The doctrine offers beneficiaries a chance to benefit from someone else's hard work, and can result in an increased share of an estate's or trust's assets.  The doctrine is based on two principles: first, that a beneficiary is entitled to what is left after other creditors are paid; and second, that a beneficiary is entitled to what was intended by the creator of the estate or trust. In order for a beneficiary to benefit from advancement, he or she must be able to prove both principles.   The doctrine has been applied in different ways in different jurisdictions. In some cases, advancement is automatic; in others, it must be specifically conferred by a written instrument. The amount of advancement awarded will vary depending on the jurisdiction and the type of estate or trust involved.   Advancement is most commonly used in estates and trusts involving property owned by individuals, but it has also been applied in cases involving property owned by businesses and organizations

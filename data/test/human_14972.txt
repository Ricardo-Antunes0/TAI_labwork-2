HMS Satyr was an  destroyer which served with the Royal Navy during the First World War. Launched on 27 December 1916, Satyr joined the Harwich Force under the command of Commander Hubert de Burgh. In 1917, the destroyer formed part of a force protecting the monitors  and  in their bombardment of Ostend. As part of this action, Satyr, along with sister ships ,  and ,  sank the German destroyer S20. After the war, the ship served with the Torpedo School at the Devonport. In 1923, the Navy decided to retire many of the older destroyers in preparation for the introduction of newer and larger vessels and Satyr was sold to be broken up on 16 December 1926. Design and development Satyr was one of ten  destroyers ordered by the British Admiralty in December 1915 as part of the Seventh War Construction Programme. The design was generally similar to the preceding  destroyers, but differed in having geared steam turbines, the central gun mounted differently and minor changes to improve seakeeping.

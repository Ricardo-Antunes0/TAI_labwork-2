A circadian advantage is an advantage gained by organisms that have a natural rhythm, such as humans, birds, and other animals. This is because these organisms are able to optimize their physiology to take advantage of the natural rhythms of the Earth. For example, humans are able to sleep at different times throughout the day and night based on the Earth's natural 24-hour cycle.  The circadian rhythm is a natural cycle that affects many aspects of human physiology. It consists of a set of physiological processes that cycle between active and inactive periods throughout the day and night. The active period is when the body is doing its most work, such as during daytime hours. The inactive period is when the body is resting or sleeping.  The circadian rhythm has been shown to play an important role in human health. For example, it has been shown to play a role in regulating hormone levels, metabolism, and behavior. The circadian rhythm also affects how sick people feel, how long they take to recover from illness, and how easily they fall asleep and wake up.  The circadian rhythm can be affected by a number of factors outside of our control. These factors can include exposure to light and darkness, time of year, and environmental stressors (such as noise).  The circadian rhythm can be altered by drugs and medications, such as caffeine and nicotine. Some diseases also affect the circadian rhythm, leading to changes in sleep patterns and health problems.  The circadian rhythm is also affected by artificial light sources, such as computer screens and cell

George Lawrence Mikan Jr. (; June 18, 1924 – June 1, 2005), nicknamed "Mr. Basketball", was an American professional basketball player for the Chicago American Gears of the National Basketball League (NBL) and the Minneapolis Lakers (now the Los Angeles Lakers) of the NBL, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) and the National Basketball Association (NBA). Invariably playing with thick, round spectacles, the ,  Mikan is seen as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, as well as one of the pioneers of professional basketball.  Through his size and play he redefined it as a game dominated in his day by "big men".  His prolific rebounding, shot blocking, and talent to shoot over smaller defenders with his ambidextrous hook shot (the result of the  Mikan Drill created with his college coach at DePaul University Ray Meyer, where Mikan was a three-time All-American) all helped change the game.  He also utilized the underhanded free-throw shooting technique long before Rick Barry made it his signature shot. Mikan had an extremely successful playing career, winning seven NBL, BAA, and NBA championships in ten seasons, an NBA All-Star Game MVP trophy, and three scoring titles. He was a member of the first four NBA All-Star games, and the first six All-BAA and All-NBA Teams. Mikan was so dominant that he prompted several significant rule changes in the NBA, including the introduction of the goaltending rule, the widening of the foul lane—known as the "Mikan Rule"—and the creation of the shot clock.

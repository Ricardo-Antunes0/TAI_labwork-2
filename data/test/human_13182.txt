Erotica was an adult, consumer exhibition held each November at Olympia, London, UK. A mainstream ‘lifestyle show’ aimed primarily at women and couples, where visitors were encouraged to celebrate or re-kindle their relationships with goods and services aimed to enhance their love lives. Erotica's organisers have claimed that it is the world's largest lifestyle show "for freethinking adults who are comfortable with their sexuality". Erotica cancelled its 2014 show and has since shut its doors. Exhibitors, including many small- to medium-sized companies and sole traders, offered: fashion, corsetry, lingerie, shoes, jewellery, art, photography, sculpture, adult toys, games, books, DVDs, furniture and romantic gifts. Popular, free entertainment includes: stage shows that run several times each day and are produced by London's Torture Garden; Dreamboys; entertainers that wander among the crowds; workshops and demonstrations (including glamour photography, bodycasting, and burlesque classes); and a team of NHS sexual health advisors offering free advice, condoms, and chlamydia testing. Erotica is keen to promote safe, respectful and responsible sex, and welcomes visitors of all persuasions – straight, gay, and transgender.

Operation Konyn  was a military operation by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) to overthrow the Ugandan government. The LRA was considered a terrorist organization by the United States until 2008.  The Ugandan military and the United States began Operation Konyn in late 2007 in an effort to capture LRA leader Joseph Kony. The operation consisted of a three-phase campaign: aerial reconnaissance, targeted airstrikes, and ground operations. By the end of 2008, Kony had been captured or killed, resulting in a decrease in LRA activity.  Operation Konyn was one of several operations conducted by the Ugandan military against the LRA; others include Operation Lightning Thunder and Operation Nile Blue.

Luis Alberto MacGregor Krieger (1918–1997) was a Mexican architect, son of the architect Luis MacGregor Cevallos. He is also the grandfather of Mexican architect Augusto Rodelo Mac Gregor.  He was a professor for a period of time at the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City.  One of his first projects was the design and construction of the small museum for the archeological site of Cuicuilco in southern Mexico City, which still stands and operates today. His predominant architectural style was Modernist , with many influences from his contemporaries during the mid century movement around the world. His college thesis was the design for a new Mexican National Museum of Archeology and Natural History which during that time was a very innovative idea and design. Prior to his thesis, all archeological artifacts and study groups in Mexico were located on several warehouses, museums and government facilities scattered across the country without a proper organizational system or building. His thesis revolutionized and triggered the efforts to create such institution in Mexico City. .

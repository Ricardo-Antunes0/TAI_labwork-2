The sai (Japanese: 釵, lit. 'Hairpin'; Chinese: 鐵尺, lit. 'Iron Ruler') is a traditional Asian melee weapon used for striking and blocking. It is most famously used in ninjutsu and kobujutsu, but also in southern Chinese martial arts. The basic form of the weapon is that of a sharp metal prong with two curved sideprongs (yoku) projecting from the handle (tsuka). There are many different types of sai with varying prongs for trapping and blocking. History Before its arrival in Okinawa, the sai was already being used in other Asian countries including India, Thailand, China, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It may have been brought to Okinawa from one or several of these places simultaneously.  Based on the Indian trisula, early evidence in the form of Japanese art shows that the chabang predates the sai's use in Okinawa and China. The word trisula itself can refer to either a long or short-handled trident. Because the trisula was created in India, it is possible that the sai originated in India and spread along with Hinduism and Buddhism. This is supported by the fact that the trisula is important as a Hindu-Buddhist symbol.

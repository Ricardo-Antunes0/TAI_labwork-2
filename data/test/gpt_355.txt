SS Indiana was an iron passenger-cargo steamship that operated on the Great Lakes during the late 19th century. She was the first ship to be built in the state of Indiana and was also the largest and most advanced steamship on the Great Lakes at the time of her construction.  Indiana entered service in 1873 and was a popular ship among tourists and freight customers. In 1877, she became one of the first ships to be equipped with an electric light system. SS Indiana remained in service until 1902, when she was retired from service. After her retirement, Indiana was used as a warehouse for a number of years before being destroyed by fire in 1924.

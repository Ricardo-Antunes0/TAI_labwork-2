An uninterruptible power supply or uninterruptible power supply system (UPS) is a device or system that supplies electrical power in the event of a power outage.  An UPS typically has a battery that can provide power for a short time after the primary power is lost. Typical uses for an UPS include powering computer systems and other electronic equipment during a power outage, providing backup power to medical devices, and providing emergency power to critical infrastructure.

S100A1, also known as S100 calcium-binding protein, is a calcium-binding protein that in humans is encoded by the S100A1 gene.  The S100A1 protein is a calcium-binding protein that is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and testes. The S100A1 protein has been shown to play a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Additionally, the S100A1 protein has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and multiple myeloma.

Margaret M. Taylor Fox (1857 â€“ c. 1929) was an American actress and heiress who became the last surviving member of the theatrical Fox family.  Born into a theatrical dynasty, Taylor Fox began her career in amateur theater and made her Broadway debut in 1879. She achieved critical success for her performances in Shakespeare and in plays by George Bernard Shaw. Her most famous roles were as Mrs. Danvers in the 1925 play Rebecca and as Alicia Thorndike in the 1927 film The Great Ziegfeld.  After retiring from acting, Taylor Fox devoted herself to philanthropy and social work. She was a founder of the Children's Aid Society and the Margaret Sanger Research Foundation, and served on the board of directors of both organizations. She died in 1929 at the age of 75.

Edmund the Martyr (also known as St Edmund, Edmund of Canterbury, Edmund of Shrewsbury, and Edmund of Westminster) was an English bishop, abbot and theologian who was killed in the Battle of Hastings in 1066.  Edmund was the son of a nobleman named Ã†thelred and his first wife Emma. He was educated in Winchester and at the University of Paris. On his return to England, he became a monk at Bec Abbey. He soon became known as a learned man, and in 1045 he was made Bishop of Worcester.  In 1051, Edmund became Archbishop of Canterbury, a position he held until his death. While archbishop, he played a leading role in the compilation of the Domesday Book. He was also a noted scholar and writer, writing works on theology, history and poetry. Edmund was a defender of the Catholic Church against the reformers led by Henry I.  Edmund died in the Battle of Hastings in 1066, fighting against the Norman invasion of England. He is considered one of England's greatest martyrs and is honoured by both the Catholic and Anglican churches. He is also a national figure in Jamaica, where he is considered one of its patron saints.

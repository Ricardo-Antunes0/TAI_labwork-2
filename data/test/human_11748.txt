The Conference Basketball League (CBL) was a second-tiered men's semi-professional basketball league in New Zealand. During the 1980s and 1990s, the CBL served as a means of promotion and relegation between the National Basketball League (NBL). By the 2000s, it served as a means for associations to enter representative teams into a national division two competition. The CBL also served as a feeder league for development or academy squads of NBL teams. History The Conference Basketball League (CBL) ran every year between 1981 and 2008, and consisted of multiple conferences throughout its lifetime, including northern, capital, central, and southern. From seven teams in 1996, the CBL grew to 25 teams spread over four conferences in 1999. The challenges facing the league by the late 2000s were similar to the national women's league, namely finding a format that teams could economically support. Basketball New Zealand chose not to host the CBL in 2009, before bringing it back in a one-off, five-day tournament in 2010.

Vaiava Strait (Samoan: Vāinuu o Vaiava) is a strait on the island of Samoa that separates the islands of Upolu to the north and Savai‘i to the south. It is about 8 km wide at its narrowest point, and about 60 km long.  The strait is named after the Vaiava people, an indigenous Samoan people who inhabit a small area around the strait.

Ann Manley (c. 1828 â€“ after 1870) was an American abolitionist and women's rights activist. She was one of the most high-profile women in the antislavery movement, and one of the first women to speak publicly on behalf of women's rights.  Manley was born in 1828 in New York City, the daughter of a prosperous white merchant. She was educated at home, reading widely and studying languages. In 1851, she married James H. Manley, an abolitionist minister, and moved to Boston.  Manley quickly became involved in the abolitionist movement, speaking out against slavery and working to raise money for the cause. In 1865 she helped to organise a mass meeting in Boston to protest against the imprisonment of Frederick Douglass.  Manley remained active in the women's rights movement throughout her life. In 1870 she helped to organise a meeting of prominent American women to discuss their rights. The meeting led to the formation of the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA), of which Manley became president the following year.  Manley died after 1870, but her work continued to influence later generations of feminists. She is considered one of the most important women in American history, and her legacy is commemorated annually with a holiday called Ann Manley Day.

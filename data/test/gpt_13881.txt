Perampanel, sold under the brand name Fycompa, is a medication used to treat epilepsy in adults. It is a type of anticonvulsant medication known as a GABAergic agent. It is taken by mouth, and works by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses in the brain.  Perampanel was first developed in the Netherlands in the 1990s. It is now available as a generic medication. The drug is generally well-tolerated, with few major side effects. Perampanel is not approved for use in children under the age of 12 years old, and should not be used in patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

Florence Helen Woolward (1854 Hammersmith â€“ 3 January 1936) was an English botanical illustrator and author, and was commissioned by Schomberg Kerr, 9th Marquess of Lothian to paint his extensive orchid collection, and published in parts between 1891 and 1896 as "The Genus Masdevallia".    Miss Woolward was a freelance artist and the daughter of Reverend Woolward. She lived in Belton, Lincolnshire and through the Talbot Sisters was commissioned by Schomberg to paint orchids and fungi from Newbattle Abbey and Monteviot House. She received no formal training as artist or botanist, but on completion of the project for Schomberg, she worked at the Natural History museum. "The Genus Masdevallia" is considered one of the finest illustrated orchid books of the Victorian age. The Marquess had a boundless passion for orchids, in particular the Andean Masdevallias of which he had a sizeable collection at Newbattle Abbey in Scotland. Most of these came from Friedrich Carl Lehmann, who was a regular advertiser in the pages of "The Gardeners' Chronicle". Pressed flowers from Newbattle Abbey are still preserved at the Natural History Museum. Spending some ten years on visits to Newbattle Abbey, Florence depicted more than 350 orchids, of which 85 were Masdevallias.

The Wonder (foaled 1978) was a French-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was most successful in middle-distance races and made his first success in a maiden race over one and a half miles at York Racecourse in 1979. He won the Middle Park Stakes, the Eclipse Stakes and the Grand National in 1980 before becoming a successful breeding stallion.  The Wonder was owned by Lord Weymouth, who sent him to race in Britain. He was ridden in most of his races by Dick Hern. In 1980 The Wonder became the first horse to win the Grand National over four miles, beating Thunder Gulch by six lengths. After his retirement from racing he had some success as a breeding stallion, producing several successful horses including Festival Bay, who won the 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby.

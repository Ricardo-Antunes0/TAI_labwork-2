Chronic egg laying  is a maladaptive, chronic behavior in which a female bird lays eggs over an extended period of time, typically more than one per day. This behavior can lead to obesity, malnutrition, and health problems for the bird.  Chronic egg laying is typically seen in hens that are not getting enough nutrition or are not getting enough exercise. The eggs may be laid even if there is no food available to the hen. The hens may also lay eggs even when they are not mating.  Chronic egg laying can lead to many health problems for the bird, including obesity, malnutrition, and health problems related to the build-up of egg yolk and cholesterol in the bird's bloodstream.

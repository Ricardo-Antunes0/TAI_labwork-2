Percé Rock (, meaning "pierced rock") is a large, sheer-sided rock on the north side of the Taku River in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is one of the most famous landmarks in the territory and a popular tourist destination.  The rock is located at the junction of the Taku and Liard Rivers, about upstream from their confluence. It rises abruptly from the river's bed and is capped by a steep cliff face that drops abruptly to the water. The rock is accessible only by boat or helicopter.  The name Percé Rock comes from the Inuit word for "pierced rock". The first Europeans to see it were James Cook and his crew on their 1778 voyage along the Pacific Coast. They named it after Jean Pierre Perce, an officer on Cook's expedition.   Percé Rock is a popular tourist destination, with visitors attracted by its dramatic scenery and its associations with early exploration and trade in the Northwest Territories. The rock is also used as a filming location for movies and television shows, including "The X-Files", "Northern Exposure", "Smallville", "Eureka", and "Arrow".

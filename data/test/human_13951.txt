Husk Power Systems, founded in 2008, is a company based in Fort Collins, Colorado, that provides clean energy services to off-grid or weak grid rural communities in East Africa, West Africa and South Asia, primarily by building renewable energy mini-grids/micro-grids. Its original technology generated electricity using a biomass gasifier that created fuel from rice husks, a waste product of rice hullers that separate the husks as chaff from the rice, a staple food in both Asia and Africa. In the mid-2010s, with the rapid decline in the price of solar PV and batteries, Husk pivoted its business model to focus more on solar-plus-storage mini-grids (what at the time Husk coined "mini power plants"), while continuing to use biomass in combination with solar to serve communities with larger electricity demand. In 2021, Husk Power was recognized in the REN21 Renewables Global Status Report as the first mini-grid company to achieve significant scale, by surpassing 100 solar hybrid community mini-grids, and 5,000 small business customers. In 2022, Husk signed an Energy Compact with the United Nations, in which it set a target of building 5,000 mini-grids and connecting 1 million customers by 2030. Husk Power has raised around $40 million in equity from investors. In 2018, it raised a Series C totaling $20 million from Shell Technology Ventures, Swedfund International and Engie Rassembleurs d'Energies, with FMO coming in later with an additional $5 million. Other investors have included The Rockefeller Foundation, Acumen, US International Development Finance Corp. and First Solar.

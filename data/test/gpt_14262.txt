A Nantucket sleighride is the dragging of a sleigh over the snow or ice on Nantucket, Massachusetts. It is an old custom that has been revived in recent years as a tourist attraction.  The sleighride is an Old World tradition brought to New England by early European settlers. The horses are led by a driver, and passengers are transported over the snow or ice in a sleigh pulled by horses, dogsled, or a motorcycle. The ride begins at the town center and ends at a designated stop, typically on the beach.

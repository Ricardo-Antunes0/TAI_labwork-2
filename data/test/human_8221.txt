Brita, "the wife of Jöran Pipare" (floruit 1595) was an alleged Swedish witch. Her case is a significant one, illustrating a witch trial held when the belief in witchcraft had increased, but the law still did not permit harsh persecution of magic practice.  Brita is described in court protocol as "Brita, fru till Jöran Pipare" ('Brita, wife of Jöran the Flute player'). In September 1593, Brita was charged with sorcery in Stockholm alongside the cunning woman "Margareta from Norrsunda". Margareta was active as a folk magician who practiced medicine, exposed thieves and gave rest to ghosts by magic charms: however, as she denied to have used these charms to hurt any one, she was acquitted with a reprimand, as the court did not take her seriously.  Brita was accused of having caused illness as well as economical damage to some of the city merchants by use of magic. She admitted to have used signeri (spells) and lövjeri (potions), but she denied to have had any dealings with the Devil.

The Judean Civil War was a conflict fought by the Jewish people of Judea against the Roman Empire from 66 to 73 AD.  The war began as a series of revolts by different factions of the Jewish population, but soon escalated into a full-blown civil war. The Roman army was initially successful in quelling the rebellions, but eventually suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Beth Horon in 73 AD, which led to the annexation of Judea by the Roman Empire.  The Judean Civil War has long been regarded as one of the deadliest and most destructive conflicts in Jewish history, with an estimated 150,000 people killed and tens of thousands more wounded.

It is also used in linguistics and sociology.  Pattern theory explores the relationships between patterns and their structures. It is a general theory of information that applies to a wide range of problems.  Pattern theory has been used to study a variety of topics, including the structure of code sequences, the organization of data sets, the learning process of artificial intelligence systems, and the development of natural language processing algorithms.

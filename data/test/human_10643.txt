Lady Eleanor Grey (died before December 1503), was an English noblewoman, and the first wife of Sir John Arundell of Lanherne in Cornwall, "the most important man in the county", being Receiver-General of the Duchy of Cornwall. Their monumental brass in the church at St Columb Major in Cornwall was described by E. H. W. Dunkin (1882) as "perhaps the most elaborate and interesting brass to be found in Cornwall." Her father was Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset. Lady Eleanor was an ancestor of the later Barons Arundell of Wardour. Family and early years  Lady Eleanor Grey was a daughter of Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset, and Cecily Bonville, Baroness Harington and Bonville, one of the wealthiest heiresses in England in the latter half of the 15th century. Elizabeth's paternal grandmother was Elizabeth Woodville, Queen consort of King Edward IV of England, and thus her father was the half-brother of Edward V of England and Richard, Duke of York, the 'Princes in the Tower', and of their sister, Elizabeth of York, queen consort to Henry VII of England.

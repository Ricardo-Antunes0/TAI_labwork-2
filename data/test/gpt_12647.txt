Ludwig Elster (26 March 1856 – 30 July 1924) was a German mathematician and geodesist.  Elster was born in Saalfeld, Saxony-Anhalt, the son of a land surveyor. He studied at the universities of Berlin and Freiburg, where he obtained his doctorate in 1880 with a thesis on differential equations. In 1884 he became an associate professor at the University of Berlin, and in 1904 he succeeded Eugen Karl Dürr as full professor at the University of Kiel.  Elster is known for his work on mathematical geography, including his development of the Elster–Powell theorem and his work on the theory of triangulations. He also made contributions to differential geometry and point symmetry. He died in Kiel at the age of 79.

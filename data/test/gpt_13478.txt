The Stour Valley riots, also called the Plug Plot riots, were a series of riots and disturbances that took place in the Stour Valley area of east London in August 1966.  The riots were the result of a series of incidents, starting with the stabbing of a white teenager, which led to a series of retaliatory attacks against white civilians by local black youths. The riots lasted for four days, and resulted in the deaths of five people and the destruction of over 200 homes.  The riots had a significant impact on British race relations, and led to the introduction of tougher laws against rioting.

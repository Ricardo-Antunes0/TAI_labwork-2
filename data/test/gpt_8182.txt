Mount Constance is a peak in the Swiss Alps, overlooking the city of Constance. It is the highest peak in the canton of Graubünden and the second highest peak in Switzerland. At its summit is a refuge station and a cross.  The first human presence on Mount Constance is unknown, but it may have been used as an observatory by the Celts or Romans. The mountain was first climbed in 1799 by Christian Almer and his companions. In 1811, Johann Jakob Bodmer and Martin Schmieder ascended it from the east, followed in 1874 by Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi and Louis Terray. In 1895, Henry Morton Stanley climbed it from the west.   In 1922, a refuge station was built at the summit of Mount Constance. It is open to the public all year round. In 1948, a cross was erected on the summit of Mount Constance, which has become a popular tourist destination.

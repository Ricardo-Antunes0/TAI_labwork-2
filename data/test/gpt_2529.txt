The exclamation "O'zapft is!" (Bavarian for "It's done!") is used in various parts of the world as a form of punctuation, particularly in the German-speaking world.  The word "O'zapft" is formed from the words "O" (meaning "it") and "zapfen" (meaning "to puff"), and is pronounced as "ehz-uh-pf-t". It is most commonly used as a means of concluding a statement or act, or to express satisfaction. For example, someone might say "O'zapft is!" after completing a task or after receiving good news. O'zapft is also used as a way of saying goodbye, especially to friends and family.

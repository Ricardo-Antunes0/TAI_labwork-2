Carla Bruni-Sarkozy (born Carla Gilberta Bruni Tedeschi;[1] 7 October 1966) is a French singer-songwriter, actress, and fashion designer.  Bruni was raised in the town of Villefranche-sur-Saône, in the north of France. She began her career as a model at the age of 15, appearing in campaigns for Jean Paul Gaultier, Yves Saint Laurent, and Lagerfeld. Bruni made her acting debut in the 1986 film Le cercle. After making appearances in several films and television shows, she achieved mainstream success in 1993 with the album C'était une fois. The album produced four top ten singles in France, including "L'Heure bleue" and "Je t'aime". Bruni's following albums, My Songs (1996) and Un homme et une femme (1998), were less successful. Bruni's fashion career began in 1993 with the launch of her own couture line, Carla by Carla Bruni. She has since released three more collections: L'Épouse (2004), Je ne suis pas belle (2007), and Comme moi (2015).  Bruni married Nicolas Sarkozy in February 2005; he was President of France at the time. They divorced in May 2008. Bruni later had an affair with actor Jesse Owen. She has two children with Sarkozy: a son, Louis, born in 2007, and a daughter, Paloma Beatrice

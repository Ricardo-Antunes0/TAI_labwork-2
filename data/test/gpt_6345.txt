Apprenticeship is a system for training a person in a skilled trade or profession. It typically lasts two years, but may be longer. The apprentice usually earns a lower salary than the person they are training to be, and is required to contribute to the cost of their training.  Apprenticeship began as a system of training people in a skilled trade or profession. It started in the Middle Ages, when craftsmen would apprentice themselves to learn the trade. Today, apprenticeship systems are still present in many countries around the world.  Typically, apprenticeship programs include either an initial period of training, or an ongoing period of training and monitoring. During the initial period of training, the apprentice learns the skills required for their trade or profession. After completion of the initial period of training, the apprentice is usually placed in an apprenticeship program that continues to monitor and support their development.  There are several benefits to using an apprenticeship system. First, it allows for a close relationship between the apprentice and the person they are training to be. This relationship provides opportunities for both parties to develop skills and knowledge that will be beneficial when they become independent professionals. Second, an apprenticeship system is cost-effective. Due to the shorter duration of most apprenticeships, it is possible to train a larger number of people at a lower cost than traditional methods such as university education. Finally, an apprenticeship system allows for up-and-coming professionals to gain experience in a specific field before they make the leap into independent work.

Solid (Korean: 솔리드) is a South Korean R&B/Hip-Hop trio. They were formed in Orange County, California, in 1992, and made their debut in Seoul, South Korea, in 1993. The group consists of Johan Kim (김조한: George Kim), Jaeyoon Chong (정재윤: Jae Chong), and Joon Lee (이준: John Lee). The trio is dubbed as the "Kings of R&B" in South Korea for their contribution to establishing and popularizing the genre in Korea. They are considered to be one of the biggest influences in developing the current sound of K-pop – incorporating American styles and sounds, like  R&B, rap, hip-hop, a cappella, beatboxing, and turntablism, into Korean music – with commercial hits in the mid-1990s.  With Johan Kim's soulful vocal – often referred to as "R&B daddy," Jaeyoon Chong's song craftsmanship and producing ability, and Joon Lee's unique voice, rapping style and DJing skills, the trio have set themselves apart as pioneers in a country where the predominant soundtrack was residing in ballad and dance music. For their complementary set of skills, Solid has become one of the most beloved musical groups by Korean music critics, artists, and fans.

Asynchronous reprojection is a class of motion interpolation techniques aimed ensuring a virtual reality headset's responsiveness to user motion even when the GPU isn't able to keep up with the headset's target framerate, and to reduce perceived input lag at all times regardless of framerate. Reprojection involves the headset's driver taking one or multiple previously rendered frames and using newer motion information from the headset's sensors to "reproject" or "warp" the previous frame into a prediction of what a normally rendered frame would look like. "Asynchronous" refers to this process being continuously performed in parallel with rendering, allowing reprojected frames to be displayed without delay in case a regular frame isn't rendered in time, and is used in all frames by default to reduce perceived latency. The use of these techniques allows for a lowering in the video rendering hardware specifications required to achieve a certain intended level of responsiveness.

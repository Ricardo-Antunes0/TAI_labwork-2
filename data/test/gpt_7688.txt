Robot localization denotes the robot's ability to localize itself in its environment using sensors andnavigation algorithms.   The localization problem has been studied since the early days of artificial intelligence (AI). One of the earliest attempts to solve the problem was the so-called dead reckoning algorithm, which estimates a robot's position by measuring the time it takes for a known distance to travel. However, this method is unreliable and can be inaccurate if the robot's environment is cluttered or if its sensors are not precise.   More recent research has focused on developing autonomous navigation algorithms that enable robots to find their way in unfamiliar environments. These algorithms use data collected by the robot's sensors to create a map of the environment, and then use this map to navigate to specific destinations.   There are two main categories of robot localization algorithms: sensor-based and mapping-based. Sensor-based algorithms rely on the robot's sensors to detect and track nearby objects and landmarks. Mapping-based algorithms use pre-generated maps to guide the robot to specific locations.   The main advantages of sensor-based algorithms are that they are relatively easy to implement and they are relatively accurate when used in well-maintained environments. The main disadvantage of sensor-based algorithms is that they require a lot of data collection from the environment, which can be difficult if the environment is complex or if there are obstructions in the way. Mapping-based algorithms are generally more accurate than sensor-based algorithms, but they require more time

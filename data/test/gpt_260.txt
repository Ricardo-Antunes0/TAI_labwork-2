The Focke-Wulf Ta 183 Huckebein was a German all-metal monoplane designed by Kurt Tank in the early 1930s. It was a development of the Focke-Wulf Ta 152 fighter, and entered service with the Luftwaffe in 1935.  The Ta 183 was an elegant aircraft, with a streamlined fuselage and cruciform tail. It was powered by a single BMW 132 engine, which gave it a top speed of 460 km/h (290 mph). The Huckebein was used as a ground-attack aircraft, and saw action in the Spanish Civil War, the Battle of Britain, and the Invasion of Poland. In 1941, it was replaced by the faster Ta 184.

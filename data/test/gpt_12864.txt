HAIR-AN syndrome consists of hyperandrogenism (HA), insulin resistance (IR), and abnormal lipid profiles. The syndrome is caused by a mutation in the male sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) gene.  HAIR-AN syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation in the male sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) gene. The syndrome is characterized by hyperandrogenism (HA), insulin resistance (IR), and abnormal lipid profiles. HAIR-AN syndrome is most commonly associated with abnormalities in the levels of testosterone and SHBG, but can also involve other hormones, such as estradiol.  The cause of HAIR-AN syndrome remains unknown, but it is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The syndrome is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that both copies of the SHBG gene must be mutated for the disorder to develop. The syndrome is most commonly diagnosed in males who are between the ages of 10 and 30 years old, but can also occur at any age. There is currently no known cure for HAIR-AN syndrome, but treatment options include lifestyle changes, medication, and surgery.

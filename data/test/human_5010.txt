Saint Narek chapel is a chapel of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Vardenis village, Aragatsotn Province, Armenia.  The chapel was built in 2012 in the place known as the Narek of Papé.  The chapel was anointed on 25 August 2012. History  For centuries there was a Gospel called "Narek of Papé" in the village of Aparan, Kyuluja (now Vardenis).  The book belonged to a family whose paternal name was Papé, and it was called Narek not because it was the "Book of Lamentations" by Gregory of Narek, as it was customary for people to call it so, but for the fact that although it was a Gospel, it had a healing ability, so the villagers called it "Papé's Narek".  It was about the Gospel of miraculous medicine published in Constantinople in 1710.  Papé was carrying the book, and later it was in the house of his relatives, near the church of St. Hakob in the village.

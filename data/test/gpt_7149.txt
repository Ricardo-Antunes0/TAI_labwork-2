A privy seal refers to the personal seal of a monarch, used for correspondence and other official purposes. The term derives from the Latin word privare, meaning "to deprive", because the seal was used to prevent unauthorized persons from opening letters. The British Crown uses a variety of different privy seals, which are made from silver or gold.  The use of privy seals dates back to the ancient Egypt and Rome civilizations. In ancient Egypt, papyrus scrolls were sealed with an adhesive wafer that contained the king's personal seal. After being unrolled, the seal would reveal a list of names and titles of those who had received documents from the king. In Rome, letters were often sealed with the emperor's personal seal. This seal was used to authenticate the emperor's signature and to ensure that only he could read certain documents.

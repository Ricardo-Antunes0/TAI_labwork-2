Vermandois was a French county that appeared in the early modern period. It was located in the middle of the kingdom and its capital was Laon.  The county was created in 1512 by Francis I of France as a partition of the Duchy of Burgundy. It was initially named after the river Vermandois, which ran through it. The name was later changed to honour Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans, who had died in 1560.   The Vermandois county ceased to exist on 1 January 1790, when it was merged with the old province of Picardy into the new department of the Nord.

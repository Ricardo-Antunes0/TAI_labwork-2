Baron Montalt (sometimes given as Mohault or Moutalt) (c.1510- c.1582) was a French soldier, administrator, and explorer who played a key role in the development of New France as governor of Trois-Rivières from 1566 to 1572, and as lieutenant-general of the colony from 1573 to 1578.  Baron Montalt was born in the Auvergne region of central France in about 1510, the son of a notary. He entered the French army and served in Italy and the Low Countries before becoming governor of Trois-Rivières in 1566. He made important contributions to the development of New France, helping to consolidate French control over the region and establishing a system of government based on the French model. He also played a role in the exploration and exploitation of the resources of New France, including the fur trade and mining. Baron Montalt died in 1582.

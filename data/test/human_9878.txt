The bronzed cowbird (once known as the red-eyed cowbird, Molothrus aeneus) is a small icterid. They breed from the U.S. states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana south through Central America to Panama. They tend to be found in farmland, brush, and feedlots. Outside the breeding season, they are found in very open habitats, and roost in thick woods. These birds forage in open areas, often near cattle in pastures. Their diet mostly consists of seeds and insects, along with snails during breeding season for a calcium source. There are three subspecies:  M. a. loyei  Parkes & Blake, 1965 is found in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.  M. a. assimilis  (Nelson, 1900) is found in southwestern Mexico.  M. a. aeneus  (Wagler, 1829), the nominate subspecies, is found in South Texas and from eastern Mexico to central Panama The bronze-brown cowbird, which is restricted to the Caribbean coast of Colombia, was formerly considered to be an isolated population of this species.

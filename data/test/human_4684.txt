The Parker–Hulme murder case began in the city of Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand, on 22 June 1954, when Honorah Rieper (also known as Honorah Parker, her legal name) was killed by her teenage daughter, Pauline Parker, and Pauline's close friend, Juliet Hulme (later known as Anne Perry). Parker was 16 at the time, while Hulme was 15. The murder has inspired plays, novels, non-fiction books, and films including Peter Jackson's 1994 film Heavenly Creatures. Background Pauline Yvonne Parker (aka  Pauline Rieper) was born on 26 May 1938. She met Juliet Hulme, who was born in London, when they were both in their early teens. Parker came from a working-class background; while Hulme, who emigrated to New Zealand with her parents in 1948, was the daughter of Henry Hulme, a physicist who was the rector of University of Canterbury in Christchurch. They both attended Christchurch Girls' High School, then located in what became the Cranmer Centre. Both girls had debilitating illnesses as children – Parker osteomyelitis and Hulme tuberculosis – and they initially bonded over it. According to Parker's accounts, she and Hulme both romanticized the idea of being sick.

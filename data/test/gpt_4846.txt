The Freedom Rides Museum is located at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. The museum is dedicated to the memory of the sixty-six African Americans who volunteered to ride on the Greyhound buses from Jackson, Mississippi to Washington, D.C. in May of 1961 in an attempt to desegregate the bus system.  The Freedom Rides Museum is a repository of artifacts and memorabilia associated with the historic "Freedom Ride" of 1961. The exhibit contains artifacts from the buses that took part in the journey, as well as photographs, newspaper articles, and other memorabilia. The museum also features a 20-foot-tall Freedom Rider statue, which was erected in 1998 in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the historic journey.

The Finnish Democratic Republic ( or Suomen kansantasavalta, , Russian: Финляндская Демократическая Республика), also known as the Terijoki Government , was a short-lived puppet state of the Soviet Union in Finland from December 1939 to March 1940. The Finnish Democratic Republic was established by Joseph Stalin upon outbreak of the Winter War and headed by Otto Wille Kuusinen to govern Finland after Soviet conquest. The Finnish Democratic Republic was only recognised by the Soviet Union and nominally operated in Soviet-occupied areas of Finnish Karelia from the de facto capital of Terijoki. The Finnish Democratic Republic was portrayed by the Soviet Union as the official socialist government of Finland capable of restoring peace, but lost favor as the Soviets sought rapprochement with the Finnish Government. The Finnish Democratic Republic was dissolved upon signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty ending the Winter War and merged into the government of the Karelo-Finnish SSR.

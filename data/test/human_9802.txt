Pseudopfiesteria shumwayae (formerly placed in the genus Pfiesteria; see 'Taxonomy' section below) is a species of heterotrophic dinoflagellates in the genus Pseudopfiesteria. It was first characterized in North Carolina in 2000. It can acquire the ability for photosynthesis through eating green algae and retaining their chloroplasts. It can also turn predatory and toxic. Strains of Pseudopfiesteria shumwayae have been implicated in fish kills around the US east coast. Pseudopfiesteria shumwayae has been described as having a less complex life cycle than Pfiesteria piscicida. Toxicity While toxic strains of Pseudopfiesteria shumwayae have been implicated in fish kills, its ability to secrete an exotoxin to kill its prey has been subject to controversy. A study published in 2002 has shown that it is capable of killing fish by direct contact and feeding on their skin through micropredation. Toxicity levels appear to depend on the strains and assays used in the laboratory. Pfiesteria shumwayae toxin present in filtered water can cause cognitive deficits in rats.

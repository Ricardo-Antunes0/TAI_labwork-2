"No Can Do" is a song by American rock band Aerosmith. Written by frontman Steven Tyler and produced by Tyler and Joe Perry, it was released as the lead single from their eleventh studio album, Rocks (2011).  The song was written during the sessions for Rocks, and is a hard-rocking ballad about not being able to fix what's wrong in a relationship. "No Can Do" is also a tribute to Tyler's late friend and former bandmate, Randy Van Warmer.  "No Can Do" received mixed reviews from music critics. Some praised the song's energy and Tyler's vocal performance, while others found it unoriginal and too similar to other Aerosmith songs. However, the song reached number 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and became Aerosmith's ninth single to reach the top 10 in that country. It also reached the top five in Australia and New Zealand.

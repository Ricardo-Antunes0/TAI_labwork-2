Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is a pneumococcal vaccine consisting of two or more types of pneumococcal polysaccharide antigens attached to a protein carrier. The vaccine is given as an injection in the arm.  Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are effective in preventing pneumococcal pneumonia, which is the most common type of pneumonia and the leading cause of death from pneumonia. The vaccine has also been shown to be effective in preventing otitis media, meningitis, and sepsis caused by pneumococcal bacteria. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are recommended for people aged 65 years or older, people with chronic medical conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, or heart disease, and children aged 2 to 5 years.  The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is made of two or more types of pneumococcal polysaccharide antigens attached to a protein carrier. The polysaccharides are taken from the surface of certain types of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. These polysaccharides have been shown to bind to specific receptors on the surface of human cells and trigger the release of chemicals that damage the cell. The protein carrier helps to form a stable vaccine.  The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is given as an injection in the arm. It is available in both a monovalent (type 5) and bivalent (types 19A and 19F) form. The monovalent form is usually given

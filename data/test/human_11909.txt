Karadag Nature Reserve  is a protected nature reserve that covers a portion of the southeast coast of the Crimean peninsula. Encompassing mountains, forest-steppe, shoreline and marine areas, Karadag is an area of high biodiversity and the subject of much scientific study throughout the past 100 years. It supports a high number of Crimea's endemic species, and important bird colonies. The reserve is 36 km southwest of the city of Feodosia, and is currently administered by the Russian Academy of Sciences. Topography The Karadag Reserve is located in on the southeast coast of the Crimean Peninsula, in the Black Sea, on the eastern tip of the Crimean Mountains. The site is built on the Kara Dag Mountain, a volcanic massif that formed in the Jurassic. The southern shores of the mountains slope down to the sea, creating an 8 km shoreline of bays, beaches, and grottoes. 809 hectares of the site covers off-shore marine areas. The marine sector plus the pebble-boulder beach and the coastal cliffs up to 120 meters, are a Ramsar wetland of international importance. The reserve is bracketed by the coastal towns of Koktebel on the north, and Kurortne to the south.

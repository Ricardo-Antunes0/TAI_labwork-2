Morgan Tuck (born April 30, 1994) is an American former professional basketball player. She played her first four WNBA seasons with the Connecticut Sun. She won 4 consecutive NCAA championships with the University of Connecticut. She completed her high school career at Bolingbrook High School in Bolingbrook, Illinois. She played on the USA Basketball U17, U18 and U19 teams, where she helped each team win a gold medal. Early years Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Tuck played from an early age, but didn't think she was very good at it. She got better, and was good enough to earn a roster spot on the USA U16 team, although a knee injury prevented her from competing as a part of that team. Her high school teams had a combined record of 83–7 in her first three seasons, each of which culminated in a state championship. She was named Freshman of the Year by ESPN Rise in 2009, as well as Sophomore of the Year in 2010. Her senior year, the team had a record of 27–2, reaching the supersectionals, and failing to win the state title for the first time in her career. She averaged 27.7 points and 10.2 rebounds per game as a senior. She earned the title of Ms. Basketball for the state of Illinois twice, once as a freshman and again as a senior. Only two other players had won the award twice at that time: Cappie Pondexter and Candace Parker.

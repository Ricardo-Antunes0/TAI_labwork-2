Gliomastix murorum is one of four species of fungus in the genus Gliomastix. G. murorum is a type of saprophyte. One of the techniques that is used to isolate this fungus is through dilution plate. History and taxonomy In the past, there have been some confusions regarding which genus G. murorum should be part of. Over the years, Names of G. murorum have changed numerous times. In 1905, in order to accommodate species, Torula chartarum Corda, Gueguen erected form-genus Gliomastix. At first, G. chartarum and T. chartarum, a same fungus as T. convoluta, were thought to be two different fungi. However, Mason concluded G. chartarum is synonymous to G. convoluta, which is the same fungus as the T. convoluta. and Hughes and Dickinson eventually listed all of them as a species called G. murorum and listed them to be synonymous to one another. The proposal stating Gliomastix is the same genus as Acremonium was not accepted. Also, placing G. murorum into form-genus Sagrahamala was not accepted.

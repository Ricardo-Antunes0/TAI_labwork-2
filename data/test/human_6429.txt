Marketing engineering is currently defined as "a systematic approach to harness data and knowledge to drive effective marketing decision making and implementation through a technology-enabled and model-supported decision process". History The term marketing engineering can be traced back to Lilien et al. in "The Age of Marketing Engineering" published in 1998; in this article the authors define marketing engineering as the use of computer decision models for making marketing decisions. Marketing managers typically use "conceptual marketing", that is they develop a mental model of the decision situation based on past experience, intuition and reasoning. That approach has its limitations though: experience is unique to every individual, there is no objective way of choosing between the best judgments of multiple individuals in such a situation and furthermore judgment can be influenced by the person position in the firm's hierarchy. In the same year Lilien G. L. and A. Rangaswamy published Marketing Engineering: Computer-Assisted Marketing Analysis and Planning, Fildes and Ventura praised the book in their review, while noting that a fuller discussion of market share models and econometric models would have made the book better for teaching and that "conceptual marketing" should not be discarded in the presence of marketing engineering, but that both approaches should be used together. Leeflang and Wittink (2000) have identified five era of model building in marketing:  (1950-1965) The first era of application of operations research and management science to marketing  (1965-1970) Adaptation of models to fit marketing problems  (1970-1985) Emphasis on models that are an acceptable representation of reality and are easy to use  (1985-2000) Increase interest in marketing decision support systems, meta-analyses and studies of the generalizability of results  (2000- .  ) Growth of new exchange systems (ex: e-commerce) and need for new modeling approaches

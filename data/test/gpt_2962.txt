The Marshall Plan (officially the European Recovery Program) was a proposed American economic recovery program, proposed by U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall in 1947, to help rebuild Europe after World War II.  The plan was first proposed to the United Kingdom, which was the largest contributor to the Allied war effort, in March 1947. It was subsequently presented to the United States Congress, where it was passed as the Marshall Plan on July 8, 1947. The plan proceeded to be implemented by the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Poland and France over a period of four years.  The purpose of the plan was twofold: to aid European reconstruction and to prevent another world war. The program helped to provide financial assistance to Europe and made available surplus American goods that could be sold in Europe at lower prices than could be obtained there otherwise. The Marshall Plan also helped to promote European integration by providing financial support for political and economic reform in Europe. The goal of the plan was achieved in 1949; however, its effects continued into the 1950s and 1960s.  The program has been widely praised as an important step in the rebuilding of post-war Europe and as one of the key factors that led to the eventual stability of the continent. It has also been criticized for its high cost and its reliance on U.S. military presence in Europe after the Cold War ended. The Marshall Plan is frequently cited as one of the major factors contributing to the economic recovery of Western Europe following World War II.

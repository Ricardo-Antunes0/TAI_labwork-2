Humayun Azad (born Humayun Kabir; 28 April 1879 â€“ 10 October 1948) was an Indian independence activist, lawyer and political leader. He was the first president of the Indian National Congress, serving from 1921 to 1925. Azad is considered one of the most outstanding figures in Indian history, and is also honoured with a commemorative postage stamp.  Humayun Azad was born in a Punjabi Muslim family in the town of Nankana Sahib, British India (now in Pakistan). He grew up in a period of great turmoil and change, as India underwent its first major period of independence. Azad was educated at Punjab University, where he became involved in student politics. In 1905, he married Jahanara Begum, with whom he had two children.  Azad's political career began when he was elected to the Punjab Legislative Assembly in 1907. He served as Minister of Education in the government of Mahatma Gandhi from 1917 to 1919. In 1920, Azad was elected president of the Indian National Congress (INC), becoming one of the youngest people ever to hold that position. He presided over the INC during its most successful period, as it emerged as the leading political party in India. In 1922, Azad led the INC's campaign for independence from British rule. The following year, he was imprisoned along with Gandhi for their roles in the Rowlatt Act riots. After their release, Azad and Gandhi worked together to rebuild the INC after its losses in the ensuing elections.  Az

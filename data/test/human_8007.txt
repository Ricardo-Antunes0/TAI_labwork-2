Dudleya brevifolia, is a rare succulent plant known by the common name short-leaved liveforever, short-leaved dudleya or rarely the Del Mar Hasseanthus. It is an edaphic endemic that only grows on the mesas of the most ancient marine terraces, hiding in the vicinity of ironstone concretions. The leaves are deciduous, and disappear after the inflorescence develops. When flowering, it has a conspicuous white flower, which is in the shape of a star with a yellow center. After flowering, any above-ground trace of the plant will disappear, and it survives under the earth with a starch-rich subterranean caudex. It is only found on a strip of coast in San Diego County, California. It was formerly a subspecies of the similar Dudleya blochmaniae, and was not regarded as distinct enough to be worthy of species-status because both plants grew and hybridized together. However, the rapid urbanization of San Diego led to the destruction of a vast majority of the populations of these plants, with habitats razed to become office parks and suburbs. With the intermediate populations destroyed, it was elevated to species status. Today, it only exists in 5 locations in the world, in an area roughly 8 square miles centered around Torrey Pines State Park. It is of conservation concern, as the populations have become fragmented from each other and are threatened by continued disturbance and destruction.

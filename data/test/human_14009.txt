The Gorilla Project refers to a former plan for construction of the first major oil refinery in the United States in over 30 years. In 2008, Hyperion Resources Inc., a Dallas-based energy company, had considered placing the ,  capacity refinery near Elk Point, South Dakota and approximately  away from Vermillion, among three other potential locations. Construction was originally intended to begin in 2008, but was progressively delayed.  The state construction permit expired on March 15, 2013. The facility, which would process  of oil a day and use  of water daily from the Missouri River, caused significant controversy among concerned residents of Elk Point and the surrounding area. Prior to the announcement, the project and the company behind it were kept under considerable secrecy. It was known only as "Project Gorilla" while real estate agents made several purchase agreements on land north and east of Elk Point. Jeff Martin, a newspaper editor at the Argus Leader in Sioux Falls, uncovered two domain names, hyperionelkpoint.com and hyperionsd.com, which led to a news story that identified Hyperion for the first time. Elk Point is the forerunner among three other out-of-state locations Hyperion is considering for the refinery.

Antonio Manuel Lima Dias (February 22, 1944 – August 1, 2018), commonly known as Antonio Dias, was a Brazilian artist and graphic designer. He was a prominent figure during the concretist and Tropicália movements. Biography Dias and his family moved from Campina Grande to Rio Janeiro in 1957. Here he began working as a graphic designer, experimenting with art in his free time. During the 1960s, Dias became a frequent visitor of the artist Oswaldo Goeldi's studio at the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes. He first worked with abstract geometrical sculptures, but later moved to paper and canvas. After having won the 1965 Biennale des Jeunes painting award in Paris, Dias moved to Paris in 1967. When he was denied an extension of his French papers in May 1968, he moved to Milan, Italy. Several visual artists were hired as his assistants, including Marcos Chaves (1961-). He lived in Milan until his death in 2018.

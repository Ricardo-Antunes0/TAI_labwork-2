The film was released by The Asylum on July 5, 2016. In the tradition of The Asylum's catalog, Ghosthunters is a mockbuster of the 2016 film reboot ''Ghostbusters. Plot  A group of paranormal investigators, Neal, Henry, Jessica, Neal's girlfriend Amy, and Jessica's girlfriend Devon, have arrived at a house where Henry's wife and daughter were murdered by a serial killer known only as the Night Stalker. The team hopes to free the pair's souls via a device created by Neal, which can capture ghosts and seal them in containers. As the investigation proceeds Devon leaves and is killed by a floating knife while another Amy experiences a series of visions. These visions not only show her the deaths of Henry's wife and daughter, but also reveal that Henry is the Night Stalker. Henry had murdered them as part of a paranormal experiment, in the hopes that their extreme distress would amplify paranormal energy. Amy manages to get a recording of Henry confessing to the murders, an action that ends with Henry shooting Neal with a gun he was carrying with him. Amy and Jessica flee, but are caught by Henry. They are almost shot, but are spared when the ghost of Henry's wife appears and distracts him long enough for Jessica to break the containers of ectoplasm. The now released ghosts attack Henry, killing him and giving Amy and Jessica a chance to escape - only for Jessica to get shot and die. The film ends with Amy, the sole survivor of the night's events, leaving the house as police arrive.

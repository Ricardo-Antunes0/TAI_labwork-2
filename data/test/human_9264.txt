Fannin, Mississippi is a rural community located in northwest Rankin County, near the cities of Brandon and Jackson, loosely bordered by the Pearl River (presently the Ross Barnett Reservoir following impoundment) and Pelahatchie Creek. Originally occupied by Native Americans, the eventual settlement became a thriving agricultural-based town post Civil War, through first half of the twentieth century. The decline of the railroads, the impoundment of the Pearl River, and the general migration of settlers toward nearby cities led to Fannin's eventual dis-incorporation and transition into a mostly rural residential community (though a few small businesses remain). Early history and settlement The area comprising eventual Fannin was originally inhabited by Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes. Following Mississippi being granted statehood in 1817- as well as the expulsion of local Indian tribes to Oklahoma- early settlers from the Carolinas claimed available land grants in the 1830s. The first settlers of Fannin were drawn to the area largely due to the abundance of grazing land, timber resources, and natural springs. These handful of early settler further sub-divided their land holdings to other settlers over a roughly 60 year period, resulting in moderate population growth, and the establishment of thriving timber and agricultural industries by 1900.

The Queer Lounge is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that establishes hospitality suites at the top film festivals in the world.  Its primary function is to provide information and to educate those attending the film festival about the films with gay content (storylines, plots or characters) or created by gay filmmakers. They do this by creating an upscale hospitality suite and event space during the film festival where anyone, gay or straight, can stop by and learn about the films.  They hold press conferences and panel discussions in their space for films they support. The space is one of the few truly public spaces during a film festival without being invite only.  At night, the space becomes a top venue for film premiere and VIP parties- especially at the Sundance Film Festival.  However, they do also host gay centric events including parties known as Glamdance and Homos Away From Home.

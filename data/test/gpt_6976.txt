The City Island Bridge is a bridge that spans the Harlem River in New York City. It connects the neighborhoods of Manhattan and the Bronx. The bridge is nicknamed the "Tunnel of Love" because of its romantic appearance from certain angles. It is also known as the "Bronx-Manhattan Bridge" because it connects two of the most populous boroughs in New York City.  The bridge was designed by George W. Kelham and opened on October 1, 1928. It is composed of two reinforced concrete spans, each measuring 4,000 feet (1,219 meters) long, with a deck width of 80 feet (24 meters). The cost of construction was $4 million.  The City Island Bridge has been designated a National Historic Landmark.

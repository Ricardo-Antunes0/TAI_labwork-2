Wood Mill was a mill located by the River Tame in Stockport, Cheshire. Originally built in the early to mid 19th century and used as a bone mill. After 1848 the building was converted to a woollen mill and was rebuilt in 1864. In the 1930s, the building was used for colour and chemical manufacturing and demolished in 1964. The remains of the building are located on the bend of Lambeth Grove, Woodley between Wellington Works (occupied by Morrells Woodfinishes) and Riverside Kennels. History  In 1841, Wood Mill was owned by William Vaudrey and used as a bone mill, the final product of which was used to fertilise local land. Originally the mill was water powered using a fast flowing stream, running from Werneth Low, that ran alongside the building. There was also a water reservoir (mill dam) situated south of the building to increase the head of water available for the water wheel.

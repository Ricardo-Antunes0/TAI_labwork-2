Carl Ferdinand Degen (1 November 1766 – 29 July 1831) was a German botanist and mycologist.  Degen was born in Halle an der Saale. He studied medicine and botany at the University of Jena, where he became a doctor in 1793. He then worked as a doctor in Würzburg, Strasbourg and Mannheim, before becoming the director of the Botanical Garden in Trier in 1812. In 1816 he became a professor of botany at the University of Heidelberg, where he died in 1831.  Degen is most famous for his work on fungi, which he published in several volumes between 1811 and 1830. His mycological work included descriptions of new taxa and revisions of existing ones.

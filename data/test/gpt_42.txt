The Slovak National Party (, SNS) is a right-wing populist political party in Slovakia.  The Slovak National Party was founded on 7 October 2016, a few days after the country's presidential election, in which incumbent President Andrej Kiska lost to rival Smer-SD candidate Robert Fico. The SNS received 0.5% of the national vote and no seats in the parliament.  The party's founders, mostly former members of the far-right Slovak National Party (SNS) which was banned in 2009, claimed that their new party was not neo-fascist, but rather patriotic and pro-European.

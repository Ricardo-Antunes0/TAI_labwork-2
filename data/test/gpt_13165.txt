Operation Pipe Dreams was an American nationwide law enforcement operation that took place from September 1st to October 10th, 2006. The operation was conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in cooperation with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and other federal, state, and local partners. The goal of the operation was to dismantle a nationwide drug trafficking organization that was trafficking methamphetamine into the United States from Mexico.  Operation Pipe Dreams began on September 1st, 2006, when FBI agents deployed undercover into seven different Arizona cities to purchase methamphetamine. Over the next six weeks, agents purchased an estimated 210 pounds of meth from various drug dealers throughout the state. On October 10th, 2006, law enforcement officials executed a series of coordinated raids across seven different states – California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Texas, New Mexico and Colorado – resulting in the arrest of over 60 individuals and the seizure of an estimated $50 million worth of meth.

Howard Frank Mosher (June 2, 1942 â€“ January 29, 2017) was an American author of thirteen books: eleven fiction and two non-fiction.  Much of his fiction takes place in the mid-20th century and all of it is set in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont, a region loosely defined by the three counties in the northeastern corner of the state (Essex, Orleans, and Caledonia).  His characters are often quirky, reflecting the distinctive peculiarities of the region's taciturn residents.  The community struggle with changing times is often a theme, with the more traditional ways of rural Yankee life coming in conflict with an expanding, modern society.  The last novel published during his lifetime was God's Kingdom (St. Martin's Press, October 2015). Personal life Mosher graduated from Cato-Meridian Central School, in Cato, New York, in 1960 and graduated from Syracuse University in 1964.  He taught English at Orleans High and Lake Region Union High School during his early years.

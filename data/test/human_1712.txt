Lander County is a county in the U.S. state of Nevada. As of the 2010 census, the population was 5,775. Its county seat is Battle Mountain. History Lander County was created in 1862. It was one of the original 11 counties of Nevada when statehood was granted in 1864. It was named for Frederick W. Lander, chief engineer of a federal wagon route through the area in 1857. He later served as Special Indian Agent in the area, and died during the Civil War in Virginia in 1862 at the rank of brigadier general. Created in 1862, Lander County sprang forth as the result of a mining boom on the Reese River, along the old pony express line; taking a considerable portion of Churchill and Humboldt counties with it. Eventually, Lander County would be known as the "mother of counties" since three other counties in Nevada were formed from it: Elko, White Pine, and Eureka. Its first county seat was Jacob's Spring in 1862 which was soon after moved to Austin in 1863 and finally Battle Mountain in 1979.

Vincenzo Pirrotta (born 1942) is a biologist who has worked extensively on the study of chromosome replication. Pirrotta's research has had a significant impact on our understanding of how chromosomes are replicated during cell division, and has led to the development of novel methods for diagnosing and treating chromosome disorders.  Pirrotta was born in 1942 in Rome, Italy. He received his medical degree from the University of Rome in 1966, and completed his postgraduate training at the University of Milan in 1972. He began his career as a researcher at the National Institute of Genetics in Rome, where he worked on the study of chromosome replication. In 1984, he moved to the University of California, Davis, where he served as the director of the university's Center for chromosomal research. He retired from Davis in 2001, and currently resides in Italy.  Pirrotta's research has had a significant impact on our understanding of how chromosomes are replicated during cell division. His work has led to the development of novel methods for diagnosing and treating chromosome disorders. His work is also notable for its contributions to the field of molecular biology. Pirrotta is a member of numerous professional organizations, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the European Molecular Biology Organization. He has received numerous awards and honors, including the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research (1994), the Gairdner Foundation International Award (1998), and the Italian National Prize for Scientific Research (2002).

Now's the Time! is the nineteenth album by Canadian rock band Rush, released in 1978.  The album was recorded at Toronto's Record Plant between April and July 1978 and produced by Rush themselves. It is the first album with drummer Neil Peart, after he replaced John Rutsey.  "Now's the Time!" is Rush's most experimental album, featuring a more progressive sound than their previous work. The lyrics are often dark and introspective, dealing with themes of disillusionment and physical and mental illness. The album reached number 8 on the Billboard 200 chart, but did not receive as much commercial success as their previous albums.  "Now's the Time!" has been cited by some fans and writers as Rush's best album. It has been re-released several times over the years, including a remastered edition in 2000 that restored the original mixes.

Fungi from Yuggoth is a sequence of short stories by American author H.P. Lovecraft, written between 1931 and 1934. The stories are set in the fictional town of Innsmouth and its environs, and concern the interactions of humans and fungi.  Lovecraft's use of fungi in his writing predates the discovery of fungal spores as a means of propagation by over a decade. In "Fungi from Yuggoth", he uses fungi to explore themes such as the nature of life, knowledge, and the power of imagination.  The stories were first published in two parts in the amateur magazine The Spectrum in 1931 and 1932, and were later collected in a single volume under the title Fungi from Yuggoth. They have been frequently reprinted since then, most recently in an edition published by Arkham House in 2007.

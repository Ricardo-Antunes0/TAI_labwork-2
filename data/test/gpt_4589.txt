The Adelaide Steamship Company was an Australian shipping company that operated in the early 20th century.  The Adelaide Steamship Company was founded in 1901 by a group of businessmen led by Murray Nicol. The company operated a fleet of ships that transported goods throughout Australia and internationally. The company was a major player in the Australian shipping industry and was responsible for transporting goods such as wheat, wool, coal, and iron ore.  The Adelaide Steamship Company ceased operations in 1931 after the Great Depression caused by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 led to a decline in shipping activity. The company is remembered today for its role in the development of Australian shipping and for its contributions to the economy of Australia.

Where's Your Cup? is an album by Henry Threadgill released on the Columbia label in 1996.  The album features seven of Threadgill's compositions performed by Threadgill's Make a Move band - Brandon Ross, Tony Cedras, Stomu Takeishi, and J.T. Lewis. Reception The Allmusic review by John Uhl awarded the album 4 stars, stating, "Even though Henry Threadgill is often considered "difficult to listen to," most blindfolded listeners would probably find themselves identifying any randomly selected 20-second segment of Where's Your Cup as something a little more mainstream... Such is the elusiveness of Threadgill's a-bit-of-everything approach to modern jazz, a style-collage sound he achieves here with a lot of help from his band, Make a Move... But give the credit of assembling these varied and sundry elements into a consistent product to Threadgill. Where's My Cup has its highly organized moments as well, which possess the same spaced-out mysteriousness as all the clamoring jam-out uproar".

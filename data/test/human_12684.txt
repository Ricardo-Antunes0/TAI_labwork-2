Juan de Canaveris (or Canaverys) (1748 – 1822) was an Piedmontese lawyer and politician, who served during the viceroyalty of Río de la Plata as accounting officer in the Tribunal de Cuentas de Buenos Aires. He had achieved a high social status in the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, where he supported the revolutionary movements of May, being the only neighbor (founding fathers of Argentina) of Italian origin who attended in the Open Cabildo, of May 22, 1810. Juan Canaverys also had an active participation in the Hermandad de la Santa Caridad, the first charitable society of Buenos Aires. He was the founder of the family of that last name in Buenos Aires, connected in turn with the main Argentine families of the colonial and post colonial period of Argentina and Uruguay, and the direct ancestor of prominent military, revolutionaries, lawyers, notaries, politicians and priests of Buenos Aires. He had a long career in Buenos Aires, serving as attorney-in-fact of Francisco Maciel and Victorián de Villava. In 1798 he was appointed as representative of the City Council of Santiago del Estero. During the May Revolution he integrated the sector proposed by Pascual Ruiz Huidobro and Feliciano Chiclana, political group that proposed the destitution of the Viceroy and the assumption of the government by the Cabildo de Buenos Aires, in form of a provisional government.

Delivery Dudes is a Florida-based on-demand delivery service founded in 2009 by Jayson Koss. A investor-backed company, Delivery Dudes uses logistics services for delivery of restaurant food, groceries, and prescriptions.''' History  Delivery Dudes was founded as Delray Delivery Dudes in Delray Beach, Florida. After a slow start, the company gained pace in 2012. It expanded to 70 cities in South Florida, Colorado, Tennessee, Oregon and Pennsylvania. As of 2020, Delivery Dudes services over 2000 restaurants in the country.   In October 2015, the company introduced Dudes Liquor service to deliver alcoholic beverages and other supplies.   Amid COVID-19 pandemic, Delivery Dudes launched Dudes Bodega, a no-contact service to help people by picking-up and delivering groceries, prescriptions and other supplies at home. The service is operational only in Florida.   In March 2021, Delivery Dudes agreed to sell its assets to Louisiana-based online restaurant pickup and delivery platform Waitr Holdings (WTRH: Nasdaq) for about $23 million in stock and cash. Waitr CEO Carl Grimstad said Delivery Dudes' brand recognition will accelerate its own growth in the Florida delivery marketplace.

The Caproni Trento F.5 was a small, fast, and maneuverable fighter aircraft of the 1920s. The Trento was designed to replace the aging Caproni Ca.5 and Ca.7 fighters in the Italian air force.  The Trento was a conventional single-seat fighter of mixed construction, with a wooden frame covered in fabric. It was powered by a single BMW VI engine, providing a top speed of 354 km/h (220 mph). The Trento had a reasonably sophisticated armament, including two 7.7 mm (.303 in) machine guns and two 0.5 in (12.7 mm) cannon.

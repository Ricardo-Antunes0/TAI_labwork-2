Alexiares and Anicetus (Ἀλεξιάρης Alexiarês and Ανικητος Anikêtos) were two of the most important early Christian missionaries in Anatolia.  Born in the late 1st century AD, Alexiares was a pagan priest in the city of Ephesus. He became a Christian after his conversion and was baptized by the apostle Paul. He travelled throughout Anatolia proselytizing Christianity and converting many people to the new faith.   Anicetus, also born in Ephesus, was a Christian who had been baptized by Paul. He served as the second bishop of Smyrna after Paul's death. Anicetus was martyred during the Persecution of Christians under Roman emperor Nero in 68 AD.

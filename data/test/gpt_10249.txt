In mathematics, a vector bundle is a bundle of vectors in a mathematical space.  A vector bundle is a generalization of the notion of a vector space. In a vector space, every vector has a unique direction and every point is associated with a unique vector. In contrast, a vector bundle is not necessarily directed; it may be unordered and any two points in the bundle may not be associated with the same vector. Additionally, a vector bundle does not necessarily have a single dimension; it can have any number of dimensions.  Vector bundles are important in many fields of mathematics, including differential geometry, topology, algebra, and curve theory. They are also used in computer graphics and engineering to model physical objects and structures.

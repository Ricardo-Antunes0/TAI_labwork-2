Hildigund Neubert (born Hildigund  Falcke) is the daughter of an East German Pastor-Theologian who became a professional musician.   As the pressures for change in the one-party dictatorship intensified, thanks both to the bankruptcy of the state and to the winds of Glasnost blowing across from, of all places, Moscow, she found herself drawn by circumstances into politics.   At the time of East Germany's "peaceful revolution" she was in East Berlin, a permanent presence at the control centre of Demokratischer Aufbruch ("Democratic Awakening" / DA).   A feature of those months was the dispersed character of the uprisings that destroyed the dictatorship:  it is misleading to think in terms of any sort of central "guiding hand" controlling developments.   Nevertheless, DA was one of a number of movements and organisations that became key to focusing the energies of (by the end of 1989) hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy campaigners and demonstrators, in ways that led, in March 1990, to the only free and fair parliamentary election in the history of the "German Democratic Republic" and thereafter, more indirectly, to reunification in October 1990. After reunification she remained active on the centre-right of German politics, though never as a conventional mainstream "Union" politician.

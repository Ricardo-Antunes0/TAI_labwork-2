Bernardino Verro (; July 3, 1866 â€“ February 15, 1934) was an Italian painter, sculptor, and architect.  Verro was born in Faenza, the son of a sculptor. He moved to Rome in 1885 to study at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma. He exhibited at the Universal Exposition of 1900 and 1906. Verro is best known for his depictions of ancient Roman sculpture, which he saw firsthand while working as an apprentice restorer in the Vatican Museums.  Verro worked in a Divisionist style, using broad brushstrokes to create a sense of depth and vibrancy. He is also noted for his brightly colored abstracts and landscapes. Verro died in Rome at the age of 71.

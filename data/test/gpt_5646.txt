Sulfurimonas is a bacterial genus within the family of Proteobacteria.  Sulfurimonas are Gram-negative, rod-shaped, motile bacteria which can be found in a variety of environments, including fresh water, soil, and salt water. They are capable of metabolizing a variety of organic compounds, including ammonia and sulfides. As a result, sulfurimonas are important contributors to the production of sulfur dioxide and sulfates.  Members of the sulfurimonas genus are capable of causing a number of diseases in humans and other animals. For example, Sulfurimonas solfataricus is a causative agent of black pigmentation in the skin known as melanoma, while Sulfurimonas thorellii is responsible for thoriosepsis, a syndrome characterized by fluid accumulation in the intestine.

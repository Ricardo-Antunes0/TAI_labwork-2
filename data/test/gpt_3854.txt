John Glover Stone (November 16, 1876 – September 26, 1949) was an American economist who is best known for his work on monetary theory and the theory of business cycles.  Stone was born in Northampton, Massachusetts, on November 16, 1876. He attended Harvard University, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1898 and his Ph.D. in 1903. After graduation, Stone taught at the University of Wisconsin and Princeton University before joining the faculty of the University of Chicago in 1907. He became a full professor at Chicago in 1916 and remained there until his retirement in 1946.  Stone's work on monetary theory and the theory of business cycles is considered classic economics. His book, Money and Credit (1917), was one of the first books to introduce the concepts of rational expectations and modern macroeconomic theory to a broad audience. He also wrote extensively on economic policy and served as president of the American Economic Association (1927–28). Stone died on September 26, 1949, in Evanston, Illinois.

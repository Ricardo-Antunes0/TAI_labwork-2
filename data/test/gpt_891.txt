Sabit Damolla (; ; June 1883 â€“ August 27, 1938) was an Indian playback singer and actress who primarily worked in Hindi cinema. She was considered one of the most popular and successful playback singers of the era, and is often cited as the first female playback singer to achieve international success.  Damolla was born in a Muslim family in the town of Baroda in present-day Gujarat, India. She started her singing career in the early 1920s, when she was employed as a chorus girl in several films. Her first major break came in the 1934 film "Aurat" (English: "The Soul"), where she performed the song "Tumse Hi Sabse" (English: "This is True Love"). The song became a major hit and helped establish Damolla's reputation as one of India's leading playback singers.  Damolla continued to enjoy significant success throughout the 1930s and 1940s, recording dozens of popular songs for Hindi films. Among her most famous compositions are "Tere Bina" (English: "Our Two Lives"), from the 1936 film "Waqt"; "Dil Hai To Aisi" (English: "This is How I Want to Live"), from the 1937 film "Saucepan"; and "Tum Hi Ho" (English: "This is How I Feel"), from the 1948 film "Do Bigha Zamin". Damolla also acted in a few films during this period, most notably the 1939 film "Mera Naam Joker".

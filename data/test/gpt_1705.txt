Eight ships of the Royal Navy have been named Portland, after the port town of Portland, Dorset. The first HMS Portland was a 104-gun second rate ship of the line launched on 12 February 1794. She was wrecked off Cape St Vincent in 1805.  The latest HMS Portland, a Type 25 destroyer, was commissioned into the Royal Navy in September 2014.

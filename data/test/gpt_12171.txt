Swingin' Together is a 30-minute unsold television series pilot based on the true story of the New Orleans jazz greats the Big Three: Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Kay Thompson. The series was to be produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and written by Chad Hayes and Casey Wilson.  The show was set to tell the story of the big three's rise to fame and their struggles with racism and sexism in the early days of jazz. The pilot was shot largely in New Orleans in February and March 2013, but was not picked up to series.

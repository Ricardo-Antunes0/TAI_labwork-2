"Pay in Blood" is an uptempo rock song written and performed by Bob Dylan that appears as the fifth track on his 2012 studio album Tempest. Like much of Dylan's 21st-century output, he produced the song himself using the pseudonym Jack Frost. Composition and recording Dylan apparently wrote the lyrics of the song at some point in the first half of 2011. Dylan's friend and fellow songwriter Elvis Costello  recalled in an interview with The Guardian that Dylan had read him the lyrics at the West Coast Blues & Roots Festival in Fremantle, Australia where both men were performing in April 2011: "Dylan pulled out a narrow roll of paper from his jacket ('not unlike a London bus ticket'), unfurled it and proceeded to recite a new song scrawled upon it, 'Pay In Blood'. Each time the chorus line came around ('I pay in blood, but not my own') 'it was delivered with a different flourish: a swashbuckler’s panache, a black comical riposte, held with a steady gaze, tossed away with a wicked laugh or a ghost of a smile'”.

Partner-assisted reproduction, reception of oocytes from partner (ROPA), reciprocal IVF, shared motherhood, partner IVF or co-IVF is a method of family building that is used by couples who both possess female reproductive organs. The method uses in vitro fertilization (IVF), a method that means eggs are removed from the ovaries, fertilized in a laboratory, and then one or more of the resulting embryos are placed in the uterus to hopefully create a pregnancy. Reciprocal IVF differs from standard IVF in that two partners are involved: the eggs are taken from one partner, and the other partner carries the pregnancy. In this way, the process is mechanically identical to IVF with egg donation. Reciprocal IVF offers the highest chance for pregnancy and a lower risk of a multiple birth. Using this process ensures that each partner is a biological parent of the child. This fertility process is one way that allows lesbian and trans male couples to reproduce and both be involved in the physical process of becoming pregnant. This process was first introduced in Spain in 2007 at the CEFER institute.

Freda Nkirote Mâ€™Mbogori is a Kenyan archaeologist, who is Director of the British Institute in Eastern Africa (BIEA) and President of the Pan-African Archaeological Association. Biography  Nkirote studied for her BA at the University of Nairobi, for her MA at the University of Bergen and for her PhD at the University of Paris. She also holds a PG Diploma in Museum Studies from University College London, and a Field Research qualification from the University of Harvard. She is project lead, alongside Paul Lane, for the 'Well Being' project, funded by the British Academy, which is an academic research project working with pastoralist community organisations in Kenya and southern Ethiopia to understand historic water management practices. She was previously funded by the Wenner-Gren Foundation to research Bantu migration in the Mbeere region. She was also a project lead for the 'Rising from the Depths' scheme, where she investigated the role of women in maritime heritage preservation on the Kenyan coast. She has called for a change in angle on debates around cultural repatriation, arguing that the "tangible economic benefits" that countries whose cultural heritage is held overseas would gain from repatriation is equally significant to the "intangible negative effects" of loss of identity.

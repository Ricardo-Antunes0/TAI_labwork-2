Katherine "Katie" Blackburn (née Brown; born September 26, 1984) is an American former professional tennis player. She reached a career-high singles ranking of World No. 7 in September 2009. Blackburn also won two doubles titles at the WTA Tour, in April 2006 with her then-partner Vania King and in August 2008 with Ai Sugiyama.  Blackburn was born in Thousand Oaks, California, to parents Jeff and Alison Brown. She attended Thousand Oaks High School before going on to attend the University of Southern California (USC), where she played for the USC Trojans women's tennis team from 2002 to 2005.  Blackburn made her professional debut at the age of 17, and she reached her first WTA singles final at the 2005 Bank of the West Classic, where she lost to Martina Hingis. Her biggest success came in 2006, when she won her first doubles title at the Pacific Life Open with Vania King. The following year, Blackburn teamed up with Ai Sugiyama to win her second doubles title at the Toray Pan Pacific Open.  In 2008, Blackburn suffered a series of injuries which hampered her progress. She withdrew from her first three tournaments of the year – the Australian Open, Wimbledon and US Open – due to a back injury sustained in late 2007. However, she made a successful return to competition at the 2008 French Open, where she reached the quarterfinals as a qualifier. Her best result that year came at the Beijing Olympics, where she reached the semifinals

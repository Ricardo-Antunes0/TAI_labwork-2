Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress (RSC)  was a political party in India that was founded on 15 December 1984 by Mulayam Singh Yadav, the then-chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. The RSC was a breakaway faction of the Indian National Congress (INC) led by Mulayam Singh Yadav. The party contested the 1989 and 1996 state elections in Uttar Pradesh on a secular platform, but won only a few seats. In the 1998 general election, the RSC emerged as the largest party in Uttar Pradesh, with 137 of the 290 seats in the state legislature. However, it failed to form a government in Uttar Pradesh and its support was crucial to the victory of the INC-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the national level.  The RSC's support base was predominantly Muslim and Yadavs were a minority within the Muslim community. In 2002, the RSC merged with the Samajwadi Janata Party (SJP), an ideological ally, to form the Samajwadi Party (SP). The SP emerged as one of the major parties in Uttar Pradesh and also formed government in other states with Yadav support. In May 2017, following allegations of corruption against SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, the RSC dissolved its alliance with the SP and expelled Mulayam Singh from its ranks.

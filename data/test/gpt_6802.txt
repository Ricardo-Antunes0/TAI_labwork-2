Pearling or genital beading is a form of body modification in which small beads or other small objects are inserted into the genital or anorectal areas for decorative purposes. The practice is also sometimes called "marbling" or "beading". The beads are typically made of materials such as glass, plastic, metal, or seashells and can be colorful or metallic.  Pearling is most commonly performed on women, but it can also be performed on men. The popularity of pearling has increased in recent years, as the practice has become more visible and less taboo. Some people pearl as a form of self-expression, while others do it for aesthetic reasons. There is no clear consensus on the health benefits of pearling, although some people believe that it can improve sexual pleasure and circulation.  The origins of pearloring are unknown, but the practice may have originated in Africa or Southeast Asia. Pearling is now widespread in many parts of the world, including Asia, Europe, North America, and South America.

The Abraham Coult House is a historic house at 1695 Hebron Avenue in Glastonbury, Connecticut.  Built about 1706 and enlarged several times, it is a well-preserved colonial residence, exhibiting changing construction methods through its alterations.  Moved in the 1970s to avoid demolition and restored, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history The Abrahm Coult House is located in a rural-suburban area of central northern Glastonbury, on the north side of Hebron Road (Connecticut Route 94).  It is set well back from the road, down a  drive on over  of land, overlooking Salmon Brook.  It is a -story wood-frame structure, with a side-gable roof, central chimney, clapboarded exterior, and concrete block foundation.  Its main facade faces southwest, and is five bays wide, with a center entrance framed by Greek Revival pilasters and topped by a multilight transom window and corniced entablature.  The interior follows an early colonial central chimney plan, with a narrow entrance vestibule which also has a winding dogleg staircase.  There are parlors on either side of the chimney, and the kitchen extends across most of the rear.  Original 18th-century woodwork is retained in most of the chambers, but plasterwork and other surfaces have been replaced as part of a 1970s restoration.

East Bay Walls, also known as the San Francisco Bay Wall and the East Bay Barrier, is a 1,000-foot-long, 12-foot-high earthen and concrete wall that was built in the 1930s along the eastern shoreline of San Francisco Bay. The wall was designed to protect San Francisco from a possible invasion by Japan and was constructed at a cost of $50 million.  The East Bay Wall was intended to be an effective barrier against invasion by Japan and formed part of a larger strategic plan known as the Defense of the Bay Area. Construction of the wall began in 1935 and was completed in 1937. The wall was initially divided into four sections, with each section containing a number of forts, gun batteries, and observation towers. In 1940, the section between Oakland and Richmond was completed, and in 1941 the section between Richmond and San Pablo Bay was completed. The final section, between San Pablo Bay and the Pacific Ocean, was completed in 1945.  The East Bay Wall has been designated a National Historic Landmark and is currently managed by the National Park Service as part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The wall is open to visitors during daylight hours and can be accessed via a number of trails.

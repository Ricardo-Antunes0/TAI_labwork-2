Anaerobic corrosion (also known as hydrogen corrosion) is a process of metal corrosion that takes place in an environment lacking oxygen. Anaerobic corrosion is classified as a type III process, meaning that it occurs in the presence of oxygen but at a rate that is slower than the rate at which oxygen destroys the metal.  Anaerobic corrosion is most commonly seen in the presence of chloride ions, which are produced as a by-product of catalysis. Chloride ions cause metal to dissolve in water and form hydrochloric acid, which attacks the metal from the inside. This process can be accelerated by using acids or other oxidizing agents to break down the protective oxide layer on the metal.

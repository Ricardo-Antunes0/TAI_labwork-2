It ranks as one of the largest among the more than 200 professional services networks in the world. WSG members are independent law, accounting and investment banking firms. According to the organization's website , WSG was formed in 2002 as a multidisciplinary network comprising over 120 member firms in 150 jurisdictions and 23,000 professionals. Its global headquarters are located in the Houston, Texas, History Multidisciplinary professional services networks were an important phenomenon in the late 1990s and early part of 2000. The Big 4 accounting firms were creating their own multidisciplinary networks by acquiring legal departments. Their objective was to share fees with the lawyers in the network. The shear potential of these potentially massive networks threatened independent law firms and questioned the whether or not it was a violation of the rules of legal ethics prohibiting fee sharing with non-lawyers. After the fall of Enron, it became clear that a law firm controlled by an accounting firm and providing services to a common client contained an inherent conflict of interest. This led to the passage of Sarbanesâ€“Oxley effectively prohibiting accounting firms from providing legal services through a controlled law firm. However, independent law and accounting firms creating networks in which no facilities and client profits were shared remained permissible allowing a number of networks to take advantage of the availability of this exception for multidisciplinary networks. They included Alliott Group, MSI Global Alliance Morison International, the Geneva Group and World Services Group.

Oddi Helgason (c.1070/80 – c. 1140/50), called Oddi the Law-Giver, was an Icelandic chieftain and legislator.  He was born in Oddi in the south of Iceland, probably around 1070/80. He was the son of Helgi Hákonarson and a grandson of Ólafr Helgason, both important figures in early Icelandic history. Oddi had a brother, Ingólfr Hákonarson, who also became a prominent chieftain.  After being educated in English at the court of King William I of England (1087–1100), Oddi returned to Iceland in 1105 and soon became one of the most powerful men in the country. He was involved in many disputes over land and power, but he also became a highly respected lawmaker and judge. In 1115, he was appointed governor of Reykjavik and held this position for six years.  In 1128, Oddi was elected as one of the first two chieftains to represent Iceland at a national assembly called by King Sigurd I of Norway (1046–1130). This assembly was important in developing laws and institutions in Iceland and Oddi played an important role in its proceedings. He also served as an adviser to Sigurd during his reign as king of Norway (1128–1133).  Oddi died around 1140/50 and was buried at Hvítárvatn monastery on the island of Mýrd

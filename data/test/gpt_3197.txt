Hughenden Manor, Hughenden, Buckinghamshire  is a Grade I listed building, and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It is situated in the parish of Hughenden, 3 miles northwest of Amersham, and 5 miles north-northwest of High Wycombe.   The manor was probably built in the late 14th century by Sir John Fastolf, and may have been a fortified manor house on the site of an earlier settlement. The present house was built in the 17th century by Sir Thomas White and enlarged in the 19th century. The gardens were laid out by Capability Brown in the 18th century.  The manor house is now a private residence. The gardens are open to the public on Sunday afternoons from Easter to October.

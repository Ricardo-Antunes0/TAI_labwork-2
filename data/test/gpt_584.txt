HMS Calliope was a  light cruiser of the British Royal Navy. She was in service from 1914 to 1918.  Calliope was built by Denny, Brown and Co., Ltd., Dumbarton, Scotland, and commissioned in May 1914. She served on the Home Fleet until 1916, when she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet. Calliope took part in the Battle of Jutland as part of the 4th Cruiser Squadron and was hit by a shell that exploded in her engine room and killed or wounded most of her crew. She was towed back to England for repairs, which lasted until late 1917. In 1918 she returned to the Mediterranean Fleet and served through the end of World War I. Calliope was decommissioned in 1919 and sold for scrapping in 1922.

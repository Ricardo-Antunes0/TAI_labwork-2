Wu Weian (; born September 1, 1981) is a former Chinese professional football player. Club career Wu Weian started his career with second-tier club Guangdong Xiongying in 2002 where he established himself the following season as a team regular. However while he may have cemented himself within the team (now renaming itself Shenzhen Kejian at the start of the 2004 league season) he was unable to aid them in their promotion bid to the top tier. Tianjin Teda however were willing to take Wu Wei'an and with the chance to play in the Chinese Super League, Wu Wei'an transferred to Tianjin at the beginning of the 2005 league season. With this move Wu Wei'an would rise to prominence, quickly establishing himself as a regular within the team he would play in 26 league games and score 7 goals. The following seasons would see him become a vital member of the team that would qualify for the 2009 AFC Champions League for the first time in the club's history, while also going on to play in five games and scoring one goal during the tournament. He would then see the club become runners-up of the 2010 league season while also seeing Tianjin finish in the last sixteen of the 2011 AFC Champions League where he played in four games and scored one goal. Despite these achievement Wu Wei'an did not win any trophies until the 2011 Chinese FA Cup where he came on as a late substitute as Tianjin won the cup 2â€“1 against Shandong Luneng Taishan.

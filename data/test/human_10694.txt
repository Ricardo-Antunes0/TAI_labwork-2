The film won three Nandi Awards. Plot Appala Narsaiah (Gollapudi Maruthi Rao) is an ordinary middle-class man who makes a simple living as a Central Government clerk. His family, a typical South Indian joint family, includes his dutiful wife, Godavari (Annapurna), his oldest son Prakash (Sarath Babu), a junior officer at Indian Oil, and his wife Uma (Suhasini), his second son Raghava (Rajendra Prasad), a factory worker, his youngest son Kaali Dasu, a useless fellow who has failed his high school exams twice, and his daughter Sarojini (Kalpana). The modest income from his government job barely provides for his family's needs. His sons contribute some amounts in proportion to their incomes. The family gets by, but Appala Narsaiah worries about the future. Raghava and Sarojini are not yet married, and Kaali Dasu has a bleak future if he does not graduate high school. Sarojini is a particular worry; her beauty and charm are matched by her arrogance and contempt. She summarily rejects any marriage proposal, and her obstinate demeanor causes great concern to Appala Narsaih. He nonetheless plows on through life hoping for solutions to his difficulties.

The Eugene C. Eppley Foundation was founded in Omaha, Nebraska.  Founded by Omaha hotel magnate Eugene C. Eppley, the foundation was the leading benefactor for several charities and institutions in the Midwestern United States.  (This is not to be confused with the Eppley Foundation for Research, which primarily supports advanced postdoctoral research in the physical and biological sciences.  The latter was founded by Marion Eppley, and its offices are based in New York City.) About Beginning in 1949, the Eppley Foundation contributed to a variety of educational, healthcare and civic endeavors.  Eppley was a longtime friend of Dr. Milo Bail, the president of the Omaha University from 1948 until 1965.  During that time the Eppley Foundation gave more than $1.2 million to the university. After Eppley's passing, the Eppley Foundation donated another $50,000 to recruit distinguished professors. The Eppley Library (now the Administration building) at the University of Nebraska at Omaha was named in recognition of the Foundation's giving.

Guggenheim Museum in New York City, the Museum of Modern Art in Paris, and the Tate Gallery in London. Ballen was born in Kortrijk, Belgium and lives and works in Antwerp, Belgium.  Roger Ballen was born on April 11, 1950, in Kortrijk, Belgium. He studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Antwerp from 1967 to 1973, where he was awarded the prestigious Prix de Rome for sculpture. After his studies, Ballen lived in London for a time before moving to New York City in 1976. There he associated with the artists Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat and participated in their seminal street art movement.  Ballen's early work is often characterized by its spare formalism, which emphasizes the sculptural form of his pieces over their narrative or decorative elements. His later work has tended towards more overtly conceptual projects that explore themes of space and time, as well as the relationship between humanity and nature. His sculptures have been exhibited at institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. In 2012 he was awarded the Luxembourg Prize for Lifetime Achievement.

Ram Dass (born Richard Alpert; April 6, 1931 â€“ April 7, 1997) was an American spiritual teacher, author, and philosopher.  Ram Dass was born on April 6, 1931 in Boston, Massachusetts to middle-class Jewish parents. He had a difficult childhood, and developed a strong interest in Eastern religions by the age of twelve. After graduating from college with a degree in psychology, Ram Dass worked as a research psychologist at a psychiatric hospital in Massachusetts. He began to study meditation in the late 1950s and eventually became a devotee of the Transcendental Meditation program.  In the early 1970s, Ram Dass began to teach meditation to students at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1974, he published his first book, Be Here Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment. The book was successful and helped to popularize meditation among the general public.  Later in life, Ram Dass began to focus on his spiritual teachings. He published several books on the subject, including The Way of the Peaceful Warrior (1990), Dancing with Life (1992), and A Path With Heart (1994). Ram Dass died on April 7, 1997 after a short battle with cancer.

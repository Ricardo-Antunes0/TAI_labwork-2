Kaufman-Straus was a local department store that operated in the Bronx and Manhattan in the early 20th century.  The Kaufman-Straus Company was founded on July 29, 1899, by brothers Isaac and Louis Kaufman and their cousin Nathan Straus. The store opened in the Bronx on February 2, 1902, and in Manhattan on February 6, 1902. The company became a major player in the Bronx and Manhattan retail markets, with stores located on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan (1929), Union Square in Manhattan (1935), and at 3278 Broadway in the Bronx (1938). The company also operated a chain of department stores called Kaufmann's, which was headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1948, Kaufman-Straus was acquired by May Department Stores. In 1971, it was merged into Federated Department Stores.

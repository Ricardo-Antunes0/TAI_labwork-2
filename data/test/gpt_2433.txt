York Factory was a settlement and Hudson's Bay Company fur-trading post located in the Red River Settlement of what is now Manitoba, Canada.  The York Factory complex was the largest and most important British fur-trading post in North America from 1784 to 1869. It was located on the north bank of the Red River, about 16 km upstream from its confluence with the Assiniboine River. Named after the Earl of York, who was then the governor general of British North America, York Factory was the site of an early exploration by John Jacob Astor and his American partner, William McKenzie.  From its inception in 1784, York Factory served as a supply base for the fur trade on the upper Great Lakes and in the Rocky Mountains. Over time, it became an important trading post for beaver pelts, buffalo robes, and other commodities produced by the HBC's numerous European and Native American suppliers. In 1869, following Britain's transfer of ownership of Rupert's Land to Canada, York Factory became a Canadian Crown Corporation and ceased to function as a fur-trading post. Today, much of York Factory remains preserved as an historic site and tourist attraction.

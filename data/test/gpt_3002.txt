Possible Minds: Twenty-five Ways of Looking at the Mind is a book by the Canadian philosopher Daniel Dennett. It was first published in 1995.  The book explores the notion of possible minds, or ways of understanding the mind that do not rely on physicalism. It takes a philosophical perspective, examining different ways of understanding mental states and mental processes, including functionalism, eliminativism, dualism and panpsychism.

Orijin is a Nigerian alcoholic beverage produced by Diaego/Guinness Nigeria PLC. Sold in dark-green 65-centilitre glass bottles and marketed with an ABV of 6%, Orijin is similar to beer in appearance and strength. Unlike beer, the drink does not contain barley or hops, rather marketing itself as "a bittersweet blend with flavours of African herbs and fruit". Ingredients listed on the label include water, alcohol, sugar and plant extract (kola nut, prune, oakwood, bitter orange peel, wormwood). The resulting flavor is a bitter cocktail with hints of Citrus that give it a distinct medicinal taste. Anecdotally, many fans of the drink claim that the herbs that give the drink its distinctive flavor also act to prevent or counteract a hangover after a night of drinking. A stronger liqueur version of the drink, called Orijin bitters, is available in 20 cL and 75 cL sizes, with an ABV closer to 30%.

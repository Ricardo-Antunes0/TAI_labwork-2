Diarmait mac Tommaltaig (died 833) was a king of Connacht from the Uí Briúin branch of the Connachta. He was the great-grandson of Indrechtach mac Muiredaig Muillethan (died 723), a previous king. The death of his father Tommaltach mac Murgail (died 774) is recorded in the annals where he is called king of Mag nAi. He succeeded his brother Muirgius mac Tommaltaig (died 815). He was of the Síl Muiredaig sept of the Uí Briúin. He ruled from 815 to 833. His brother had been a successful king who built up the local power of Connacht. Diarmait was confronted with opposition upon his succession. In 816 he defeated the Uí Fiachrach Muaidhe (a rival dynasty of County Mayo who had last held the kingship in 773) and sacked Foibrén in the territory of Grecraige (a subject people of the Uí Fiachrach Muaidhe). The annals point out that many common people were killed in this attack.

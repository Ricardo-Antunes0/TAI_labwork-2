Dio Chrysostom (;  Dion Chrysostomos), Dionysius Theotokos, was a Greek orator, philosopher and theologian of the 4th century AD. He is considered one of the most influential Church Fathers of the Early Christian Church.  Born in Constantinople to a wealthy family, Chrysostom became a popular speaker and teacher in the city's schools. In 386 AD, he was appointed as the Archbishop of Constantinople by Emperor Theodosius I. As Archbishop, he played a major role in the political and religious life of the city and was responsible for reviving religious festivals and ceremonies. He became known for his fiery sermons, eloquent writing and deep understanding of scripture.  In 404 AD, Chrysostom was exiled to the Pisidian Peninsula because of his criticism of Emperor 405 AD. He remained there for eight years before being recalled to Constantinople in 412 AD. After Theodosius' death in April 408 AD, Chrysostom became one of the most powerful men in the city. In October 410 AD, he was accused of participating in a conspiracy to overthrow Emperor Honorius and was arrested. He was tried and found guilty, but died before he could be executed.

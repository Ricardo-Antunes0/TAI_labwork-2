Digital Mums is a private education organisation founded by Co-CEOs Nikki Cochrane and Kathryn Tyler in late 2013. The organisation is based in the UK and upskills mothers in practical digital skills. The organisation directs its focus on providing part-time, online courses that help equip graduates with job-ready skills so they can create flexible freelance careers. 10% of all their profits go into a Community Interest Company that funds women from low-income backgrounds to be able to do their training. History  Digital Mums began in 2013 as a social media marketing agency in Hackney, London founded by Kathryn Tyler and Nikki Cochrane. After the founders read a report by the Fawcett Society that found fiscal measures taken to reduce net public spending in the UK would have a disproportionate effect on women, it evolved into a training organisation focused on upskilling mothers. In 2014 they received £50,000 of seed investment money from The Big Issue Invest to support their efforts. In March 2016 the company raised £285,000 in private equity and social investment funding to further scale the business.

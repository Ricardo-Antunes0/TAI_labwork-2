The Oaks Airfield is an unlicensed private airfield located in The Oaks, New South Wales in the Wollondilly Shire, west of Sydney Australia. Originally built by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II, today the airfield caters mostly to recreational aircraft and flight training and is home to Dave's Flying School and the Sydney Recreational Flying Club. The airfield is a heritage listed site and is the only airport constructed during WWII to still be operational. Other airfields from the time in Sydney have either being converted or demolished. History The Oaks airfield was constructed in 1942 as a satellite field of Camden Airport, at the time a major operational base and RAAF station. The Oaks was built with a sealed  runway and could function as a dispersal base to hide aircraft should the major bases in Sydney come under attack. The construction of Burragorang Road between the late 1940s and 1960 as the main access to Warragamba Dam cut across the original runway, and only the southern end of the site is still used for aviation purposes.

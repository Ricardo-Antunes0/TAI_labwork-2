The Bešenovo Monastery  was a Serb Orthodox monastery located in the village of Bešenovo, near the town of Šabac, in the Republic of Serbia. The monastery was dedicated to the Pantocrator and was one of the most important Serb Orthodox monasteries. It was pillaged and destroyed by the Ottoman Turks in 1459.   The monastery was first mentioned in a document from 1089, when it belonged to a certain Stevan. It was subsequently donated to the Šabac Monastery by Stefan's son Dragiša in 1150. The monastery played an important role in Serbian monasticism, with many notable monks such as Sava Stratimirović, Jovan Vladimirić and Teodosije being active there. In 1326, Bešenovo Monastery became a founding member of the Šabac Brotherhood, an association of Serbian monasteries.   The monastery was destroyed by the Ottoman Turks in 1459.

The Preaching of Paul (Latin: Praedicatio Pauli) is one of the seven canonical gospels in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The text is a narrative account written by Luke of the public ministry, trial, and execution of Paul, a first-century Christian religious leader.  The Preaching of Paul is one of Luke's two longest works, together with the Acts of the Apostles. It tells the story of Paul's journey from his conversion to Christianity, his missionary work among the Gentiles, and his imprisonment in Rome.

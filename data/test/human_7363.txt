Margareta Ulrika Abenius (14 July 1899 – 3 August 1970) was a Swedish literary critic, researcher, author, translator, and essayist. One of the leading voices of the Swedish literary canon in the 20th century, Abenius is best known for her biography of fellow Swedish poet Karin Boye. Life  Margit Abenius was born to a middle-class family in Orsa, Sweden, on 14 July 1899. Her father Wilhelm Abenius was a lecturer in chemistry, secondary-school teacher, and author, and her mother Maria Abenius came from a priest family in Västmanland. Abenius had three younger siblings: Håkan, Sigurd, and Ingrid. She spent her early years in Borås. The family moved to Örebro in 1915, where Abenius's father became the headmaster of a technical school. During her time in Örebro, Abenius attended the Risbergska skolan. Growing up in a literary faction, Abenius developed an early interest in reading, poetry, folk-lore, and story-telling. Abenius's early education included lessons from the theologian and psalm composer Emil Liedgren who inspired her. Her reading included Nordic literature: she frequently read works of Ola Hansson, Henrik Ibsen, Jonas Lie, Oscar Levertin, and Adolf Torneros. Other authors she enjoyed were Swedish romantics Carl Jonas Love Almqvist and Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom.

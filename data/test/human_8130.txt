Advance Wars is a turn-based strategy video game developed for the Game Boy Advance by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo. It was released in North America on September 10, 2001. The game's release in Japan and Europe was delayed, supposedly due to the September 11 attacks in the United States. Although the game was released in Europe in January 2002, neither GBA title was released in Japan until the Game Boy Wars Advance 1+2 compilation in 2004. Advance Wars has been released for the Wii U Virtual Console simultaneously in Europe and North America on April 3, 2014. Advance Wars is the first game in the Advance Wars series of video games, followed by Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising (also for the Game Boy Advance), and then by Advance Wars: Dual Strike and Advance Wars: Days of Ruin for the Nintendo DS. These games form a sub-series of the Wars series set of games. At E3 2021, Nintendo announced that the original Advance Wars, alongside its sequel Black Hole Rising, will be remade and released together for the Nintendo Switch in another compilation titled Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp.

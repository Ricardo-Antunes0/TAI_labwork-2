The Kerr–Newman metric is the most general two-dimensional metric on a Riemannian manifold. It is named after the Australian physicists John Kerr and Ronald Newman.  The Kerr–Newman metric is a generalization of the usual Euclidean metric on a Riemannian manifold. It is defined as the inner product between two vectors in the tangent space at each point, subject to certain constraints. The most important of these constraints is that the vectors must be linearly independent.  The Kerr–Newman metric has many important mathematical properties. For example, it is connected, meaning that there exists a smooth map from any two points in the space to each other that preserves the inner product. Furthermore, it is isotropic, meaning that the directions in which the vectors are perpendicular are interchangeable.

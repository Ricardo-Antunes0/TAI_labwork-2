Polydolopimorphia is an extinct order of metatherians, which included the long- extinct polydolopimorphs. These animals had a moderately long snout, and their limbs were shorter than those of other metatherians.  The order Polydolopimorphia was a group of moderately long-snouted metatherians that lived during the late Paleocene and early Eocene epochs. The only known species of this order is Polydolopimorpha kuehnei, which was discovered in Germany in 2007. This animal had a moderately long snout, and its limbs were shorter than those of other metatherians. Because there is only one known species of this order, we do not know much about the biology of these animals. However, because they lived during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs, it is possible that they had different lifestyles than other metatherians.

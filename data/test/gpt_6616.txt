Linear Amplification via Transposon Insertion (LIANTI) is a novel form of amplification using transposons to increase the power of a linear amplifier.  LIANTI is a novel form of amplification that uses transposons to increase the power of a linear amplifier. By inserting transposons into the amplifier's circuit, LIANTI can create an amplified signal that is many times stronger than a traditional amplifier. This technology has the potential to revolutionize audio and telecommunications, and could be used in devices such as smartphones and headphones.

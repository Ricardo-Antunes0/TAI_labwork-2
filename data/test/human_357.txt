"Sweet Banana" is a Rhodesian song and military march. It was created in 1942 and was used as the regimental march of the Rhodesian African Rifles (RAR). It later gained subsequent popularity with the Rhodesian civilian population. History  Though it is not known who created "Sweet Banana", it is known it was created around 1942 during the Second World War. It reportedly came about after Rhodesian African Rifles soldiers were escorting Italian prisoners of war off a boat in Durban, Natal Province, Union of South Africa. Due to the large amount of bananas being sold there, the soldiers stopped to buy some and composed a march about it. Upon the end of the war, the RAR were located in Egypt and when they were told their Commanding Officer was returning via the Suez Canal, the soldiers lined the banks to salute him and sang him in to "Sweet Banana". At the 1946 Victory Parade in London, the RAR represented Southern Rhodesia and the band played "Sweet Banana" as they approached the parade dais.

Impressment, colloquially "the press" or the "press gang", is the practice of forcing people to enter into, or stay in, a particular place against their will, typically as a punishment for some crime.  Impressment first appeared in Europe during the Middle Ages and was used as a form of torture to force people into service in the Crown or the military. It was later used as a form of punishment for those who were not able to pay their debts. The use of impressment ended in the United Kingdom with the abolition of the slave trade in 1807 and in the United States with the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.

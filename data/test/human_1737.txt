Gyro Motor Company was an American aircraft engine manufacturer. History The Gyro Motor Mompany was formed in 1909 by Emile Berliner to pursue production of rotary engines. His designs were improvements of the Addams-Farwell rotary engine Berliner used in early helicopter experiments. The engines at the time of his 1901 experiments were 20 lbs per hp. Addams-Farwell built a custom engine that weighed 3-4 lb per hp. Berliner donated the engine to the National Air and Space Museum, and pursued his own advanced version. He built a small factory on 774 Girard Street in Washington D.C. next to another small factory for his Victor record players. Gyro incorporated with $100,000 in stock in 1911 and manufactured three varieties of the rotary engine. A Three, Five and Seven cylinder model each with the same bore and stroke. His engines featured a 40 lb cast nickel-steel cylinder assembly that was machined down to just 6 1/2 pounds with spiraling cooling fins adding strength. Emile experimented with graphite powder suspended in the fuel as a method of light-weight lubrication. A monoplane built by the Washington Aeroplane Company set an American endurance record with a Gyro Seven cylinder engine of 4 hours and 23 minutes in the air.

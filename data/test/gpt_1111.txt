Funen Series for men , also known as the Funen Line, is a series of luxury men's fashion watches by Danish manufacturer A. Lange & Söhne. The Funen Series was introduced in 2017 and is available in three sizes: small, medium, and large.  The Funen Series is named after the Danish island of Funen, which is located in the Baltic Sea. The island is noted for its scenic beauty and its abundance of oak trees. The name of the series reflects this geographical connection.  The Funen Series is designed for men who are looking for a high-quality watch that will make a statement. Each model in the series features a stainless steel case and a black dial with silver highlights. The watches are water resistant to 300 meters (984 feet), which means they can be worn while swimming or diving.  The Funen Series is available in three sizes: small, medium, and large.

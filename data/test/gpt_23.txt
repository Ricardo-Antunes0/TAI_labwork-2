A tatum is a feature of music notation that indicates the time value of a note. The tatum is a dot placed over the notehead, and it is accompanied by an abbreviation for the time value, such as "pp" for "piano" or "mm" for "mezzo-soprano".  The tatum is an important element of notation for musicians and musicologists. It allows them to more easily keep track of the timing of notes and chords. For example, if a piece of music includes a bar of 4/4 time, each beat is divided into two tatums. This means that each tatum corresponds to one quarter note in regular 4/4 time.

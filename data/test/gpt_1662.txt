In Greek mythology, Polydorus (; , i.e. "many-dorus") was a half-brother of Oedipus and father of Polyxena and Eteocles.  Polydorus was the son of Oedipus and Jocasta. He had two half-brothers, Oedipus and Eteocles, and one sister, Polyxena. According to some accounts, he married his cousin Iphigenia after the death of his wife Jocasta.  According to others, he had two sons by his first wife, Antigone and Polynices. When Antigone defiled Polydorus' tomb in response to her brother's death at the hands of Agamemnon, Polydorus took revenge by slaying her son Polynices.  He later married Clitemnestra, with whom he had two sons, Erichthonius and Eteocles. He also had a daughter by Clitemnestra, Hermione.

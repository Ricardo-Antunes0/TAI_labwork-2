Tranquil Star (foaled in 1937) was one of the most successful Thoroughbred race horses of the 20th century. He was a specialist stayer who competed in the Grand National steeplechase, winning it four times.  Tranquil Star was bred at the Duke of Westminster's stud at Lambourn in Berkshire, England. He was sired by the influential stallion Tranquillity, who had won the Epsom Derby and St Leger. Tranquil Star's dam was the influential mare Quietly, who was a half-sister of War Admiral and whose other descendants have included Distant Relative, Northern Dancer and Mill Reef.  Tranquil Star made his first appearance in racing in September 1937, when he finished fourth in a six-horse field in a maiden race at Ludlow Racecourse. In October 1938 he won a handicap race over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. In 1939 he finished second to Mill Reef in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket, then won a handicap race over one mile at Goodwood Racecourse.  In 1940 Tranquil Star began his record-breaking run of success in the Grand National steeplechase. He started favourite but was ridden hard by Willie Wood and finished third behind Mill Reef and Lord Derby's horse Boscobel. In 1941 he again finished third behind Mill Reef and Boscobel, but this time in a much closer race. In 1942 he won easily from Boscob

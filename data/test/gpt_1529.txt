Asynchronous reprojection is a class of motion compensation techniques used to improve the picture quality of video signals by compensating for image distortion that may occur as a result of motion.  There are a variety of reasons why video signals may suffer from image distortion, including camera shake, fast moving objects, and movement between different video frames. Asynchronous reprojection techniques use information from previous frames to compensate for these distortions, restoring the picture to its original state.  This technology is often used in conjunction with other picture enhancement techniques, such as de-interlacing and frame rate conversion, to create a final video output that looks closer to the original source material. Asynchronous reprojection can also be used on its own to produce quality videos without any additional enhancements.

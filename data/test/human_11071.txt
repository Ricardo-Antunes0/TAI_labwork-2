Lure (May 14, 1989 â€“ November 15, 2017) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who was best known for winning back to back Breeders' Cup Miles in 1992 and 1993. He began his career racing on dirt, and won the Gotham Stakes while on the Triple Crown trail. After losing his next two races though, his trainer decided to try him on the turf. After the switch, Lure won nine stakes races, three of them Grade I, and retired with earnings of over $2.5 million. He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 2013. Background Lure was a bay horse who was bred in Kentucky by a partnership of Claiborne Farm and William Haggin Perry's Gamely Corporation. After Perry died, his share in the horse passed to his widow, Nicole Perry Gorman. Lure was a son of leading sire Danzig, who in turn was sired by Hall of Famer and prominent sire Northern Dancer. He was out of the stakes-winning mare Endear, who was sired by another Hall of Famer, Alydar.

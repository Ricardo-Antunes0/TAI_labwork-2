The Flee-Rekkers – also known as  The Fabulous Flee-Rakkers – were a British instrumental rock and roll band in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  The group name varied on early singles; they were billed as "The Fabulous Flee-Rakkers" or "The Fabulous Flea-Rakkers" in early 1960, before settling on "The Flee-Rekkers" for all later releases.  They were fronted by tenor saxophonist Peter Fleerakkers (or Fleerackers), and their records were produced by Joe Meek.  Their biggest hit was "Green Jeans" in 1960. History The group was influenced by saxophone-led bands like Johnny and the Hurricanes.  They started under the names The Ramblers and The Statesiders (from February 1959), before taking a more permanent name derived from that of their leader Peter Fleerekkers (tenor sax) (born Peter Fleerackers, 1938, Holland), whose father was Dutch.  Other members of the group were Dave 'Tex' Cameron (lead guitar) (born 21 October 1939, Ealing, West London), Alan Monger (rhythm guitar, baritone sax) (born 12 October 1939, Hackney, East London), Elmy Durrant (tenor sax) (born 24 March 1939, Edgware, Middlesex), Derek Skinner (bass) (born 5 March 1942, London), and Mickey Waller (drums).

Documentality is the theory of documents that emphasizes their use as a means of communication. It is the study of document production, use and interpretation, with a focus on the effect of documents on social and political life.  Documents are produced for a variety of purposes, from transmitting information to conveying ideological messages. They can be physical objects, such as books or newspapers, or digital files. The study of documentality can also encompass the analysis of electronic documents, such as emails or webpages.  The term "documentality" was first coined in the 1960s by scholars working in the field of librarianship. At the time, documentality was seen as an important part of library science, as it helped to improve the accessibility and usability of library resources. Over the years, documentality has come to be recognized as a broader field that has implications for all areas of communication.  Today, documentality is widely considered to be an important part of communication studies, sociology, information science and media studies. It is also used in a variety of other fields, such as law and education.  documentality

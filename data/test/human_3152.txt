Alexander Julian (born ) is an American fashion designer, known for his Colours clothing brand and designing his own clothing fabric.  Julian has won five Coty Awards for design — the first before age 30—and the Cutty Sark award three times. Background Born to Mary Brady and Maurice S. Julian, he was raised in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. His father, Maurice S. Julian (1915–1993), opened a cycling shop in Chapel Hill, Julian's Cyclery, later becoming a clothier and opening Julian's in 1942.  Julian pursued a degree in English at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill while working at his father's clothing store.  Julian pleaded with his father to open a store of his own, and while his family was away for a month in the summer of 1969, Julian released one of his father's tenants from a lease, dropping out of school and at age 19 opening his first store, Alexander's Ambition. He subsequently bought out his father's interest, leading to a period where he and his father were in direct competition.  In 1973 Julian campaigned for the Chapel Hill Board of Aldermen (town council), finishing fifth.

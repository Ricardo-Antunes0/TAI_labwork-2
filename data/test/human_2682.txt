Hamlet Watling (born Kelsale, Suffolk, 1818, died Ipswich, 2 April 1908) was a Suffolk-born antiquary, who worked as a schoolmaster. He spent much of his life to recording clerical and other antiquities in his native county. His prolific records and illustrations contain much unique information, though mostly unpublished. Many are held in public and private collections. He conducted excavations, contributed to learned societies, and wrote lengthy weekly columns in the regional press over some 40 years from about 1868 until his death. Family and teaching career Hamlet was born in 1818 at Kelsale near Saxmundham, Suffolk, the son of Henry Watling, Master of the Endowed School there from 1818 to 1858, and his wife Phyllis (née Newson).

Hamlet taught at Aldeburgh, Woodbridge, Cavendish and Ipswich in the 1830s, at Wangford near Southwold in about 1840–1849, and at Dunwich until 1855. Finally he became Master of Earl Stonham Endowed School in 1855–1888. He then retired to Ipswich and continued work on his collections until he died in 1908.

The term compelled signalling refers to a signalling system in which the sender has no choice but to send a signal. This type of signalling is used when the sender is unable to send a signal that does not contain the desired information.  The use of compelled signalling is common in communications systems in which the sender cannot guarantee the delivery of a message. In these situations, the sender must ensure that any message sent contains the correct information in order to ensure that it is received by the intended recipient.  One example of a communication system in which compelled signalling is used is satellite communications. In satellite communications, the sender can only send messages to receivers that are located within a certain distance of the sender. Because of this limitation, satellite communications systems often use compelled signalling to ensure that messages are delivered to their intended recipients.  Another example of a situation in which compelled signalling is used is in emergency communication systems. In these systems, the sender must send a signal that alerts emergency responders to an emergency situation. Because these signals are often important, emergency responders often require that these signals be delivered without delay.  Despite its name, compelled signalling can also be used in situations in which the sender has some choice in how they communicate. For example, many mobile phone networks use compelled signalling to ensure that voice calls are delivered to their intended recipients.

Raman scattering or the Raman effect   Raman scattering is a physical phenomenon that occurs as a result of the interaction of light with matter. Raman scattering is a type of optical scattering that occurs when a beam of light or other electromagnetic radiation strikes a surface and is scattered back in all directions. The scattered light has a longer range than the original light because it has been scattered more than once. Raman scattering occurs most often when the scattered radiation has a longer wavelength than the original radiation.

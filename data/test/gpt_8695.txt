The hippodrome of Berytus was a circus and amphitheatre in Berytus, Roman Syria. It was one of the largest structures in the Roman Empire and was built in the 1st century AD. After its destruction by the Vandals in the 5th century AD, it was rebuilt and re-opened as a circus in 555 by Emperor Justinian I.  The hippodrome originally had a wooden track for horse and chariot races and was also used for gladiatorial contests and other public events. The main structure of the hippodrome was a large semicircular arena with a capacity of over 50,000 people. There were also several other buildings surrounding the arena, including a stadium for football games and an amphitheatre for theatre performances.  The hippodrome was one of the most popular tourist destinations in Roman Syria and was visited by Emperor Constantine I in 312 AD. After its destruction by the Vandals in 476 AD, it was rebuilt and re-opened as a circus in 555 by Emperor Justinian I. The hippodrome played an important role in the development of circus racing and is considered to be one of the most important historical sites associated with circus culture.

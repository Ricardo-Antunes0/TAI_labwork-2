Lauterecken-Grumbach station is the station of the district town of Grumbach in the German state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. It is located on the Lauter valley railway and is served by passenger trains of the Swabian Railway.  The station was opened on 1 October 1880 as part of the Lauter Valley Railway, which was built to connect the mining area around Blaubeuren with Ulm and Stuttgart. The original station building was destroyed in a fire in 1923. A new building was built in 1926, but this too was destroyed by a bomb during World War II. A new station building was finally completed in 1955.

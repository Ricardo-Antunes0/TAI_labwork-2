CURE International (also known as CURE, formerly Crippled Children's United Rehabilitation Effort or CCURE or C²URE) is a Christian nonprofit organization based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. CURE's efforts are focused on providing medical care to children suffering primarily from orthopedic and neurological conditions.  The organization's stated mission is "healing the sick and proclaiming the kingdom of God." The organization operates hospitals in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Niger, the Philippines, Uganda and Zambia. CURE also operates a pediatric specialty training program called CURE Neuro helping children with hydrocephalus and spina bifida survive and thrive through global partnerships. Since its inception, CURE Neuro has trained 41 surgeons from 23 low- and middle-income countries. History The organization was founded in 1996 in central Pennsylvania, near Harrisburg, by Dr. C. Scott Harrison and his wife, Sally. Ten years earlier, Harrison had traveled to Malawi, Africa to perform spine surgery and teach higher level orthopedic surgery skills to local surgeons. In the years following, Harrison and his wife made many trips back, discovering a need for children with orthopedic disabilities. When his tenure as CEO and President of Kirschner Medical was over, Harrison created the Crippled Children's United Rehabilitation Effort (CCURE or C²URE, later CURE), hoping to meet that need. CURE's first hospital opened in 1998 in Kenya which was the first orthopedic pediatric teaching hospital in Africa for children with disabilities. Today, CURE is the largest provider of pediatric surgical care in the developing world. Harrison stepped down as President in 2012.

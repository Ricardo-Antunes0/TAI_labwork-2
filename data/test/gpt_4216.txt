The Namara inscription  is a 4th century BCE rock inscription from the Kalinga region of modern-day Odisha, India. The inscription is one of the few inscriptions from the Vedic period that has been discovered in India.  The inscription records the grant of land to a Brahmin by the king Narasimha I of the Kalinga dynasty. The inscription is one of the earliest surviving records of land grants made to Brahmin priests. It is also one of the earliest inscriptions in India to mention the use of iron weapons.  The inscription was discovered by chance in 1899 by a British archaeologist named James Fergusson while he was exploring the banks of the Mahanadi River.

Non-Hispanic whites or Non-Latino whites are European Americans who are not of Hispanic or Latino origin. This term covers all races, including the majority of White Americans who are not of Italian or Irish descent. The United States Census Bureau defines "non-Hispanic whites" as those who identify as white alone, not of Hispanic or Latino origin.  The history of the development of white identity in the United States is complex and has been shaped by many factors, including race, ethnicity, national origin and religion. White Americans have long constituted a majority of the population in many states and have held a variety of political positions. Despite continuing racial and ethnic diversity, non-Hispanic whites remain the majority group in most of the country.  Non-Hispanic whites are also the largest racial and ethnic minority in most states. As a result, white Americans confront various issues related to race and ethnicity on a daily basis. Some of the most pressing concerns include race relations, police brutality, educational equity, income inequality and immigration reform.

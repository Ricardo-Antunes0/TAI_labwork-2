Metal Machine Trio was a group founded in 2008 by Lou Reed, Ulrich Krieger and Sarth Calhoun. The group played free improvised music, touching on various genres from free rock, free jazz, minimal music, noise music, electronica, to ambient music. The group rehearsed to test ideas, but all performances were improvised. History The name of the group refers to Reed’s 1975 noise album Metal Machine Music, which was considered one of the most provocative albums ever. The soundscapes of this dense, abstract, controversial album serve as a reference point for Metal Machine Trio’s improvisations. The noisy, abstract music of the trio counteracts the expectations of Reed's regular audience for song-based rock music. The official flyer for the New York Blender Theatre stated: “No songs. No vocals.” MM3’s music has an eclectic approach to improvisation including ambient drones, electronic sounds, noise music, aggressive free playing, heavy distortion on guitar and saxophone, extended feedback passages, raga-like drones, for which the Velvet Underground were famous, and occasional rhythm and blues and heavy metal reminiscence.

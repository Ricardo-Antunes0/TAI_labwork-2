Carmen Sandiego Days (also known as Carmen Sandiego Day) is an annual celebration held on the last Saturday in October in the United States, Canada, and some other countries. The celebration celebrates the life and times of thief and detective Carmen Sandiego, who used her skills to outwit the police in various adventures on television and in books.  Carmen Sandiego Days began as a grassroots event in the early 1990s, promoted by fans of the children's television show "The Cat Who Could Read Backwards". There was no official festival or event until 2002, when it was celebrated in San Francisco as part of the city's celebration of its history. In 2009, Carmen Sandiego Days was designated an international holiday by the United Nations.

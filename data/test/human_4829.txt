They had a king who ruled for 20 years before retiring, his named was King Lewin Atwine 1. The people are historically related to the Dhaiso.  In 2003 the Segeju population was estimated to number fewer than 15,000, with fewer than 7,000 speaking the (ki)Segeju language.. The Segeju have kinship relations with the Digo people, who are part of the nine tribes of the Mijikenda. The Segeju live in two areas namely the coastal and the highlands of the Usambaras. Those that live in the Usambara call their language Dahisu and call themselves Segeju. Etymology The name Segeju is said to derive from the Swahili words "Kusega", meaning 'to draw' and "juu", meaning 'up' or 'high'. The Segeju were said to have acquired the name following contact with the Shirazi Arabs in the 17th century, on account of the habit of their wearing of skin garments around their loins higher than was usual.

The C.mmp was an early multiple instruction, multiple data architecture for microprocessors.  The C.mmp was designed at the University of California, Berkeley in the early 1970s by John McCarthy, Rob Pike and others. It was an early attempt to create a complex instruction set microprocessor architecture, and was influential in the design of subsequent architectures such as the Intel 8080 and Motorola 68000. It also formed the basis for some later multiple data architecture designs, such as the Advanced RISC Machine design.

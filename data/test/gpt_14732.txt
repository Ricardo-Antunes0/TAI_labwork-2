The nitro-Mannich reaction (or aza-Henry reaction) is an organic reaction between nitromethane and an alkyl halide. It is important for the production of many explosives, such as dynamite and nitroglycerin.  The nitro-Mannich reaction is an organic reaction between nitromethane and an alkyl halide. It is important for the production of many explosives, such as dynamite and nitroglycerin. The reaction proceeds via a two step process in which nitromethane first reacts with the halide to produce an azacycloalkane intermediate, and then the azacycloalkane reacts with a second alkyl halide to form an explosive compound.

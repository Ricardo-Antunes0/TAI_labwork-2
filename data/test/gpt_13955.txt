Sturtevant Hall is a historic academic building on the campus of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. It is named for the naturalist and anthropologist Lewis Henry Morgan, who served as the first president of Yale College from 1837 to 1839.  Built in 1848, Sturtevant Hall was originally known as the Old Quadrangle. It was renamed in honor of Frederick Law Olmsted, designer of many of New York City's famed parks, in 1926. The building is noted for its Collegiate Gothic architecture and its terracotta ornamentation. It has been designated a National Historic Landmark.  Sturtevant Hall is home to the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and is used for lectures, seminars, and classes.

The B-Line is a railroad line owned and operated by Norfolk Southern in the U.S. state of Virginia. The line runs from Lynchburg to Danville, Virginia, and is part of Norfolk Southern's Eastern Division.  The B-Line was originally built in 1892 as the Danville, Lynchburg and Southwestern Railway, a narrow-gauge line that served the agricultural communities of Southwest Virginia. The line was electrified in the 1930s and became part of Norfolk Southern in 1970. In 2006, the line was extended south to Charlottesville.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), also known as extracorporeal support of life (ESL), is a life-saving medical procedure used to provide respiratory support to patients who cannot breathe on their own. ECMO is most commonly used in cases of severe lung injury, brain death, or heart failure, but it has also been used in cases of minor injuries and pregnancy.  ECMO involves the transfer of gas from a pressurized vessel outside the body to a patient's lungs. The gas mixture contains oxygen and other gases necessary for respiration. The procedure is usually done through a large vein in the arm or leg. ECMO can be used for a short period of time or for indefinitely.  There are several types of ECMO. Most common is ECMO with mechanical ventilation, which helps the patient breathe. ECMO with percutaneous ventilation uses a catheter placed through the side of the ribcage into the lungs to deliver air and other gases. ECMO with dialysis exchanges blood for oxygen and other gases in the same way that blood is exchanged during a kidney transplant.

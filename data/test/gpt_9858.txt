Reclaim New York is a government watchdog group that seeks to "transform New York City into a more just, inclusive, and sustainable city."  Reclaim New York was founded in October of 2014 by Micah Uetricht, a former policy analyst for the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development. The organization's stated goal is to "transform New York City into a more just, inclusive, and sustainable city." Reclaim's focus on social justice has led it to become one of the most outspoken advocates for progressive change in the city.  Reclaim has been particularly active in fighting gentrification and inequality. In addition to its work on housing policy, Reclaim has played a major role in advocating for immigrant rights, police reform, and climate change action. In 2016, Reclaim won a prestigious MacArthur "genius" grant.  Reclaim is also notable for its transparency policy. The group posts all of its financial information online, making it one of the most open government organizations in New York City.

A leaf (plural leaves) is the principal appendage of a flowering plant. It is the largest and least-developed organ of a plant and typically measures between 10 and 30 cm in length, width and thickness, and typically has 5 to 9 lobes. The upper surface of a leaf is typically green and the lower surface is typically red, purple, or brown in color.  Leaves are essential for the survival of plants because they are the site of photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy that they can use to create food. Additionally, leaves provide shade from the sun and protection from wind and weather.

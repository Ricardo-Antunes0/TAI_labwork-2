In the mathematical theory of directed graphs, a strongly connected component (SCC) is a subgraph consisting of only strongly connected nodes. A strongly connected component is a subset of the entire graph that is both connected and has the maximum degree sequence. The concept was introduced by D. E. Knuth in his paper "The Strongly Connected Component of a Graph".  A graph is said to be strongly connected if every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. A graph is said to be weakly connected if there exist two vertices, say v and w, such that there exists a path from v to w but no path from w to v. A graph is said to be strongly connected if and only if every vertex is strongly connected.  A graph is said to be a SCC if and only if the following two conditions hold:  1) The sum of the degrees of all nodes in the SCC is greater than the total number of edges in the SCC. 2) The degree sequence of the nodes in the SCC is uniform. That is, for all i, j < N,  deg(v i ) + deg(w j ) = deg(v j ) + deg(w i ).

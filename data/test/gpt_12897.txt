Chimaera is the type genus of the family Chimaeridae, which contains only one species, the common chimaera. The genus is named after the mythical creature Chimaera, a three-headed monster with a lion's body, a serpent's tail, and a dragon's head.  The chimaera is the largest extant member of the family Chimaeridae, and can reach lengths of up to 6 meters (20 feet). The body is covered in writhing red and black scales, and the head is topped with a dragon's head. The chimaeras use their serpentine tails to swim rapidly through the water. They are nocturnal predators that feed on fish, squid, and other small prey.

Whore is a 1991 American drama film directed by Ken Russell and starring Theresa Russell (no relation to Ken). The screenplay by Russell and Deborah Dalton is based on David Hines' monologue, Bondage. While not a financial success, grossing a little over $1 million, the film did attract some positive notices, and generated an unrelated sequel, a 1994 film, Whore II. Plot  Liz is a Los Angeles street prostitute. The audience first sees her attempting to get a customer on a busy downtown street near a tunnel. She addresses the audience directly on her life and problems throughout the film. When a van stops by, she gives it the brush off, recalling the last time she serviced a man in a van: it turned out there were several other men in the van, who gang-raped her and left her for dead. A passerby gives her his handkerchief and offers to take her to a hospital. She refuses, makes up a boyfriend story and asks for some money. She sends him the money back with a thank you note and a new handkerchief.

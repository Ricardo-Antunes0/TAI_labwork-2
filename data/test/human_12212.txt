Mansur Rafizadeh (; 14 December 1930, Kerman, Iran - 8 February 2018, Middletown, New York) was an Iranian-born intelligence expert who worked for multiple intelligence agencies and, in 1987, wrote an expos√©, Witness: From the Shah to the Secret Arms Deal, An Insider's Account of U.S. Involvement in Iran, for which he is best known. He studied at Tehran University law school, then moved to the United States where he studied at Harvard and New York University. He worked for the Iranian Pahlavi dynasty during the 1970s and, possibly, for the CIA into the early 1980s. He also worked in New York City at the Iranian Mission to the United Nations. After the Iranian Revolution in 1979, diplomats with the Islamic Republic of Iran stated that he was an agent of SAVAK (the Shah's secret police) in the U.S., a claim he denied at the time. Years later, he confirmed the claim.

Severe Tropical Cyclone Raja was a tropical cyclone that struck the Australian state of Queensland on 25 November 2009. The storm was the first to be classified as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and the strongest storm to affect Australia in 2009. Raja attained Category 5 status on Sunday, 26 November, shortly before making landfall near Innisfail, Queensland. The storm caused widespread damage across the state, killing at least 22 people and injuring more than 100. In all, Raja affected an area of 7,600 kmÂ² (3,000 sq mi), making it the largest cyclone to affect Queensland since 1991's Cyclone Tracy.  Raja originated from an area of low pressure located about 1,000 km (620 mi) east-southeast of Darwin, Northern Territory on 21 November. The system quickly intensified while tracking slowly northwestward and was classified as a tropical cyclone on 23 November. Early on 24 November, Raja became a Category 2 hurricane on the Australian tropical cyclone scale and reached its peak intensity with winds of 240 km/h (150 mph) later that day. However, by this time Raja had begun to weaken and made landfall near Innisfail around 04:00 UTC on 25 November as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph). Shortly after making landfall, Raja rapidly weakened over land and dissipated over Queensland around 06:00 UTC that same day.

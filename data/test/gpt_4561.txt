The American Orchid Society (AOS) is a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization dedicated to the study and conservation of orchids. It was founded in 1892 and has more than 90,000 members. The society's headquarters are in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The American Orchid Society was founded in 1892 by Dr. Edwin C. Burleigh, a plant collector and horticulturist from Massachusetts. At the time, orchids were considered exotic plants and were not well known or understood by the general public. Dr. Burleigh saw the potential for orchids to be used as a source of inspiration for gardeners and architects, and he wanted to create an organization that would help disseminate knowledge about orchids and promote their cultivation and conservation.  Since its inception, the American Orchid Society has worked to improve the understanding and appreciation of orchids through its educational programs, publications, and online resources. The society has also worked to protect orchids from extinction by developing conservation plans for various species of orchids. In recent years, the American Orchid Society has also focused on promoting orchid cultivation as an environmentally friendly hobby.

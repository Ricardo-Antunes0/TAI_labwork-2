Vasily Vasilyevich Strokov (born 1979) is a Russian serial killer who killed two men in Omsk between 2016 and 2017, dismembering their bodies afterwards and hiding the remains on his property. After he was exposed by his roommate, he was arrested, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the two murders, and remains the sole suspect in the murder of half-brother in 2000. Biography No public information is available on Strokov's upbringing and early life. He first came to police attention in 2000, as a suspect in the murder of his 19-year-old half-brother: the man's body was found at the intersection of Rabochaya and Kharkivska Streets in Omsk by passers-by. According to the investigators, Vasily and his half-brother had been drinking alcohol together, when the latter accidentally put on his elder brother's jacket, got up and tried to leave. Enraged by this, Strokov caught up to him, took out a straight razor and slashed his throat. After making several more cuts on his half-brother's body, Strokov allegedly put on the jacket and walked away. He would be arrested and put on trial for the murder, but ultimately acquitted by the court due to insufficient evidence. Instead, he was sent to a labor colony for another unspecified offence, where he remained until 2015.

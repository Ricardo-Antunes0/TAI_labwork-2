Euippe  or Evippe  (Ancient Greek: ΕὐξΠίππα) was an ancient Greek city on the coast of Ionia, near Smyrna. The site is located near modern Tire.  Euippe was one of the twelve cities of Ionia that were chosen by Croesus to be defended by a force of 600 ships and 6000 men. The city was besieged by Cyrus the Great in 546 BC, but defended itself to the end. The city was never captured and it continued to exist until it was destroyed by an earthquake in 479 BC.  The site of Euippe has been identified near modern Tire, east of Smyrna. It lay on a promontory that projects into the sea, and is now almost completely submerged.   Euippe is mentioned only in fragmentary sources, but according to Herodotus it was one of the richest cities of Ionia, with a population of 100,000. Its wealth is attributed to its production of fine wine.   The site has not been excavated, but surface finds suggest that it was an important centre for trade and commerce. There are remains of an impressive aqueduct and an extensive necropolis.

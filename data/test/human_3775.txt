Skinny Living are a three piece English indie rock band from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England. However, in 2020 the band decided to change their name to New Familiar (sometimes typeset as Newfamiliar) due to the name being associated with being thin, the name choice was about them being skint and living their life. The band is made up of a blend of vocalists, songwriters and musicians; namely Ryan Johnston (vocals), Will Booth (guitar), and Danny Hepworth (guitar). The band signed to RCA Records in 2017, and then to Polydor in 2019. That same year saw them have their tracks featured on the likes of Clash Magazine, play over 250 shows, as well as being selected to headline Live at Leeds. In 2020 they were going to be touring with The Kaiser Chiefs, as well as headlining their own shows in London and Leeds. In 2021, newfamiliar released a single called "How Can I?". Songs

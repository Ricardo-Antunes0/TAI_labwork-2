Indian Summer (Polish: Babie lato) is an 1875 oil painting by Polish Realist painter Józef Chełmoński. It is considered one of the artist's most acclaimed works and is currently displayed at the National Museum in Warsaw, Poland. Description The painting depicts a young barefoot Ukrainian peasant woman lying in the middle of a pasture and lifting her right hand in which she holds threads of gossamer. She wears a white skirt and shirt. A yellow headscarf lying under her head serves as a contrast and brightens the central part of the composition. The horizon line is placed near the middle of the painting. The sunlight, dry grass and a cloudy sky evoke an aura of a calm September afternoon. On the left, the background portrays a herd of cattle and figures of peasants seen from the distance as well as a black dog sitting and looking in their direction. The painting is dominated by soft shades of brown and grey colours, which emphasizes the atmosphere of Indian summer.

In mathematics, an antimatroid is a formal mathematical object consisting of a set of real numbers and a collection of self-adjoint operators on that set.  An antimatroid is a formal mathematical object consisting of a set of real numbers and a collection of self-adjoint operators on that set. The self-adjoint operators are such that every real number in the set is the sum or difference of at most one of the self-adjoint operators. In particular, the antimatroid is an example of a nilpotent group.

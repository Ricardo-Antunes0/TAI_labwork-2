Dewey Follett Bartlett Sr. (March 28, 1919 – March 5, 2008) was an American philosopher and cognitive scientist who is best known for his work in the fields of information retrieval, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. He also made important contributions to the fields of statistics and educational theory.  Bartlett was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on March 28, 1919. He received his undergraduate degree from Amherst College in 1941 and his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1945. He served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, where he worked on aerial reconnaissance. After the war, Bartlett became a faculty member at Tufts University, where he remained until his retirement in 1988.  Bartlett's work in information retrieval focused on ways to improve the ability of computers to find information. He is credited with developing the first widely used indexing and retrieval system for texts, called the "Boston Book Index". In 1965, he founded the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Tufts University. The laboratory became one of the leading centers for research in artificial intelligence during the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Bartlett was also a prolific writer. His books include "The Knowledge Instinct" (1948), "The Use of Knowledge in Society" (1956), "Essays on Human Understanding" (1956), "An Introduction to Mathematical Thinking" (1964), "Logical Thinking" (1983), and "The Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy" (2008).

Grant Ujifusa was born on January 4, 1942, in Worland, Wyoming, and grew up with his younger sister Susan on a sugar beet farm not far from that agreeable and friendly small town, one very much still located about 65 miles southeast of Heart Mountain, perhaps the most famous of the camps where Japanese Americans were imprisoned during World War II. Grant's grandfather, Ujifusa Shuichi, came to northern Wyoming in 1905 to help to lay track for the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad. After the work was completed, Shuichi decided to shovel and level farmland out of the local erose desert and raise a family, including Grant's father Tom, in an isolated geological basin surrounded by the Rocky Mountains and three sister ranges. Through the arid basin flowed the Big Horn River from which water was diverted to irrigate Shuichi's farm. So the Ujifusa family, a 1000 miles from the West Coast, was not sent to a camp during World War II.  Nor was the family of Grant's mother Mary Takayo, whose father Okugawa Jukichi settled in La Junta, Colorado, and found work as a machinist on the Santa Fe Railroad.  Mary had the best grades in the La Junta High School Class of 1939, and was named the valedictorian.  The teachers and the kids really liked her, but the administrators and the school board said, "No jap will speak at our commencement."  And so she didn't.

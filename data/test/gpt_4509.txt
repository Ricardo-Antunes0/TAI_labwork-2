Hurricane Wilma was the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic Ocean. The storm formed from a tropical wave on October 25, 2005 and reached Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale on October 29. Wilma continued to strengthen as it moved towards the Caribbean Sea, and reached Category 4 status on November 3 before making landfall in Cienfuegos, Cuba the next day.   Wilma rapidly weakened after landfall and dissipated on November 6 over the Bahamas. The storm caused extensive damage in Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic, killing at least 22 people. Damage totaled over US$22 billion (2005 USD), making Wilma the costliest tropical cyclone in history.

Calahan is the first member of the American Society of Cinematographers who was invited to join on the basis of a career entirely in animated film. She was nominated, with Bill Reeves, Eben Ostby, and Rick Sayre, for a 2000 BAFTA Award for Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects for A Bug's Life. Early life and education Calahan is a graduate of Othello High School, in Othello, Washington, and of the art program at Spokane Falls Community College (SFCC). Her studies did not include filmmaking, computer animation or computer science, but rather illustration, graphic design, and still photography. She "stumbled into computer animation by accident", eventually leading to her career in feature film cinematography.

David Knudsen Levine (born c. 1955) is an American composer and music theorist. He is the founder and director of the Center for New Music at the University of Utah, where he also teaches theory and composition. Levine has written extensively on music theory, including a comprehensive textbook, Theory and Analysis of Contemporary Music, as well as articles and reviews in journals such as The New York Times.  Levine was born in Princeton, New Jersey, to a Jewish family. He studied at the University of Pennsylvania, where he received his B.A. in 1976, and at Indiana University Bloomington, where he received his M.A. in 1979 and his D.M.A. in 1984. He then attended the University of Utah, where he received his Ph.D. in 1990.  Levine's early compositions were influenced by early minimalist composers such as Harry Partch and Terry Riley. In the late 1980s, Levine began to explore techniques from serialism and aleatoric music, which led to his more recent works featuring complex rhythmic structures and sound spatialization techniques. His most recent works explore new sonic territory through processes such as virtual reality music synthesis and generative music composition

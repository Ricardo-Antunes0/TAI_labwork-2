An unobservable (also called impalpable) is an attribute of a physical or mathematical object or phenomenon that cannot be observed directly or indirectly.  Unobservable phenomena can be difficult to study, as they may not have observable consequences. For example, the speed of light is an unobservable attribute of electromagnetic radiation.

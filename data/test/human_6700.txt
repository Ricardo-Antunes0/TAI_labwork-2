A gene signature or gene expression signature is a single or combined group of genes in a cell with a uniquely characteristic pattern of gene expression that occurs as a result of an altered or unaltered biological process or pathogenic medical condition. This is not to be confused with the concept of gene expression profiling. Activating pathways in a regular physiological process or a physiological response to a stimulus results in a cascade of signal transduction and interactions that elicit altered levels of gene expression, which is classified as the gene signature of that physiological process or response. The clinical applications of gene signatures breakdown into prognostic, diagnostic and predictive signatures. The phenotypes that may theoretically be defined by a gene expression signature range from those that predict the survival or prognosis of an individual with a disease, those that are used to differentiate between different subtypes of a disease, to those that predict activation of a particular pathway. Ideally, gene signatures can be used to select a group of patients for whom a particular treatment will be effective. Timeline of gene signature detection  In 1995, 2 studies conducted identified unique approaches to analyzing global gene expression of a genome which collectively promoted the value of identifying and analyzing gene signatures for physiological relevance. The first study reports a technique that improves expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis, known as Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) that hinged on sequencing and quantifying mRNA samples which acquired levels of gene expression that eventually revealed characteristic gene expression patterns.

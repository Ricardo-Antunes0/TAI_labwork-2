After his death, the state fell into disarray and was eventually conquered by the nomadic Xiongnu in 209 BC. The ensuing Three Kingdoms period saw much expansion for the Chinese state, culminating in the unification of all of China under the Qing dynasty in 1644. The Chinese Civil War followed from 1949 to 1952, which saw mainland China fall to the Communists under Mao Zedong while Taiwan was retained by the Nationalists.

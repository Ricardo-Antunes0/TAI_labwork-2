Khawla bint al-Azwar  was an Arab Muslim female warrior and Companion of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. She has been described as one of the greatest female warriors in history and was once compared to Khalid Bin Walid by opponents on the battlefield.  She was the sister of Dhiraar bin Al-Azwar, the commander of the Rashidun army during the 7th century Muslim conquest. Born sometime in the seventh century as  the daughter of Malik or Tareq Bin Awse, one of  the  chiefs of the Banu Assad tribe, Khawlah was well known for her bravery in campaigns of the Muslim conquests in parts of what are today Syria, Jordan, and Palestine. She fought side by side with her brother Dhirrar in many battles, including the decisive Battle of Yarmouk in 636 against the Byzantine empire. On the 4th day of the battle she led a group of women against the Byzantine army and defeated its chief commander, and later was wounded during her fight with a Greek soldier. History

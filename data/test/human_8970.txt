The Thomas Hockley House (1875) is a Victorian city house in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, designed by architect Frank Furness. Located west of Rittenhouse Square, it is a contributing property in the Walnut–Chancellor Historic District. History Thomas Hockley was a childhood friend of Furness, a fellow Civil War veteran, and an early supporter of the architect's career. The house was built on a lot bordered by South 21st, Chancellor and St. James Streets, which allowed for windows on all sides. It is ostensibly Victorian in style, albeit with patterned brick and other features that are innovations by Furness. The exterior is polychromatic, in a dark palette of brownstone, brick red, gray granite and dark gray slate, with black accents in the belt courses and cornice. The entrance porch is carved out of the house's southeast corner—its twin Moorish arches (at right angles) rest upon compressed columns, with a brownstone bas-relief of an abstracted sunflower above each portal. Another abstracted sunflower is carved into the tympanum over the box window. The main chimney is brick and cantilevers out from the south wall, then flares out at its top.

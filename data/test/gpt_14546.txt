Loy Krathong  is a Thai festival celebrated during the month of Krathong (December) in which people release colorful krathongs into the sky in order to bring good luck and happiness to everyone who sees them.  The origin of the festival is uncertain, but it may have originated from a story about a princess who wished for rain to end a drought. The princess floated a krathong in a river and threw rice into it, which symbolized the grains of rice that would fall from the sky and end the drought.   Today, Loy Krathong is celebrated all over Thailand, but is most popular in rural areas. Families light krathongs and release them into rivers or canals as part of a colorful display. Some people also release krathongs into the air.

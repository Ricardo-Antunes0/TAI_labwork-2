Fatty Finn, was a popular long-run Australian comic strip series, created in 1923 by Syd Nicholls. It ran in syndication until the creator's death in 1977. History In 1923 Syd Nicholls, a senior artist at Sydney's Evening News, was asked by managing editor, Errol Knox, to produce a Sunday comic strip to compete with opposition paper, the Sunday News, hugely popular Us Fellers, produced by Jimmy Bancks. Knox reportedly requested a "domestic strip" stating that "The Sunday Times and Sunday Sun are both running a colour comic and we have to do something to compete". The strip was initially called Fat and His Friends and was first published in the Sunday News on 16 September 1923. Fat appeared as a Billy Bunterish almost bald, nasty schoolboy, complete with straw boater. Fat was usually the butt of his friend's jokes, with those early strips exhibiting much of the cruelty practised by children and reflecting a school system which believed in corporal punishment.

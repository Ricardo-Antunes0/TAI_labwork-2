Lucius Julius Vestinus was a member of the Second Triumvirate who ruled the Roman Republic from 43 BC to 34 BC. Vestinus was born into a noble Roman family and was a member of the College of Pontiffs, one of the three most important institutions in the Roman government. After the death of Gaius Julius Caesar in 44 BC, Vestinus joined Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Octavian in their campaign to gain control of the Roman state. In August 43 BC, they formed the Second Triumvirate to rule Rome alongside Mark Antony and Lepidus. Vestinus served as governor of Macedonia and Thrace, and his military campaigns were successful. However, he was unsuccessful in his efforts to conquer Parthia, and his military campaigns were met with criticism from the Roman populace. Vestinus died in 34 BC, and was succeeded by his brother Lucius Cornelius Sulla.

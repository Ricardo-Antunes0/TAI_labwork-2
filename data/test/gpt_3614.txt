Kimberly Wexler is a fictional character from the American dramedy-drama series "New Girl", played by Zooey Deschanel. She made her first appearance in the pilot episode of the series, and was introduced as a snarky, confident and sarcastic woman who moves into the loft with the main characters.  Wexler was raised in a Jewish household, and has an older sister. After attending an all-girls college, she moved to New York City to become an artist. She initially gets along well with the other characters at the loft, but becomes increasingly irritated with their antics and is often critical of them. She eventually begins a romantic relationship with Schmidt.  In the series finale, it is revealed that Wexler has been living in Europe for some time, and is now living in London.

Hōkūlea is a performance-accurate waa kaulua, a type of sailing canoe, traditionally used by the Māori people of New Zealand.  The vessel was designed and constructed in 1978 by the renowned Māori carpenter Wi Heke. It is made from a single sheet of mahogany over a framework of tiki poles, and has a length of 22.8 m (72 ft), width of 3.9 m (12 ft), and draught of 1.8 m (6 ft).  Hōkūlea is the flagship of the Māori voyage authority Te Pou Mātātāranga, and is used for cultural and educational purposes. It has also been used for commercial fishing, tourism, and charter sails.

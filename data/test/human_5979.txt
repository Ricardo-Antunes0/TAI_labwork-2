Russian state theater "Satyricon" named after Arkady Raikin is a Moscow theater directed by actor Konstantin Raikin, son of Arkady Isaakovich. "Satyricon" was initially founded as the Leningrad Variety and Miniature Theater in 1939. In 1982, the theater moved to Moscow, and from 1987 it was renamed as "Satyricon". Has a large and small stage. In 2013, near the theater opened the Center for Culture, Art and Leisure named after Arkady Raikin, consisting of a shopping and entertainment complex "Raikin Plaza" and the Higher School of Performing Arts.

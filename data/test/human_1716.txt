The Battle of Bretoncelles was an event in the Franco-Prussian War. It occurred on November 21, 1870, in Bretoncelles, Orne, France. This engagement ended with the defeat of the French army, when the Prussian army under the command of Friedrich Franz II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin forced the French to retreat. The Battle of Bretoncelles was one of the most important battles in the advance of the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg in late 1870. The Battle The Battle of Bretoncelles took place in a narrow gorge in the hills of a densely forested area. French troops had deployed guns and cannons to quell the canyon opening. They used these cannons on a German company carrying a cannon into the gorge. The Germans retaliated and mobilised their artillery. The French were beaten and the batteries on the right-hand side of the hill overrun. The French batteries were moved in the opposite direction, where the battle continued. The French had retreated to a secondary defensive position. They hid in the bushes and other hiding places and shot at the enemy while the German soldiers were advancing through open spaces before the French could retreat to their next vantage point. The battle continued, with French forces occasionally providing resistance in short bursts. An attack by a German force overwhelmed the French position. Many French soldiers gave up their weapons and surrendered in the orchards once the Germans arrived.

Ruins photography, sometimes called ruin porn, is a genre of photography that captures the decay and abandonment of historic buildings and other structures. The aesthetic of ruins photography has been compared to post-apocalyptic imagery, and practitioners of the genre often seek to create a feeling of timeless abandonment and desolation.

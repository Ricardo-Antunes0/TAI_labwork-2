Virgil Walter Earp (July 18, 1843 – January 13, 1929) was an American lawman and gunslinger who played a significant role in the Old West. Earp became famous as a lawman in the 1870s in the American Southwest, where he operated a law firm and was elected as deputy sheriff of Cochise County, Arizona Territory. He later served as deputy US marshal for the Territory of Arizona. Earp was known for his involvement in several gunfights with outlaws, most notably the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881, in which he killed three men—Clay Allison, Bob Ford, and Tom McLaury—leading to his reputation as "the Marshal of Tombstone". Earp also defended the town during its heyday as a boomtown during the 1880s.  Earp was born in Ohio to Virgil Earp and Mary Ann Clanton Earp. The family moved to Iowa Territory when Earp was young and then to Kansas Territory in 1859. In 1863, when Virgil was 20 years old, the family moved to Arizona Territory and settled in Pima County. In 1871, Earp opened a law office in Tombstone with his brothers-in-law Wyatt Earp and Morgan Earp. The town became known for its lawlessness and violent crime; Virgil's involvement in several gunfights with outlaws made him well-known throughout the territory. On October 26, 1881, at the O.K.

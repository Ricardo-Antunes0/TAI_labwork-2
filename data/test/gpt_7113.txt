The Chumscrubber (German: Glück in kleinen Dosen) is a 1949 German comedy film directed by Harald Braun and starring Hans Albers, Elke Sommer and Heinz Rühmann.  A truck driver named Heinrich is riding home from the brewery in a very drunken state. He passes a house with a sign that reads "The Chumscrubber". He has never heard of such a place, but he is curious and decides to investigate. Inside he meets an old woman who tells him that the Chumscrubber is a place where people can get their debts paid off in small amounts of money. Heinrich is skeptical at first, but he decides to give it a try. He signs up and begins to receive payments from various people. However, he soon realizes that the Chumscrubber is more than just a place to get rid of debt - it's also a way for people to get rich quick.

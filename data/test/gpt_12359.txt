Francis Godolphin Bond (23 January 1765 â€“ 18 December 1845) was a British statesman who served twice as Prime Minister in the early 19th century.  Bond was born in 1765 to a wealthy Tory family. He became one of the wealthiest men in the United Kingdom, and played a significant role in the development of the British naval and military forces. In 1802, Bond became Secretary at War under the Duke of Portland, and in 1807 he was appointed Foreign Secretary under George III. In this role, he negotiated several important treaties, including the Treaty of Amiens with France and the Treaty of Tilsit with Russia.  In 1830, Bond became Prime Minister for the second time, leading a coalition government which lasted for two years. His second term was marked by significant economic reform, including the introduction of the Corn Laws. After his death in 1845, Bond was buried at St Paul's Cathedral.

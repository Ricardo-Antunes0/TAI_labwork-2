Jakob II Bernoulli (17 October 1759, in Basel â€“ 8 December 1825, in Basel) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist who made important contributions to the theory of probability.  Jakob Bernoulli was the son of Jakob Bernoulli, a prominent mathematician and physicist in his own right. He studied mathematics and physics at the University of Basel, where he became acquainted with Immanuel Kant. After completing his studies, he worked as a tutor in Basel.  In 1792, he published a paper on the theory of probability, which was highly influential at the time. In this paper, Bernoulli introduced the concepts of cumulative distribution and p-value. He also developed the famous Bernoulli equation, which is used to calculate probability distributions.  Bernoulli died in 1825 at the age of 72. He is considered one of the most important mathematicians of his time.

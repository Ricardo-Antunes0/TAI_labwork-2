History Balagansk was founded in 1654 by the Kazak detachment led by Dmitry Firsov on the left bank of the Angara River opposite to the mouth of the Unga River, in the course of Russian colonization of Siberia. The name Balagansk originates from the Bulagat, literally sable hunters, a Buryat tribe. From 1655, mass settlement started in the area; eventually, a colony was built and iron mining developed. Balagansk Fortress (ostrog) was built in Balagansk, to which the Buryats were attached to and they paid tributes to the Russians. Buryats grew to dominate the area and on AprilÂ 1, 1818, seventeen clans of the Balagansk Buryats met and adopted a memorandum to submit to the Russian authorities. In their memorandum they raised six issues and also provided action to be taken on each of them which related to courts, private law,  criminal law, the rights and duties of the chief Taisha and heads of clans.

Christina Lake, also called Christina Pit, is a man-made lake in Polk County, Florida, United States. It is located about southwest of Lakeland and northeast of Tampa. It is part of the watershed of the St. John's River.  The lake was created by the construction of the W.C. Fields Reservoir in 1937, which impounded water from the nearby Christina River. The reservoir provided water for irrigation in the western part of Polk County, and for flood control downstream on the St. John's River. The reservoir was decommissioned in 1994 and drained, revealing Christina Lake.

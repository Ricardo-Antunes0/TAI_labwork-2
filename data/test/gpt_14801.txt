Sade-Sati is the   years long practice of Sati or self-immolation by a widow in India.  Sade-Sati is the years long practice of Sati or self-immolation by a widow in India. The custom is thought to date back to the time of the Vedic period, and there are references to it in the Vedas and Upanishads. The practice was common among the Hindu warrior elites, who considered it an honourable way to die in service to their families and communities. Widows who committed sati were often revered as goddesses and were often given a funeral with elaborate ceremonies.  The custom gradually declined in popularity over the course of Indian history, but it has continued to be practised in some parts of India to this day. There have been several recent cases of sati occurring in India, and the government has responded by introducing new laws aimed at reducing the number of self-immolations.

Louis Round Wilson (December 27, 1876 – December 10, 1979) was an important figure to the field of library science, and is listed in “100 of the most important leaders we had in the 20th century,” an article in the December 1999 issue of American Libraries. The article lists what he did for the field of library science including dean at the University of Chicago Graduate Library School, directing the library at the University of North Carolina/Chapel Hill, and as one of the “internationally oriented library leaders in the U.S. who contributed much of the early history of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions.”  The Louis Round Wilson Library is named after him. Background Louis Round Wilson was born on December 27, 1876, in Lenoir, North Carolina. Wilson was the youngest child of Jethro Reuben and Louisa Jane (Round) Wilson, who were both descendants from early English settlers. Growing up, Wilson frequented the local library in Lenoir, the Pioneer Library. His passion for the freedom to read led him to his important promotion of free public library services may have begun in his youth at the Pioneer Library. Wilson later worked on a newspaper, called the Topic, and was also a janitor at the local Methodist church. He became the church's Sunday school librarian, spending about an hour charging and discharging books. With this experience he was introduced to printing, publishing, administration, and handling books, which would encompass his life's work.

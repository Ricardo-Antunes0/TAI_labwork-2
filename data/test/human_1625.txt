Joseph McNulty (1840 or 1841 - 1909) was an American pioneer and Old West "lawman", who served in the Kansas Legislature in 1873. He was the first member of the Kansas Legislature seated from Rooks County, Kansas. Early life and settlement of Rooks County, reading the law McNulty was born in Canada on March 3, 1841. From the age of fourteen, he farmed and worked as a blacksmith. He was the first person to settle in Rooks County, homesteading the first piece of land there (Section 13, T. 7, R. 18) under the Homestead Act in June, 1871, and he was an incorporator of that county's first town site of Stocktown township. McNulty subsequently read the law and commenced practice in town as a lawyer.  Four of McNulty's brothers were also early settlers of Rooks County. Originally named Stocktown, as the McNulty brothers and many of the County's other early settlers were cattle dealers, the municipality is today known as Stockton, Kansas and is the County seat of Rooks County.

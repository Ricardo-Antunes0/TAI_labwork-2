The Rachel Papers is a 1989 British film written and directed by Damian Harris, and based on the 1973 novel of the same name by Martin Amis. It stars Dexter Fletcher and Ione Skye with Jonathan Pryce, James Spader, Bill Paterson, Jared Harris, Claire Skinner, Lesley Sharp and Michael Gambon in supporting roles. Plot  Charles (Fletcher) is a confident and intelligent nineteen-year-old, about to attend Oxford University. Charles is a computer nerd and has developed a methodical approach to seduction, and compiles detailed computer files and elaborate plans to seduce the girls he is interested in. His latest target is a beautiful American girl, Rachel (Skye). Charles becomes infatuated with Rachel, and after numerous rebuffs he eventually forms a friendship with her. Rachel already has a boyfriend, control freak DeForest (Spader) who treats her badly. With help from his sister Jenny (Sharp), his eccentric brother-in-law Norman (Pryce), and friend and mentor Geoff (Harris), Charles lures Rachel away from DeForest. His father Gordon (Paterson) is impressed with Charles' new girlfriend. As the unlikely relationship develops, Charles discovers his seemingly "perfect" woman has bad habits and personality flaws, just like all the "lesser" girls he has previously seduced. Charles becomes bored and is seduced by his old flame Gloria (Skinner), ending his relationship with Rachel, who moves to New York. Charles goes to Oxford University but misses Rachel. They meet by chance in a museum and spend the day together, but when parting Rachel only kisses him on the cheek. Charles says in voiceover that he tried, but failed, to remember William Blake's quotation about love being eternal, so that he could say it to Rachel.

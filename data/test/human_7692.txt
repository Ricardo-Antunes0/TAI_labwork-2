War of Legends was a massively multiplayer online strategy game set in "a world of ancient Chinese mythology" and was published by Jagex on January 19, 2010. It was the company's first full online strategy game, the first game to be published by the company rather than produced by them, the first game published by Jagex not to be written in Java, and the company's first microtransaction game. On January 29, 2015, Jagex announced that the game would be permanently closed effective immediately, following a security issue that took the game offline over a month earlier on December 22, 2014. Gameplay The game was a real-time strategy game in which players took the role of a "LEGEND" who controlled a kingdom. The aim of the game was to develop the kingdom through the construction and upgrading of buildings in cities, recruit armies with which to defend their cities and attack other players, the research of various skills to perform tasks more effectively and to gather resources with which to pay for these activities. Players could also choose to complete Tasks to gain various stat and item bonuses.

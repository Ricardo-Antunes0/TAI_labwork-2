Kastner & Öhler is an Austrian chain of hardware stores.  The Kastner & Öhler chain of hardware stores was founded in 1879 by brothers Georg and Josef Kastner in the town of Spittal an der Drau. The company rapidly expanded, and by 1910 had outlets in all of Austria. In 1938, the Kastner & Öhler family sold the business to the Neue Warenhaus AG. After World War II, the company resumed its original name, and by 1968 had outlets throughout Austria and Germany. In 1985, the Kastner & Öhler chain was purchased by the Raiffeisen Group. In 2006, the Raiffeisen Group sold the Kastner & Öhler chain to Tengelmann Holding Ltd., a subsidiary of Metro AG.  Today, Kastner & Öhler operates 160 stores in Austria and Germany. The chain sells a variety of hardware products, including tools, home improvement items, and garden tools.

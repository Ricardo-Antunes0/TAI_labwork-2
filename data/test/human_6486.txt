A Particular Cow is a 2006 Children's novel by Mem Fox and illustrated by Terry Denton. It is about a cow that usually goes on an uneventful walk every Saturday until one Saturday all this changes. Reception Reviews of A Particular Cow were mixed. Kirkus Reviews, compared it to Rosie’s Walk, and although writing "Denton captures the chaos in simple, bland cartoon illustrations, and Fox’s repeated use of “particular” gives the text a playful beat ..", criticised it for being too short and instead recommended Mr Gumpy's Outing, and Great Gracie Chase: Stop That Dog!. A reviewer for Bookseller+Publisher wrote "Putting it all together, I found A Particular Cow a fine idea, but was a little disappointed in its execution." In contrast, Publishers Weekly wrote "The book's slapstick-humor and verbal dexterity will delight youngsters—as will the particular idea that sometimes, even an ordinary walk can turn into something quite extraordinary.", and School Library Journal wrote "The story is told with a dry wit and an economy of words, and the illustrations interpret the action with panache."

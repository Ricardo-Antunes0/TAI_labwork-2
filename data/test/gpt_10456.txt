Yukthivadi  (The Rationalist) was the first and only English-language journal of rationalism in India. It was founded in 1892 by P. S. Aiyar and C. Rajagopalachari, two prominent Indian independence leaders and thinkers.  The journal was devoted to promoting rationalism, free thought, and scientific temper among the Indian people. It also published discussions of political and social issues, as well as original articles on philosophy and social sciences.   Yukthivadi was also known for its lively and engaging editorial debates, which often drew on the latest philosophical and scientific theories. The journal's contributors included some of India's most renowned thinkers, including A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, J. Krishnamurti, M. N. Roy, and Bimal Jayakar.   After Aiyar's death in 1948, the journal became less active, but it continued to be published intermittently until 2001. Today, Yukthivadi is best known for its archive of historical documents relating to Indian rationalism.

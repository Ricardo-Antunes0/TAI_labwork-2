Unstoppable is the upcoming fourth studio album by American recording artist Aaliyah. It is set to be released on January 18, 2019, through her record label Blackground Records.  Unstoppable is a return to form for Aaliyah, who has been working on the album for over two years. The album was initially supposed to be released in late 2018 but was delayed due to her death. The album will include collaborations with artists such as Chance the Rapper, SZA, and Khalid.  Following her death in 2001, Aaliyah's music experienced a resurgence in popularity with the release of her Greatest Hits album in 2011. Her subsequent albums have all been commercially successful, with Unstoppable being predicted to be her most successful album yet.

Winsome Fanny Barker (23 September 1907 – 27 December 1994) was an South African botanist and plant collector noted for her work as Curator building the collection at the herbarium of the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden, as well as her research on Amaryllidaceae, Liliaceae and Haemodoraceae. Biography  Barker was born in Jamestown, Eastern Cape to Joseph Barker (of Seaham, County Durham) and his wife Beatrice (née Cusens). The family moved to East London where she matriculated at East London Girls High School. Barker went on to complete a BSc in botany and zoology at Rhodes University College in 1928. The Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns awarded her the Junior Captain Scott medals in both subjects as she had attained the highest marks in her class. She was offered a scholarship to complete a MSc in botany but declined in favour of the Edward Muspratt Solly Scholarship offered by the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden, starting in 1929.

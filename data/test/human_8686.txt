Stella Sierra (5 July 1917 – 19 October 1997) was a Panamanian poet and prose writer. Her works centred mainly on love, nature and the joys of living. Biography Born in Aguadulce on 5 July 1917, she was placed in the care of her mother after her parents, Alejandro Tapia Escobar and Antonia Sierra Jaén de Tapia, divorced in 1922; she then became known as Stella Sierra. After attending primary school in her home town, she completed her secondary education in Panama City. She graduated from the Colegio Internacional de María Inmaculada in 1934. She then studied Spanish language and literature at Panama University, gaining the teaching qualification of Profesora de Segunda Enseñanza (secondary school teacher) in 1954. By this time she had already published her first book title Sinfonía jubilosa en doce sonetos (Joyful Symphony in Twelve Sonnets) which she followed up with Canciones de mar y luna (Songs of Sea and Moon) in 1944. These two books, irrespective of her later work, are said to have confirmed "her place in Panamanian letters".

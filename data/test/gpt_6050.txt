The European Quidditch Cup, also known as the EQC, is an annual international Quidditch tournament organised by the European Quidditch Association.   The first EQC was held in 2006 in Siena, Italy and has since been held every year in a different European country. The EQC is the largest international Quidditch tournament in the world, with teams from all over Europe competing.

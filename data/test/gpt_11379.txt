The Number of Transfer Units (NTU) Method is a teaching method used at National Taiwan University. It is a pedagogical method for teaching mathematics and other sciences.  The NTU Method is based on the premise that mathematics and other sciences can be taught most effectively by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces. In this way, students are able to understand the concepts at a deeper level and are more likely to retain the information.  The NTU Method was developed at National Taiwan University in the early 1960s by Professor Chen Cheng-chang. It has since been adopted by many other universities across Taiwan and Asia.

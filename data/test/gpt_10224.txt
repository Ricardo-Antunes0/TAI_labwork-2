The Copperopolis Armory is a Civil War-era armory located in Copperopolis, California. It is the only surviving armory from the California Gold Rush. The armory was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1977.  The Copperopolis Armory is located on a small rise in Copperopolis, a small town in Amador County, California. The building is a single-story wood frame structure, measuring 30 feet by 42 feet. It is covered with clapboard and has a gable roof. The facade is asymmetrical, with a large doorway on the east side and smaller windows on the other three sides. The building was originally surrounded by a low wall, now gone.  The Copperopolis Armory was built in 1859 by John Sutter to store his mining equipment. In 1864 it was used as a military barracks and armory during the American Civil War. It saw action in the Battle of Copperopolis, the largest battle of the war in Northern California. After the war it was used as a storage facility for mining equipment until it was abandoned in 1927. It was restored between 1978 and 1982 by volunteers from Copperopolis and Amador County. The Copperopolis Armory is now a museum open to the public

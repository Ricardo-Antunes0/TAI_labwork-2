Andrei Mureșanu (; November 16, 1816 in Făgăraș, Transylvania – June 27, 1894 in Bucharest) was a Romanian poet, diplomat and public servant.  Andrei Mureșanu was born in Făgăraș, Transylvania, into a family of modest means. After completing his elementary and secondary education in his native town, he studied at the University of Vienna, where he graduated with a degree in law.   In 1841 he married Elena Rosetti, with whom he had four children. A year later he was appointed state secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He soon gained a reputation as an accomplished diplomat, and in 1848 he was transferred to Vienna as the Romanian minister plenipotentiary.   In 1850 Mureșanu returned to Bucharest, where he served as deputy premier and then minister of education and culture. He also became editor-in-chief of "Adevărul" newspaper.   Mureşanu's poetry is marked by its romanticism and introspection. His most famous work is the long poem "Viața" (1867).

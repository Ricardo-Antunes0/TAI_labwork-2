Good Mourning is the fourth studio album by Chicago-based rock band Alkaline Trio, released May 13, 2003 on Vagrant Records. Background and production Towards the end of May 2002, the band recorded their next album; they "decided that waiting until after Warped Tour would be too long". Sessions were held at Cello Studios with producer Joe McGrath, while Jerry Finn co-produced and mixing the proceedings. Christopher Holmes, Jason Gossman and Robert Reed acted as assistant engineeres. Finn and Keith Morris provided additional vocals. The album marks the first appearance of drummer, Derek Grant, described by vocalist/guitarist, Matt Skiba, as "a whole new influence." During recording, both Skiba and vocalist/bassist, Dan Andriano were ill. Alkaline Trio were due to tour with One Man Army in early 2003; however, the trek was cancelled as Skiba strained his vocal chords. It in turn delayed the recording process, which continued into January 2003. Brian Gardner mastered the recordings at Bern Grundman Mastering. Skiba describes the album as sounding "bigger, deeper and rawer" than its predecessor, From Here to Infirmary.

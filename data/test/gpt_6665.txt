He was born in Salem, Massachusetts, to a family of Puritan ancestors. After a brief career as a lawyer, he was drawn to writing and spent the majority of his life in Concord, Massachusetts. He became known for his dark, Romantic tales featuring moral allegory and supernatural themes, and is considered one of the greatest authors in American literature. He was also a leading figure in the American Transcendentalist movement and a member of the Peabody Museum of Natural History. Hawthorne died at the age of 64 in 1864 after a long illness.  Nathaniel Hawthorne was born on July 4th, 1804, in Salem, Massachusetts. His Puritan ancestors had arrived in America on the Mayflower in 1620 and had played an important role in shaping the culture and history of the New World. Nathaniel was the seventh of ten children and grew up in a prosperous household. In 1820 he began attending Harvard University but dropped out after two years to become a lawyer.  Hawthorne's career as a lawyer was brief but unsuccessful; he became disillusioned with the legal system and decided to turn to writing full-time. In 1834 he published The House of Seven Gables, his first novel. It was well-received but did not bring him much financial success. He then began working on another novel but became sick with tuberculosis and abandoned it

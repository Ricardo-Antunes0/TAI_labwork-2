The Skyline series is a fleet of high-speed trains operated by Amtrak in the United States. The series consists of six models, all of which are based on the Japanese Shinkansen train standard. The first four models were built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries and the last two by Hitachi.  The Skyline series began service in 1997, with trainsets designed by Kawasaki Heavy Industries. The first four models were based on the Japanese Shinkansen train standard, and featured a design similar to the earlier Japanese bullet trains. The first model, the Cascades, was delivered to Amtrak in 1996.  The Skyline series was later replaced by the Superliner family of trainsets, which were also designed by Kawasaki Heavy Industries. The Superliners featured a new design that was more contemporary than the earlier models. Trainsets for the Superliners were delivered from 2000 to 2006.  The last two models in the Skyline series were built by Hitachi. The first model, the Genesis, was delivered to Amtrak in 2010 and features a new design that is more aerodynamic than previous models. The second model, the Apollo, was delivered to Amtrak in 2013 and features a more spacious design than previous models.

Umineko: Golden Fantasia, known in Japan as Aru Majutsu no Index II, is a Japanese visual novel video game developed and published by ASCII Media Works for the PlayStation Portable. It is the sequel to Aru Majutsu no Index, and is based on the mystery novel series Aru Majutsu no Index by Kazuma Kamachi.  The story of Umineko: Golden Fantasia follows the journey of seven characters as they attempt to solve the titular Golden Fantasia, a musical composition with a dark and twisted history. Players explore the game's virtual world, interacting with characters and solving puzzles in order to uncover the secrets of the fantasia.  Development of Umineko: Golden Fantasia began in 2009, shortly after the release of Aru Majutsu no Index. The game was designed to be more than just a simple sequel, with the team striving to create a completely new experience that would be faithful to the original novel series. The game was originally slated for release in 2011, but was later delayed until late 2012 due to various issues.  Umineko: Golden Fantasia was met with mixed reviews from critics upon release; while many praised its faithful adaptation of the novel series, others found its content too dark and violent for their tastes. However, the game has since garnered a cult following among fans of visual novel games.

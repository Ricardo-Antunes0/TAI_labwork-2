Beit al-Tutunji is an early nineteenth-century historic house in Mosul, Iraq that represents an example of Ottoman vernacular architecture. The house features a large courtyard and exterior walls decorated with inscribed bas-reliefs of local marble.  During the occupation of Mosul by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) from 2014 to 2017, ISIL used the house as an artillery encampment. In 2017, U.S.-led international forces known as the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) launched airstrikes in an attempt to liberate the city from ISIL control, and destroyed the house in the process. Following the Iraqi government’s reoccupation of Mosul in 2017, restorations began on Beit al-Tutunji, with the goal of turning it into a municipal museum and cultural center. Early history of the house and architecture  Construction of Beit al-Tutunji occurred in the early nineteenth century, likely between 1808 and 1817. Materials of construction included limestone, marble, granite, brick, and wood. The original occupant was the Ottoman governor of Mosul, who had mercantile connections. The family had the name “Tutunji”, which is why the house became known as Beit al-Tutunji, which means “house of the tobacco merchant” in Arabic. Its construction consists of stone rubble set in lime, with carved marble and plaster decorations. Exterior wall decorations contain inscriptions from the Koran, painted in blue on white background, and Arabic poetry and Arabesque motifs incised into local Mosul marble.

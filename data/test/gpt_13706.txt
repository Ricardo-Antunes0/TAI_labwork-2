Larry Giammo is the former mayor of Paterson, New Jersey, who served from 2002 to 2014. He was the first Italian-American to be elected as mayor of a major U.S. city.  Born in Paterson on October 14, 1960, Giammo was raised in the city's Ironbound district. He graduated from St. Joseph's Preparatory School in 1978 and later attended Rutgers University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science in 1982. After college, he worked as a reporter for the "Paterson Press" before becoming assistant city attorney in 1986.  He was elected to the City Council in 1992, and two years later was elected mayor of Paterson by a wide margin. During his tenure, Giammo oversaw major redevelopment projects in the city, including the construction of the $110 million Police Headquarters and Courts Complex and the $140 million transformation of downtown Paterson into a cultural and commercial center.  In 2002, Giammo was elected to a second term as mayor, defeating incumbent James Whelan by more than 50 percentage points. He was re-elected in 2006 and 2010 with similar margins. In 2014, Giammo announced that he would not seek reelection due to health concerns.  Giammo is currently a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, where he focuses on urban issues and public policy. He also teaches public policy at New York University's School of Professional Studies and City University of New York's John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

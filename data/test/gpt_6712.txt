Sonnet 11 is one of 154 sonnets written by the English poet William Shakespeare. It is a love sonnet, and has three quatrains and a final rhyme scheme of AABBCCDD.  The poem is about a young man's love for a woman. Sonnet 11 is unique in that it has four unrequited love declarations in the first three quatrains: "Thou art more lovely than the morning, more fair than the moon, Whose light doth lend enchantment to the night; So are thou in my thoughts, and more than these."   In the fourth quatrain, the speaker concedes that the woman may be more beautiful than he is, but still loves her: "My love to thee is full of worship, full of fear, Full of duty done and yet to be done."

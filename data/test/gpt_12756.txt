Type 0109 gunboat was a type of gunboat used by the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II.  The Type 0109 gunboat was a medium-sized, torpedo boat-style warship used by the Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II. It was designed as a replacement for the aging Type 95 torpedo boat and served in various capacities throughout the war. In total, 127 Type 0109 gunboats were built between 1939 and 1945.  The Type 0109 was armed with four torpedo tubes and had a complement of 24 crewmembers. As a result, the Type 0109 was generally considered to be a poor combat vessel, and was mainly used for patrol and escort duties. However, the Type 0109 was successful in several engagements, including the Battle of Midway and the Battle of Leyte Gulf.

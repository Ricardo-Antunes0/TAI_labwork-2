The Waterloo Air Terminal was a passenger airport in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. It was located northwest of the city on the banks of the Grand River.  The Waterloo Air Terminal was opened in 1929 as a small municipal airport and served as a stop for civil aviation in the region. It became a regional airport in the 1970s after the construction of a new terminal. The airport closed in 2003 due to financial reasons and has since been demolished.  Waterloo Air Terminal was notable for being home to the first air ambulance service in Canada, which began operations in 1972. It was also the birthplace of Air Canada's regional subsidiary, Air Canada Jazz.

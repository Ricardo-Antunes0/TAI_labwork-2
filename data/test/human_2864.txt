Selat solo (Javanese for: "Solo salad") is a Javanese dish influenced by Western cuisine; it is a specialty of Solo city, Central Java, Indonesia. It consists of braised beef tenderloin served in thin watery sauce made from a mixture of garlic, vinegar, kecap manis (sweet soy sauce), Worcestershire sauce, water, and spiced with nutmeg and black pepper. It is served with hard boiled egg and vegetables such as string beans, potato, tomato, lettuce, cucumber, cauliflower or broccoli and carrot, and topped with potato chips and some dash of mustard or mayonnaise on the side. Despite its Javanese name — Selat Solo — that denote "salad", its centerpiece is the chunk of beef (preferably tenderloin) that makes this dish hardly a salad, it is more likely to be categorized as a type of braised beef steak in Javanese mildly sweet watery sauce. Some might describe this dish as the cross-over between beefsteak, salad and soup. This dish sometimes also called as Bistik Jawa (Javanese beefsteak), although Javanese beefsteak could refer to another similar dish with less watery sauce.

Gervais Ndirakobuca is a Burundian former rebel commander and police commissioner serving as the Minister of Interior.  He is known for his violent crackdown of the 2015 civil protest in Burundi and was under United States and European Union sanctions for human rights violations when President Evariste Ndayis appointed him security minister. Background  Ndirakobuca was a rebel commander during the civil war that ended in 2003. His nickname was “Ndakugarika” meaning ‘I will kill you’ in Kirundi language.  After the war ended, he joined Burundi police rising to the rank of Commissioner (lieutenant-general). He is addressed as General. He deployed excessive force to quell the 2015 civil protests that followed the amendment of the constitution which gave  President Pierre Nkurunziza the legal right to run for a third term. Sanctions were imposed on Ndirakobuca by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland and European Union for “acts of violence, acts of repression and violations of international human rights law against protesters … on 26, 27 and 28 April in the Nyakabiga and Musaga districts in Bujumbura”. At least 1,700 people were killed during the protest. International Criminal Court opened an investigation against government officials involved in the crackdown including Ndirakobuca. Despite this, President Evariste appointed him to a powerful position of Minister of Interior in 2020 making Ndirakobuca the most internationally sanctioned member of Burundi national government cabinet. He is seen as a de facto deputy prime minister or ‘supper minister’ with his overwhelming portfolio across three key ministries of Interior, Security and Community Development in the previous government of President Pierre Nkurunziza but was merged into a single ministry by President Evariste and given to Ndirakobuca.

Ciliary neurotrophic factor is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CNTF gene. CNTF is a neurotrophic factor that is produced by the ciliary body, and it has potent anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities. CNTF has been shown to promote the survival and growth of neural cells in vitro and in vivo, and it has been shown to be beneficial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.

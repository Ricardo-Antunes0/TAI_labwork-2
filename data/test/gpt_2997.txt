United Center is an indoor arena on the Near West Side of Chicago. The arena is the home of the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL) and the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA).  Built in 1994, United Center replaced the Chicago Stadium, which was torn down to make way for it. The arena is named after United Airlines, which donated $10 million to the project. The Blackhawks won their first Stanley Cup at United Center in 2010. The Bulls also won their first championship at United Center in 1995.

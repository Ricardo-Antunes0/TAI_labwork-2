Zhao Deyin  (died 892), formally the Prince of Huai'an , was a warlord late in the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, who initially served as a general under the pretender emperor Qin Zongquan.  When Qin neared defeat, Zhao declared loyalty to Tang instead, and was able to retain control of Zhongyi Circuit (忠義, headquartered in modern Xiangyang, Hubei), which, after his death, was passed to his son Zhao Kuangning. Background and service under Qin Zongquan  It is not known when Zhao Deyin was born.  His family was from Cai Prefecture (蔡州, in modern Zhumadian, Henan).  At some point, he became an officer under Qin Zongquan, who was then the Tang military governor (Jiedushi) of Fengguo Circuit (奉國, headquartered at Cai Prefecture).  When Qin was involved in the Tang forces' campaigns against the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao, Zhao had battlefield accomplishments and was rewarded by being made the prefect of Shen Prefecture (申州, in modern Xinyang, Henan).

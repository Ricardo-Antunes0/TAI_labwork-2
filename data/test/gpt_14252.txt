Bernal v. Fainter, 467 U.S. 216 (1984), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to provide tuition assistance to students who are unable to afford college.  The case was decided on February 4, 1984, and concerned an Arizona law that provided tuition assistance to students who were unable to afford college. The plaintiffs, a group of low-income students, argued that the law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court ruled in their favor, finding that the state was required to provide tuition assistance to students who were unable to afford college.

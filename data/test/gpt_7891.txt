A foldable smartphone (also known as a flexible phone, fabric phone, or rollable phone) is a mobile phone that can be rolled up into a small bundle or unrolled to its original size. As of early 2019, there are no commercially available foldable smartphones.  Foldable smartphones have been proposed as a potential solution to the problem of battery life on mobile devices. By being able to fold the screen in half or thirds, the size of the battery pack needed to power the device can be reduced. This could allow for devices that are thinner and lighter, and may be more suitable for use in tight spaces.  There are several competing technologies for foldable smartphones. One approach is to use a flexible screen that can be rolled up like a poster. Another is to use a flexible body that can be folded into different shapes.  While foldable smartphones have been proposed as a potential solution to several problems with current mobile devices, there are still many hurdles to overcome before they become a reality. Among these are developing a flexible screen technology that is both durable and easy to use, and finding a way to power these devices without requiring large batteries.

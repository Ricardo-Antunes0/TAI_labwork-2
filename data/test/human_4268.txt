Chondrostei is a group of primarily cartilaginous fish showing some degree of ossification. The cartilaginous condition is thought to be derived, and the ancestors of this group were bony fish with fully ossified skeletons. Members of this group  share with the Elasmobranchii certain features such as the possession of spiracles, a heterocercal tail, and the absence of scales. Nevertheless, the fossil record suggests they have more in common with the teleosts. Chondrostei is probably a paraphyletic grouping, representing the primary radiation of bony fishes. A number of fossil groups are known, but the 52 living species are divided in only two orders, the Acipenseriformes (sturgeons and paddlefishes), and the Polypteriformes (reedfishes and bichirs). Characteristics The main distinguishing feature of this group is the cartilaginous nature of the skeleton, although some older fish show a degree of calcification. The ancestors of the chondrosteans are thought to be bony fish, but that this characteristic of an ossified skeleton was lost in later evolutionary development, resulting in a lightening of the frame. Elderly chondrostean individuals show beginnings of ossification of the skeleton, which suggests this process is delayed rather than wholly lost in these fishes. Their air-bladders are physostome.

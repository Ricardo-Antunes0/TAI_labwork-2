In coding theory, fountain codes (also known as discrete fountain codes) are a class of error-correcting codes. They are character-based, and can be used to encode messages of arbitrary length.  A fountain code is a code where each symbol corresponds to a certain set of symbols that are close in frequency. This allows for efficient decoding, since the decoder only needs to look for symbols that are nearby in frequency.  Fountain codes have several properties that make them well-suited for use in communication systems. First, they are easy to generate and code; this makes them suitable for use in low-bandwidth systems. Second, they are robust against errors; even if a small number of errors is introduced into the data, the fountain code can still correct them efficiently. Third, they are efficient in terms of the amount of information they can transmit; for example, a 1 bit message can be encoded using a fountain code with a capacity of 16 bits.

Personality is the characteristic sets of behaviors, thoughts, and feelings that an individual displays over a period of time. It can be described as an individual's unique way of interacting with the world.  Personality can be divided into five primary dimensions: neuroticism, introversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. These dimensions are not mutually exclusive and people often display more than one characteristic from each dimension. For example, a person who is neurotic may be outgoing and conscientious at the same time.  There is no one definitive definition of personality, because it is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by multiple factors. The five primary dimensions are only one example of the many ways that personality can be assessed.  Personality is believed to play a role in many aspects of an individual's life, including their relationships, job performance, and overall well-being. It is important to understand and manage your personality so that you can achieve your goals and live a fulfilling life.

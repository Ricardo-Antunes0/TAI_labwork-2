Harald Alfred Hauge (1876â€“1901) was a Norwegian painter. He is considered one of the most important representatives of the Skagen School.  Alfred Hauge was born in Kristiania (now Oslo), in 1876. He was the son of a clerk in the customs service. He showed an early interest in art, and started his career as a painter of landscapes and seascapes. In 1901, he committed suicide by shooting himself. His suicide was a result of mental illness, and his work has been largely ignored since his death. However, in recent years, there has been a revival of interest in his work.

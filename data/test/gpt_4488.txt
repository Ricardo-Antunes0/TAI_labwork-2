Cream ale is a style of American light ale. The term derives from the use of cream in the brewing process, giving the beer a light, fluffy texture.   Cream ale is brewed with a moderate amount of malt and hops, with the intention of producing a beer that is smooth and easy to drink. The style may be characterized by a slightly sweet taste, with a low bitterness level. Some variations of cream ale are made with added lactose or vanilla.

Stenotrophomonas is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria, which is considered a cosmopolitan pathogen. The genus is composed of a single species, S. maltophilia, which is the causative agent of maltreatment-associated diarrhoea (MAD).  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a Gram-negative bacterium that can cause maltreatment-associated diarrhoea (MAD) in humans. The bacterium is endemic to Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East and can be found in water and soil. It can be spread through contact with infected animals or their faeces, and can also be introduced into the environment through contaminated food or water. The bacterium has a wide range of host organisms, including humans, pigs, cattle, rabbits, and camels. In humans, the bacterium can cause infection in the small intestine and colon. The disease is typically caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium, but it can also be spread through respiratory secretions and blood.  There is no specific treatment for MAD, but antibiotics may be used to treat associated symptoms such as diarrhoea. Prevention of MAD is through safe food and water hygiene practices and frequent hand-washing.

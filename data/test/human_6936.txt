Nicholas Love, also known as Nicholas Luff, (died c. 1424) was first a Benedictine and then a  Carthusian monk in medieval England, and became the first prior  of Mount Grace charterhouse in Yorkshire.  He was the translator and reviser of a popular devotional treatise which was used by the Church authorities to counter the teaching of John Wycliffe. In his later years he convinced Henry V of England to attempt to reform Benedictine monasticism in England, but died before measures could be taken. Life as a Monk he spent his mature years as a Carthusian prior, he was originally a Benedictine monk, perhaps of  Freiston, a cell founded in 1114  of the Benedictine Crowland Abbey in Lincolnshire and which within a short time became a priory. As the first prior  of Mount Grace charterhouse, Love was preceded by three "rectors", as the Carthusian Order names the superiors of houses not yet formally incorporated (an early charter names Robert Tredwye, or Trethewy–the first rector–as first prior). Love was the fourth rector, promoted to prior upon the incorporation of Mount Grace in 1411. The latest documentary occurrence of his name is 15 March 1423, and his death, as "former prior" is recorded in 1424.

Snelgrove is a former hamlet in Brampton, Ontario, Canada, straddling the border between Brampton and Caledon, and centred on the intersection of Hurontario Street and Mayfield Road. It was known as Edmonton in the 1800s after home town of local settlers. The area's boundaries creates a deviation of the Brampton/Caledon boundary which is otherwise bisected by Mayfield Road, to include the entire community within Brampton, which was done when Chinguacousy Township was abolished and split between Brampton and Caledon in 1974. The western end is located at the Orangeville Brampton Railway railway tracks west of Robertson Davies Drive,  northern end just north of Collingwood Road / Highwood Road,  eastern end just east of Etobicoke Creek. Previously known as Edmonton,  it was renamed in 1880s by Canadian Pacific Railway to avoid confusion with another CPR stop in what is now Edmonton,  Alberta. The area's name is linked to the local Snell family (lead by John Snell and brothers whom settled in Chinguacousy Township in 1838).

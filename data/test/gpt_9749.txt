Peer support occurs when people provide knowledge, encouragement, and support to others in order to help them achieve their goals. It can be provided in person, over the phone, or online.  Peer support is beneficial for both the helper and the helped. The helper gains satisfaction from helping someone, while the helped receives support and encouragement to reach their goals. Peer support can also be helpful in preventing depression and anxiety.

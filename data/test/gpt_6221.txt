CUFA (Central Única das Favelas) is a Brazilian social movement that emerged in the 1990s, and is considered the largest and most influential favela-based organization in the country.  CUFA was founded in 1993 by José Mariano Beltrame, a former Catholic priest who had left the priesthood to work with the poor. Beltrame believed that the favelas could be transformed into centres of economic opportunity and social justice if they were given the same rights and opportunities as other Brazilian cities.  CUFA has played a leading role in many of Brazil's major political and social movements, including the fight for land reform, education reform, and AIDS awareness. It also operates several social programs in the favelas, including health clinics, food banks, and educational programs.  Today, CUFA is one of Brazil's most powerful social movements, with membership in the tens of thousands. It is also one of Brazil's most ethnically diverse organizations, with members from all over Brazil's vast landscape.

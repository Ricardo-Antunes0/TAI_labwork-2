Vasily Ivanovich Belov (; 23 October 1932 â€“ 30 March 2000) was a Russian physicist who made significant contributions to the fields of high-energy and nuclear physics.  Born in Leningrad, Belov earned his doctorate from the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1957, after which he worked at the Pulkovo Observatory. In 1973 he was appointed as a professor at the University of Moscow, where he remained until his death. He also held positions at the University of California, Berkeley and CERN.  Belov is known for his work on the physics of high-energy particles, including the study of cosmic ray particles and their interactions with atoms. He was also involved in research into the physics of nuclear reactors and the development of techniques for detecting nuclear weapons. Belov was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1984 for his work on cosmic ray particles and nuclear reactions.

Mangde Chhu or Tongsa river flows in the state of Sikkim in Northeast India. The river originates from the glaciers on the eastern slopes of the Langtang range in the Himalayas and flows for about 320 kilometres before entering the plains. The river is fed by several tributaries, most notably the Lachung, Khangchendzonga, and Rinchen rivers. It is noted for its scenic beauty and array of flora and fauna.  The Mangde Chhu basin has a total catchment area of 1,290 square kilometres which supports a population of around 100,000 people. The main economic activities involve agriculture, forestry and tourism. The Mangde Chhu valley is home to the endangered snow leopard and several rare bird species.

Wainwright Bank was a nationally recognized socially progressive bank in Boston, lauded as a "rebel with a cause making its reputation as a champion of social-justice causes, throwing its support behind everything from the gay-rights movement and affordable housing initiatives to immigration reform and the anti-Iraq war movement." There are 12 branch offices in Boston, Cambridge, Brookline, Newton, Watertown and Somerville. The current president is Jan A. Miller. Wainwright has made community development, affordable housing, civil and human rights, and other social issues a prominent focus of its activities and has a documented history of leadership in supporting social justice efforts. Wainwright was featured in three recent books on this topic: in 2005, Megatrends 2010: The Rise of Conscious Capitalism by Patrician Aburdene; in 2006, named as a “truly responsible and highly profitable firm that is changing business now” in The High Purpose Company by Christine Arena ; and in 2008 in the Soul of a Leader by Margaret Benefiel PhD, CEO of Executive Soul and a teacher of spirituality and leadership at Andover Newton Theological School. In June 2010 it was announced that Wainwright will be bought by the somewhat larger local regional Eastern Bank for $163 million.  The purchase is to be completed by the end of 2010. Wainwright branches, staff and community involvement are to continue, but the name will be dropped.  Senior Wainwright management will have positions with Eastern Bank.

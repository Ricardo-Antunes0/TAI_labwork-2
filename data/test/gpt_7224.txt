Pedro R. David was born in Villa Rica, Veracruz, on October 25, 1934. He is a Mexican artist whose work spans painting, sculpture, installation art, and video.  David was born into a poor family of modest means in Villa Rica, Veracruz. He initially began painting to escape the poverty and social injustices that he experienced. After completing his secondary education, he moved to Mexico City to study at the National School of Painting and Sculpture. There he encountered the work of Mexican muralists Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco, who had a profound influence on his art.  David's early works were figurative and expressive, but he soon began experimenting with new mediums, including sculpture and installation art. His 1970 piece "Tower of Briar" is an iconic example of his early video art. In the 1980s David began painting again, this time focusing on abstract expressionism.  David has been praised for his unique style and innovative approach to art. He has been exhibited in many countries around the world, including the United States, Spain, France, Japan, and Mexico. He has also received numerous awards, including the Premio Banamex de Artes Plásticas in 1995 and the prestigious National Prize for Arts and Letters in 2000. David currently resides in Mexico City.

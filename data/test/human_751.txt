Novelty piano is a genre of piano and novelty music that was popular during the 1920s. A successor to ragtime and an outgrowth of the piano roll music of the 1910s, novelty piano can be considered a pianistic cousin of jazz, which appeared around the same time. "Nola," a 1915 composition by New York pianist Felix Arndt, is generally considered the first novelty piano hit. Many early novelty composers were piano roll artists from the Chicago area, where two of the largest piano roll companies, QRS and Imperial, had their headquarters.  Though also often highly syncopated, it is distinct from stride piano, which was developed in New York at about the same time. Novelty piano influenced jazz. The earliest composers of novelty piano were piano roll artists looking to sell piano rolls. These pieces started out as highly complex rags with characteristic breaks, consecutive fourths, and advanced harmonies. The pioneer of this style was Charley Straight, whose compositions were issued on piano roll years before Confrey's novelty hits. Early Charley Straight novelties include "S'more," "Playmor," "Nifty Nonsense," "Rufenreddy," and "Wild And Wooly."

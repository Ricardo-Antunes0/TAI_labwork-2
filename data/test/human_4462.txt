Plot  The film starts with Khadeeja having emotionless sex with her husband and then he gets to his daily chores the moment he is satisfied, an implication of the tag line of the film where women are treated as a piece of flesh without giving any considerations to their emotions. Later she starts masturbating which she enjoys, to which her husband is annoyed and laments that her clitoris was not properly circumcised, again implying that women are forbidden from enjoying sex as per tenets of religion.

"She Needs Love" is a song written by Clint Ballard Jr., who wrote it as a single for Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders. It was the third and final song written by him that the group recorded, following "The Game of Love" and "It's Just a Little Bit Too Late". Upon release, the single only reached number 32 in the UK, which promted Fontana to pursue a solo career while the Mindbenders continued as a trio. Background and release  Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders had enjoyed a cross-atlantic hit with the song "The Game of Love", which topped the Billboard Hot 100 and reached number two in the UK's Record Retailer in mid-1965. The song was composed by Clint Ballard Jr., who with it proved that he could pursue a career in songwriting. Knowing that the Mindbenders had made it big, he offered them another of his compositions, "It's Just a Little Bit Too Late" which was released in the summer of 1965 and became a minor hit on both Billboard Hot 100 and Record Retailer. Unlike "The Game Of Love", "It's Just A Bit Too Late" failed to reach the top-ten, peaking at number twenty on the latter chart. This led to suspicion of the group becoming a one-hit wonder or eventually breaking up. In a last resort, they gave another Ballard Jr. composition a chance, this being "She Needs Love" being produced by Fontana Records house producer Jack Baverstock. The single was eventually released on 10 September 1965 through Fontana.

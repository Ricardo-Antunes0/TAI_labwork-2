The CVV1 Pinguino  was a single seat, high performance glider designed and built in Italy in the mid-1930s, the first of a series of gliders from the Milan Polytechnic. It did not go into production. Design and development The Pinguino was the first design from the Centro Volo a Vela (CVV), or Experimental Soaring Centre, of the Royal Polytechnic of Milan. Ermenegildo Preti was only eighteen when he began the design.  It was a wood and fabric aircraft, a cantilever, gull winged monoplane in the manner of the slightly earlier German DFS Rh√∂nsperber.  The mid mounted wing was built around a single spar with a plywood covered D-box ahead of it and fabric behind.  In plan, it had a constant chord centre section, filling about a third of the span, and outer sections with taper on both leading and trailing edges ending in semi-elliptical tips. The centre section had positive dihedral but there was none on the outer panels. Ailerons occupied the whole of these outer panels, hinged parallel to the trailing edge.  Short span airbrakes extended upwards only, mounted just behind the spar at the outer ends of the centre section.

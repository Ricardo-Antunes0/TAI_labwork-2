Caltha introloba, commonly known as the alpine marsh-marigold is a small (during flowering 1–2 cm high) hairless, perennial alpine herb, that is endemic to the alpine regions of Australia and Tasmania. Description   The alpine marsh-marigold is a small hairless, perennial alpine herb, with short, stout rhizomes, and forms dense mats. Its leaves have petioles of about 5 cm long with a leafblade that is oblong or lanceolate rounded triangular, 8–40 mm long, emarginate, with 2 lanceolate triangular appendages of 4–20 mm long on the upper surface. The flowering stem is 1–2 cm long, but grows to 5–10 cm when seeds are ripe. The five to eight sepals are between 10–22 mm long, white, but often tinged pink or purple, particularly at the base and the veins. Fifteen to thirty stamens with white or often pinkish filaments and yellow pollen encircle six to eighteen free carpels. When ripe, these have developed into follicles which are spreading, have short beaks and contain few seeds. Flowering occurs between November and December, often directly from under the receding snow.

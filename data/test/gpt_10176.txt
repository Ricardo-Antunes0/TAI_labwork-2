Chu Teh-Chun or Zhu Dequn (24 October 1883 â€“ 13 October 1936), was a Chinese general who played a significant role in the development of the National Revolutionary Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War. He was also instrumental in the founding of the Republic of China.  Born into a peasant family in Zhejiang province, Chu became a soldier in the Imperial Chinese Army during the Boxer Rebellion. He rose through the ranks, becoming a general during World War I before serving as commander of the Northern Expeditionary Force during the Chinese Civil War. After the Kuomintang's victory in that conflict, Chu was appointed Minister of Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army. In 1932, he was made president of the Republic of China, a position he held until his death three years later.

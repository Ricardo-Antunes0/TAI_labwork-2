Anxiety/aggression-driven depression (also known as 5-HT related depression, dysthymia, or major depressive disorder with anxiety features) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by persistent and excessive feelings of anxiety or depression that are related to the individual's experience of stress or anger.  The cause of anxiety/aggression-driven depression is unknown, but it is likely caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. People who are genetically predisposed to anxiety/aggression-driven depression are also more likely to experience other mental health disorders, such as bipolar disorder.  Anxiety/aggression-driven depression is a serious condition that requires treatment. Treatment options include medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes. If left untreated, anxiety/aggression-driven depression can lead to lasting damage to the individual's mental health and well-being.

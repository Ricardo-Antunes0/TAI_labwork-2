Madam Lindes Institut, was a Danish Girls' School. It was founded in 1883 by Marie Linde, who also served as its headmistress until her retirement in 1942. After her death, the school passed into the hands of the Danish state, which still maintains it as a school for girls aged 12-18.  Madam Lindes Institut is one of Denmark's oldest and most prestigious girls' schools. It has educated many of Denmark's leading businesswomen, politicians and cultural figures, including Anne-Dorthe Nørgaard, Merete Riisager and Inger Støjberg. The school is renowned for its strong academic tradition and its focus on creative and practical skills.  The school has a rich history and is steeped in Danish culture. It lies in the heart of Copenhagen's fashionable Valby district, close to some of Denmark's most famous attractions, such as Tivoli Gardens and Nyhavn. The school's facilities are among the best in Denmark, with state-of-the-art classrooms and laboratories.  The Madam Lindes Institut today remains one of Denmark's leading schools for girls, with a strong tradition of academic excellence and a focus on creativity and practical skills.

Taj El-Din Hamid Hilaly (alternatively spelt Tajeddin Hamid el-Halaly, Tajieddin Hamid el-Halaly, Tajiilady Hamid el-Halaly; born 1936) is an Egyptian Islamic theologian and academic who served as the Minister for Religious Affairs of Egypt from 1994 to 1997. He was also the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar from 1999 to 2004.   Hilaly is well known for his conservative positions on religious matters, which have led to him being labelled a "fundamentalist" by some observers. Hilaly has also been criticised for his support of militant Islamist groups, including al-Qaeda and Islamic Jihad. In February 2005, Hilaly was arrested in Cairo on charges of inciting sectarian violence. He was subsequently released on bail. In 2006, he was convicted of insulting Islam and sentenced to three years in prison. He was released in October 2009 after an appeal court overturned the conviction.  Hilaly holds a Doctorate in Theology from Cairo University.

Danish Camp is an Iron Age fortified settlement located in the municipality of Birker√∏d, Region Hovedstaden, Denmark. It was first settled in the late 8th century BC as part of the Jutland culture. The settlement was abandoned by the end of the 7th century AD.  The site was first excavated in the 1870s by Carl Christian Rafn and has since been extensively studied. The site consists of a number of circular ramparts measuring up to 9 m in diameter, a central square flanked by two smaller squares, and a number of small fortifications. There are also a number of burial mounds and a large number of pottery fragments.  The settlement is thought to have been occupied by a small group of warriors who were able to defend themselves against raids by larger groups. The site is significant because it provides evidence for the development of military culture in Denmark during the Iron Age.

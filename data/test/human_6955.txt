James McCluskey (1 November 1950 in Salsburgh – 14 November 2013) was a football referee from Scotland, who officiated in the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup and the final of UEFA Women's Euro 1991. A former footballer in the early 1970s before becoming an official, he refereed the 1990 Scottish League Cup Final, an Old Firm fixture in which Rangers defeated Celtic 2–1 at Hampden Park (leading a group of Celtic supporters to have him followed by a private investigator to uncover any bias towards their rivals), the 1993 Scottish Cup Final where Rangers beat Aberdeen 2–1 at Celtic Park, the 1993 Scottish League Cup Final at Celtic Park in which Rangers overcame Hibernian 2–1, and the 1994 Scottish League Cup Final won on penalties by Raith Rovers over Celtic at Ibrox Stadium. With the national cup finals being spread around those locations during the 1990s due to reconstruction work, this gave McCluskey the unique distinction of having refereed such matches at all three venues.

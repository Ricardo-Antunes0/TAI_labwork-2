The Council of Rome was a meeting of the leading bishops of the Roman Catholic Church, which took place in 1063. It aimed to resolve the Investiture Controversy, which had arisen over who would appoint bishops in the Holy Roman Church.  The Council of Rome was convened by Pope Leo IX and attended by representatives from across Europe. After several months of deliberation, the council issued a series of decrees that clarified the authority of bishops and sanctioned the practice of investiture. These decrees helped to end the Investiture Controversy and helped to solidify the power of the Catholic Church.

The Great Island Path was a major east-west land route across the middle of the United States in the 18th and early 19th centuries. It connected the major eastern ports of New York City and Boston, as well as the major western port of St. Louis, Missouri.  The Great Island Path was also known as the New England Road, the Old Post Road, or simply the Post Road. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961.

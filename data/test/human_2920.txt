The Seal of Niue, or the Public Seal of Niue, is the official seal of Niue. It was created in 1974 when Niue gained self-governing status and joined into free association with New Zealand. History Before 1974 Niue used the Coat of Arms of New Zealand. The Niue Constitution Act, passed in 1974, provided for a unique seal to be created for Niue. The Seal was to be held by the Speaker of the Niue Assembly and was to be used to authenticate public documents or to affirm the creation of new laws by the Cabinet of Niue. The Speaker is also responsible for ensuring that the Seal is not misused. All judicial notices in Niue are affixed with the Seal. In 1977, after a request from the Niue Assembly, the Parliament of New Zealand passed the Seal of New Zealand Act with an amendment relating to Niue to bring the design of the Public Seal of Niue into line with the other nations in the Realm of New Zealand. Before 2007 the Seal of Niue was used in Tokelau to confirm the passage of legislation. In 2007 the Tokelau Amendment Act 2007 was passed, which replaced the use of the Seal of Niue in Tokelau and substituted it with "under the hand of the Administrator of Tokelau".

Melvin James Berman (14 January 1915 – 20 February 1996), was a prominent land developer in Maryland. He was instrumental in the creation of Columbia, Maryland along with his development partner James Rouse. In 1932, Melvin J. Berman moved from DeFuniak Springs, Florida near the Alabama border to Howard County. He hitchhiked to Baltimore, working in the dairy business for his uncle. He met his first business partner, a dairy distributor, Arthur V. Robinson soon after. Berman partnered with his younger brother Wolford also. In 1952 the assets of Highland Farm#2 "Olney Acres" became available at auction. In November 1955 Robinson became a member of the Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers Association Inc. Robinson used the association money to purchase Olney Acres dairy farm in Howard County, Maryland from his partner Berman for $1,000,000. He hired Berman, and used company funds to buy additional property surrounding the farm while providing salaries to each other from the cooperative. Roberts then resold the properties to himself and his family, and resold them again to Aladdin Construction Corporation developer Joseph Martelleni, forming Hammond Village in the process. In 1961 Berman and Robinson also partnered on a second milk plant in New York. Robinson did not have to appear in trial for fraud, because he died in a takeoff crash his twin engine aircraft from Baltimore.

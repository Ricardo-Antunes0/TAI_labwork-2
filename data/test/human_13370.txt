Mortimer "Morty" Smith is one of the title characters, one of the five main characters and the secondary protagonist of the American  animated television series Rick and Morty. Created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, Morty is an anxious 14-year-old based on Michael J. Fox's Marty McFly from Back to the Future. Known for his awkward, anxious, second-guessing, and doubtful personality and low sense of self-esteem, the character has been well-received. He is the good-natured and impressionable grandson of  mad scientist Rick Sanchez, the son of Jerry and Beth Smith, and the younger brother of Summer Smith, who can be easily manipulated. Although referring to himself as Morty Smith C-137 in reference to the designation given to his grandfather by the Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks, in reference to his original universe, "C-137", whether this is his actual universe designation is unknown. Book 1 of the Rick and Morty comic series (comprising the first two volumes of the series) follows the Rick and Morty of Dimension C-132 while most issues of subsequent installments follow the Rick and Morty of "C-137"; the video game Pocket Mortys follows the Rick and Morty of C-123, while various other Mortys are the focus of episodes set in the inter-dimensional Citadel of Ricks and Mortys, ruled by President Morty. Colloquially known unofficially as "Evil Morty" among fans and the media and previously referred to officially as Eyepatch Morty and Candidate Morty, President Morty has received a positive critical reception, praised for his iconic mind control eyepatch and outwardly calm and understanding, yet inwardly cunning and ruthless demeanor.

The Trump peace plan, officially titled "Peace Plan for the Middle East" is an outline of proposals by U.S. President Donald Trump to end the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict.  The Trump peace plan was first mentioned by Trump in a speech to the Arab Islamic American Summit on May 22, 2017. He outlined three points: creating an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, ending the refugee crisis, and moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  On June 6, 2017, Trump released a more detailed proposal on social media. It includes the following points:   - Recognizing Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state with secure and recognized borders  - Settling the refugee problem through funding a development program in Palestine that would allow refugees to return home and create jobs  - Restarting negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which would result in two states living side by side in peace and security

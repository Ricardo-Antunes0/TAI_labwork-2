Key pattern is the generic term for a repeating sequence of keys in a piece of music.  Key pattern can be found in many styles of music, from classical to pop. They can be used to create a sense of unity or cohesion between different parts of the music, or to set a specific mood.  Some examples of key patterns include the twelve notes of the major and minor scales, the chords in a song, and the notes in a melody.

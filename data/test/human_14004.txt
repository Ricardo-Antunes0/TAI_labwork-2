Choe Yun-ui was a Korean politician, publisher, and writer during the Goryeo Dynasty. Choe Yun-ui compiled the Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun  (Hangul : 상정예문, hanja : 詳定禮文) with another 16 scholars. They collected all courtesies from ancient to present and published 50 copies. The publication of the Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun was very important for the Goryeo dynasty, because it established the system of official uniforms  (that was still evolving at the time, during the 12th century), and thus the vertical rank of officials from king to subjects, specially during rituals. This was done to try to prevent conflicts of authority, and social unrest. Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun was published with movable metal type between 1234 and 1241. Yi Gyu-bo wrote postscript on behalf of Choi Yi which show how this book was published with movable metal type. According to this postscript, Choe Yi's father, Choe Chung-heon edited this book again because an older book lost some pages and the letters were unreadable. After he edited it, he copied two books and kept one copy in his home. Another book was kept in Yegwan, a unique research facility of Goryeo dynasty. By the time of the invasion of Mongol, he moved to Ganghwado and brought one copy of this book with him. Later, Cho Yi published 28 copies of this book with movable metal type and sent them to be kept in several local governments' offices.

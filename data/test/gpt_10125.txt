Sequencing by hybridization is a class of sequencing methods that use the principles of molecular genetics to sequence DNA or RNA molecules. The method works by combining the sequencing methods of PCR and Sanger sequencing, and is typically used tosequence long DNA or RNA molecules.   Sequencing by hybridization is a relatively new sequencing method, and has not yet been fully adopted into the mainstream of molecular biology research. However, the method has proven to be powerful and versatile, and has been used to sequence a wide range of DNA and RNA molecules. The method is particularly useful for sequencing long DNA or RNA molecules, as it can overcome some of the limitations of other sequencing methods.

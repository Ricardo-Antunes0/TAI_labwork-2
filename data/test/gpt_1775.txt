Paranthodon  is a genus of stegosaurian dinosaurs that lived during the Late Jurassic period. The type species is P. antirrhopus.  The majority of known specimens of Paranthodon date to the Kimmeridgian-Tithonian stage of the Late Jurassic period, around 156-150 million years ago. The genus is known from a total of eleven specimens, all from the Antler Formation in Wyoming. The majority of these specimens are incomplete or crushed, and some lack skull bones altogether. However, enough remains have been recovered to give a fairly detailed picture of the animal's morphology.  Paranthodon was a large and heavily built stegosaurian, with a long tail and short neck. It had a small head, short horned spikes on its head, and prominent frills on its back. Its body was covered in large plates of bone, which were arranged in an overlapping fashion. These plates may have served as armor, or may have been used for thermoregulation. Paranthodon was probably an herbivore, feeding on plants that grew on the ground.

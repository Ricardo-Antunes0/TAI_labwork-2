The Two Romanian Dances (Két Román Tánc) are a popular folk dance form of Romania. The dances are characterized by their syncopated rhythms and lively footwork. They are usually performed to music with a spirited tempo, and have been described as energetic and fun.  The Two Romanian Dances are believed to have originated in the region around Câmpulung Moldovenesc, in the early 19th century. They first became popular among the peasantry, and later spread to urban areas. Today, they are performed by both professional and amateur dance groups throughout Romania.  The Two Romanian Dances are usually performed to traditional Romanian music, which features a variety of styles including brass bands, reed instruments, and folk drums. Some modern adaptations of the Two Romanian Dances incorporate elements of pop music.

The PAL-TIN (Participarea TINerilor la Administrarea Locala, Transporturilor si Infrastructurii Nationale) program was launched in 2003 and is intended to support the development of the local transportation infrastructure by mobilizing private sector investment.  The PAL-TIN program is a Romanian government initiative that facilitates the involvement of private sector investment in the development of the country's local transportation infrastructure. The program is divided into three phases, with the first phase running from 2003 to 2005. The second phase, which began in 2006, focuses on the development of public transportation infrastructure. The third and final phase, which began in 2007, is aimed at developing the country's highway infrastructure.  PAL-TIN has been praised for its innovative approach to public-private partnerships. The program has also been credited with helping to revive Romania's faltering transportation sector.

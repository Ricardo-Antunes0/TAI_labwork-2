David George "Duke" Zeibert (1910 â€“ August 25, 1975) was an American jazz trumpeter.  Zeibert was born in Los Angeles, California, and began playing the trumpet at an early age. He played in Dixieland bands before moving to New York City in the 1930s, where he played with such jazz luminaries as Benny Goodman, Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, and Art Tatum. He also worked with bebop pioneer Miles Davis and his group, thelonious Monk. Zeibert is perhaps best known, however, for his work with the Duke Ellington Orchestra. He played on virtually every Ellington record from 1939 to 1974 and recorded more than 50 albums with the orchestra. Zeibert died of a heart attack in 1975.

Indian Island Light is a lighthouse on Indian Island in the Chesapeake Bay. The light was first lit on September 10, 1870. The current light is a white light in a red octagonal tower.  Indian Island is located in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay and is part of St. Mary's County, Maryland. The island is about long and wide. The lighthouse is located on the eastern side of the island, near the eastern end.  The lighthouse was first built by the United States Coast Guard in 1870 as a replacement for an earlier light that had been destroyed by a storm. It was initially lit with a single light in a small tower. In 1907, a new light tower was built and the original light was replaced with a second light. In 1966, the original light was replaced with a modern LED light.

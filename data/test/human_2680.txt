There have been several bands called The Ardells. Steve Miller's Band The Ardells was a band started by Steve Miller in 1961 when he attended the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. In the fall of 1962, Steve lived in a rooming house at 515 North Henry St. in Madison and also pledged the Chi Psi fraternity on fraternity row near Langdon St. Steve taught another fellow student, Jos Davidson, to play rhythm guitar and then bass, and formed a campus band: Steve Miller and the Ardells. Steve was featured on guitar, vocals and harp, and played a version of Texas shuffle blues that hadn't been heard in the upper Midwest. Also featured in the band were a local 16-year-old high school piano player named Brian Friedman, and Ron Boyer, a drummer who worked a day job as a manager in a local Kelly's Hamburger drive-in. The band played mostly the University party circuit, plus a few gigs in Madison and local clubs and a couple of concerts and the Dane County Fairgrounds. Later, Davidson joined Corky Siegel and Jim Schwall and was the bassist for the Siegel-Schwall Band from 1964 to 1967.

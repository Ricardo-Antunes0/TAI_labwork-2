Jaime Francisco Sebastián Castillo Petruzzi, known as Torito (Little Bull), is a Chilean former militant of the left-wing organization Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria who worked with the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement during the internal conflict in Peru. He was convicted by a Peruvian military tribunal of high treason in 1993 and sentenced to life in prison. In 2003, after a new trial in accordance with a ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Castillo was sentenced to 23 years in prison. He was released on 14 October 2016 and expelled to Chile. Associations and joining the MRTA   Castillo joined the MIR in the 1960s. After the victory of Salvador Allende, he was employed by the Government, sent to Cuba to train, and eventually became a guard of the Palacio de La Moneda. In 1973, immediately after Augusto Pinochet's coup d'état he fled to Paris to study. In the University of Paris he met fellow students, future MRTA leader Víctor Polay Campos and ex-president of Perú, Alan García. From Paris, he traveled to El Salvador and fought in the civil war there for two years. After this, he went to Nicaragua to aid the government in fighting Contra rebels supported and armed by the CIA (USA). Around 1987, the military failure and numerous inside political differences that plagued the MRTA led Polay to contact Castillo and urge him to go to Peru and join his organization.

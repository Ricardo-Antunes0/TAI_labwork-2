Lundin Peak is a summit located in King County of Washington state. It's part of the Cascade Range and is within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Lundin Peak is situated three miles north of Snoqualmie Pass on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Originally called Snoqualmie Little Sister, the peak's name was changed in 1931 to honor district forest ranger John Lundin. Lundin Peak is a high point on a ridge located midway between Snoqualmie Mountain and Red Mountain. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Snoqualmie River. Climate Lundin Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.

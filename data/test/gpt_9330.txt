In the largest combined arms battle of the war, United Nations forces led by General Douglas MacArthur defeated the Chinese People's Liberation Army and North Korean Army. The battle resulted in a UN victory and an end to the Korean War.  The Battle of Noryang was fought over a forty-seven day period from July 27, 1953 to September 15, 1953. The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) and North Korean Army had invaded South Korea in an effort to unify the Korean Peninsula under Communist rule. The UN forces, including American, British, Canadian, French and Australian troops, were deployed to repel the invasion.  The battle began with a Chinese attack on UN forces near the village of Osan. The PLA was initially successful in pushing back the UN forces, but they were eventually pushed back into a small pocket near Noryang. Over the next forty-seven days, UN forces gradually regained ground and eliminated Chinese and North Korean forces from the area around Noryang. By September 15, 1953, all Chinese and North Korean forces had been eliminated from the battlefield.  The Battle of Noryang was one of the largest combined arms battles of the Korean War. It involved more than 650,000 troops from both sides. The battle resulted in a UN victory and an end to the Korean War.

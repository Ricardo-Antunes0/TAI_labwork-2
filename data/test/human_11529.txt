Raúl del Cristi Gómez Jattin (31 May 1945 – 22 May 1997) was an influential Colombian poet. Life  Gómez Jattin was born in Cartagena, Colombia, to journalist Joaquín Pablo Gómez Reynero and Lola Jattin. His mother was of Lebanese, and Syrian ancestry. He spent most of his childhood in the town of Cereté, and then sent to his maternal grandmother in Cartagena, where he finished his secondary education. His father possessed a large library, and Gómez Jattin became an avid reader from a very young age, which was helped by his asthma. After spending a few years as a secondary education teacher in Cereté, he moved to Bogota, in 1964, to obtain a degree in law from Universidad Externado, under pressure by his father. It was in this university where he first came into contact with theatre, becoming part of the university's experimental theatre group, and where he started to write poetry first.

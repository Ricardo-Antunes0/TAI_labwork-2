Plot and synopsis In the New York City, 1976. Duane Lewis is a cook at a hamburger joint. Whenever he hears disco music, he literally goes into a trance. The day he loses his job, he comes across a young roller-skater in the park who, hoping to console him, invites him to a night out at the discotheque Seventh Heaven. Bombarded by decibels, Duane’s trance state quickly degenerates into homicidal mania. The girl who brought him there soon enough bitterly regrets her invitation… Upon waking up the next morning, Duane hops on the first plane to Montreal, using a stolen passport. Four years later, he’s altered his identity. He now answers to the name of Martin, and works as an audio-visual tech at a private school for teenage girls. He wears special gear to cut out external sounds, and his employers imagine him to be hard of hearing. As a long weekend approaches, two of the school’s students elect to hide out there so they can spend the weekend in the building alone. Alone with Duane. Their secret disco party has horrible consequences as Duane’s murderous madness reaches its peak level and he now has several potential victims in his sights. Meanwhile, a lieutenant detective from New York believes he has figured out the serial killer’s modus operandi and he links up with the Montreal police force to track down the murderer.

In Christianity, the Logos  is a figure of speech used by early Christians to refer to the divine principle in creation. It is also used to refer to the Christian concept of the Son of God as the embodiment of that principle.  The word logos comes from the Greek word logos, meaning "word, reason, discourse". Used in this sense, it refers to the creative power or principle behind all things. The New Testament speaks of this power as the breath of God (John 1:3), and as the Word of God (John 1:1). In Trinitarian theology, the Logos is considered to be the first and most fundamental of the Three Persons in Holy Trinity.  Early Christians used the term Logos to refer not just to this divine power but also to Jesus Christ himself. In John 1:1-3, for example, John tells us that the Logos (or "Word") who came into existence at the beginning of time was also equal with God in essence and in power. As the Son of God, Christ is therefore considered to be the embodiment of the divine Logos.

The Karoliina Rantamäki Award  is an ice hockey trophy awarded by the Finnish Ice Hockey Association to the playoff MVP of the Naisten Liiga. During 1982 to 2017, the league was called the Naisten SM-sarja. The Naisten SM-sarja Playoff MVP trophy was first awarded in the 1999–2000 season and the first recipient was forward Kati Kovalainen of the Espoo Blues Naiset. The most Karoliina Rantamäki Awards won by a single player is three, a record rather appropriately held by HIFK Naiset captain Karoliina Rantamäki. Rantamäki was recognized as the Naisten SM-sarja Playoff MVP in 2001, 2005, and 2007, all while playing with the Espoo Blues Naiset. The Playoff MVP award was named after Rantamäki in the 2010–11 season. Of the ten players with Naisten Liiga trophies named in their honor, she is the only player to hold the most wins of her eponymous award. Rantamäki also holds the record for most Marianne Ihalainen Awards won, with six, and most Tiia Reima Awards won, with eight.

The Temple of Edfu is an Egyptian temple on the outskirts of the city of Edfu. It is dedicated to the god Horus and is the most important temple in Upper Egypt.  The temple was built during the Middle Kingdom and consists of three parts: a main structure, a hypostyle hall, and a small structure at the back of the hall. The main structure is made up of three aisles, with small chapels on either side. The hypostyle hall is decorated with reliefs of animals and figures, as well as columns with capitals of alternating depictions of Horus and Set. The back structure contains a small shrine to Hathor.

Margaret of Città di Castello (1287 – October 13, 1352) was queen consort of Edward II by marriage to the English king from 1307 until his deposition in 1327.  Margaret was the daughter of Alfonso III of Aragon and Eleanor of England, daughter of Henry III of England. She was married in 1307 to Edward II, who had recently succeeded to the English throne as a child following the death of his father, Edward I. She remained with her husband during his reigns as king of England (1307–1327) and queen consort (1327–1377), although her influence was largely confined to the domestic sphere.  As queen consort, Margaret became known for her patronage of arts and literature. She also played a significant role in arranging her husband's marriages, including that of their eldest son, Edward, Earl of Lancaster, to Joan of Kent in 1318. The couple had six children together: Isabella, Edward III, Richard II, Joan of Kent, Edmund de Mortimer and Margaret. Margaret died aged about 74 years in 1352.

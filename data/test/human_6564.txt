The Unter, formerly Untermann, nicknamed the Wenzel, Wenz or Bauer, and (in Swiss) also called the Under, is the court card in German and Swiss-suited playing cards that corresponds to the Jack in French decks. The name Unter (lit.: "under") is an abbreviation of the former name for these cards, Untermann, which meant something like 'subordinate' or 'vassal'. Van der Linde argues that the King, Ober and Unter in a pack of German cards represented the military ranks of general, officer (Oberofficier) and sergeant (Unterofficier), while the pip cards represented the common soldier. The Unter is distinguished from the Ober (lit. "over", formerly Obermann) by the fact that the suit sign is located in the lower part of the image on single-headed cards or in the centre of the image on double-headed cards. Unters or Unterm√§nner were described soon after the introduction of playing cards in Europe. In 1377, John of Rheinfelden wrote that the lowest court card was a marshal (cavalry commander) who held his suit sign hanging down. It is likely that the horses were dropped to simplify production in the late 14th or early 15th centuries. In the Spanish deck, jacks are known as sota which also means "under", a vestigial remnant of their common origin.

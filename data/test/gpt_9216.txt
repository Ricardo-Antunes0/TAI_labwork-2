Stenoma amphitera is a moth in the Depressariidae family. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1928. It is found in Peru.  The wingspan is about 16Â mm. The forewings are brown, with some scattered black scales, the costa from the base to one-third suffused with black, the dorsum anteriorly rather broadly suffused with whitish and with a broad streak from the base to two-thirds, becoming strongly curved anteriorly near the base, its end somewhat before the middle, then abruptly bent downwards and reaching two-thirds of the costa before curving again towards the costa posteriorly. There is a triangular black spot on the costa beyond one-third and a minute black dot on the dorsum near the base. The hindwings are whitish ochreous.

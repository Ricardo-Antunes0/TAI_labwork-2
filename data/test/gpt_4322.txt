Baillival Castle (Surpierre) is a bailiff's castle located in the municipality of Surpierre, in the Jura department of France.  The castle was built in the 12th century by Walter de Baillival, bailiff of the counts of Nevers. The bailliage of Surpierre was created in 1292 and the castle became its seat. The bailliage was abolished in 1790 and the castle sold to a private owner. It has since been restored and is now open to the public.  The castle is a large quadrangular structure with four towers at each corner. The central tower is higher than the others and is flanked by two smaller towers. The walls are made of polygonal masonry and are surrounded by a moat. The castle has been extensively modified over the years, but some of its original features remain, such as the Romanesque doorways and windows.

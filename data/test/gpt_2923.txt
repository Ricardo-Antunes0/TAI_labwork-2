John Chapman (1801â€“1854) was an English engineer and railway pioneer. He was the designer and builder of the world's first commercially successful steam locomotive, the Rocket.  Chapman was born in 1801 in Bristol, England, the son of a weaver. He had no formal education, but taught himself engineering and mechanics. He began working as a mechanic for the Bristol and Gloucester Railway in 1825. In 1830, he designed and built his first locomotive, a small 2-2-2 locomotive named The Rocket. The Rocket proved to be a success and Chapman was soon employed by several other railways.  In 1832, Chapman designed and built the first locomotive to use coal gas as fuel. This locomotive, named The Miner, used gas generated by coal burning in its boiler to power its engine. This invention made coal gas an important source of power for railways and revolutionized railway transportation.  Chapman also developed several other railway technologies during his career. He designed and built the first rail suspension bridge, the Clifton Suspension Bridge in 1836. He also developed the first railway safety regulations and established the first railroad engineering school. John Chapman died in 1854 after a short illness.

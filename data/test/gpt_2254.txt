Jacques de Cambrai (fl. c. 1260â€“80), sometimes known as Jacques de la Cambrai, was a French nobleman and soldier who played a significant role in the Hundred Years' War.  Jacques de Cambrai was born into a family of great wealth and power in the county of Cambrai in northern France. He served King Louis IX of France as a soldier, and rose through the ranks to become one of the most experienced and skilled commanders in the king's army. In 1265, he participated in an unsuccessful attempt to capture Andalusia from the Muslims. The following year, he led an army into Spain to help the French forces besieged at Pamplona. In 1268, he captured Burgos after a long siege. In 1271, he participated in the Battle of La Forbie, which marked the end of the first phase of the Hundred Years' War. In 1272, he was appointed governor of Languedoc.  In 1277, Cambrai was appointed commander of the royal army in Gascony. In 1279, he led an expedition into England to help King Edward I defeat Simon de Montfort. The following year, he participated in the Battle of Bouvines, which decisively ended the war. After Bouvines, Cambrai retired from active military service and returned to his estates in France. He died sometime between 1280 and 1284.

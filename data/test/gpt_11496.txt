Pseudomonas oryzihabitans is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes soybean blight. It is a facultative anaerobic and strictly aerobic bacterium which can grow in both acidic and alkaline environments. The bacterium was first isolated from soybean plants in Japan in 1908, and was later found to cause the same disease in other legumes, such as alfalfa, clover, and beans. Soybean blight is the most serious disease of soybeans, and is responsible for losses of up to 50% of the world's soybean crop.

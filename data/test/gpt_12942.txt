Saide Arifova (1916 – 9 September 2007) was a Bulgarian opera singer.  Born in 1916 in the town of Yambol, Arifova began her vocal training at the age of six with her mother. She soon switched to the operatic stage, making her debut in 1938 at the National Opera of Sofia as Donna Anna in Don Giovanni. She quickly gained a reputation as a leading mezzo-soprano, performing both bel canto and verismo works. Her first major international success came in 1951 with the role of Gilda in Rigoletto, for which she was awarded the prestigious Liceo Musicale di Bologna Prize.  A regular performer on the opera stages of Europe and North America throughout her career, Arifova notably appeared at La Scala, Covent Garden, the Metropolitan Opera and the Royal Opera House Covent Garden. She also made guest appearances at the Vienna State Opera, the Royal Opera House Stockholm, the Teatro Colón Buenos Aires and Teatro Regio di Parma. In 1975 she received a Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Performance for her rendition of "Nessun dorma" from Puccini's Tosca.  Arifova retired from performing in 1978 but continued to work as a voice teacher until her death in 2007. She was posthumously awarded Bulgaria's highest honour, the Order of National Unity.

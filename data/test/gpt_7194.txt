The 5th Pri-Amur Corps  was a corps-sized military unit of the Soviet Union's Ground Forces. It was formed in 1944 as a result of the merging of the 3rd Pri-Amur Corps and the 85th Rifle Division. The corps fought in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945 and in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol. In 1956 its elements were transferred to the newly formed 27th Army.

Soyuz 7K-OK No.1 was an uncrewed spacecraft, launched by a Soyuz-U carrier rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on March 23, 1966, to become the first manned spacecraft to orbit the earth without landing on the moon.  The spacecraft was commanded by Vladimir Komarov and carried three astronauts: Yury Gagarin, Aleksei Leonov, and myself. After a voyage of almost six hours, we entered Earth's orbit and began a nine-day journey around the planet. Finally, on March 27, we arrived at the Soviet Union's Salyut 1 space station, where Gagarin became the first person to fly in space twice.

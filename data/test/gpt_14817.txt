Image theatre is a performance technique in which theatrical images are projected on a screen or other surface in order to create an immersive experience for the audience.  Image theatre has been used in mythology, religion, and folklore, as well as in film and television. It has been described as a "primitive form of cinema", and has been used to tell stories across many cultures.

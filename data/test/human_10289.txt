Anita Doron (born June 3, 1974) is a Hungarian-Canadian film director, screenwriter, producer, cinematographer, author, and a 2010 TED Fellow. Doron is best known for her 2012 film adaptation of the 1996 novel The Lesser Blessed, written by Canadian author Richard Van Camp. Early life   Doron was born in Transcarpathia, a region of the former USSR. Her family members were high altitude mountaineers and they often spent summers in the mountainous regions of Georgia and Armenia. On her TED personal profile, Doron discloses that her parents' ideologies influenced her own way of life early on. She states: "My mother rejected the official truth handed down by the government and my father refused the reality accepted by the middle class, leading me to seek and witness alternative truths from an early age." At age 15, Doron was almost "sold into marriage for 200 sheep in remote Uzbekistan." However, the deal fell through when her father realized he could not transport the sheep in his airplane.

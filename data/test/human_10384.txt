The Karakol society , was a Turkish clandestine intelligence organization that fought on the side of the Turkish National Movement during the Turkish War of Independence. Formed in November 1918, it refused to merge itself with Association for the Defense of the Rights of Anatolia and Rumelia under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Its leadership was decapitated in the aftermath of the 1920 Turkish Grand National Assembly election, leading to its eventual dissolution in 1926. Operation The Karakol Society, also known as the Black Arm, Sentinel Association  or Guard Society, was founded in November 1918, as the first clandestine organization fighting against the Allied Occupation of Constantinople. It served as a continuation of the Committee of Union and Progress' intelligence agency, the Special Organization, with the majority of its members coming from the latter. It was founded by Kara Vâsıf Bey and Kara Kemal on Talaat Pasha's orders, soon after he fled the country. The name was chosen on the grounds that it was the amalgamation of the founder's names; a secret password (K.G.) was also adopted. Karakol's central committee consisted of Kara Vâsıf Bey, Baha Said Bey, Refik Ismail Bey, Ali Riza Bey (Bebe), Edip Servet Bey (Tör), Kemalletin Sami Bey, and Galatali Sevket Bey. The aims of the organization were outlined as protecting and, where non existent, establishing national unity through legitimate means behind the scenes. Revolutionary action was to be taken in the case of oppressors of freedom and justice. The third article of the declaration of establishment highlighted Karakol's socialist nature.

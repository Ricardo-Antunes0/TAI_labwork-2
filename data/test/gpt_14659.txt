Punctelia borreri is a species of foliose lichen that grows on coniferous trees in the Northern Hemisphere. It was first described in 1794 by Carl Linnaeus.  P. borreri is typically a dark green, olive-black, or brownish foliose lichen, growing to a height of 1â€“2 cm. The surface is covered with small, closely packed, branched thalli, each with a central pore. The thalli are attached to the substrate by a network of fine silica strands.  This species is commonly found on Norway spruce and other conifers in North America, Europe, and Asia. It is also found on the bark of deciduous trees in warm temperate and subtropical regions.

The Synopsis Chronike  is a 13th-century Byzantine chronicle, a history of the Byzantine Empire written in an admiring but largely uncritical style by one of its historians. It covers the period from the accession of Andronikos II Palaiologos in 1282 to 1296.  The work is divided into five books, covering the reigns of Andronikos II and his three sons, Theodore I Laskaris, John VI Kantakouzenos, and Manuel I Komnenos. The author is unknown, but appears to be an insider or courtier. He writes with admiration for his subjects and with a strong bias in their favour. He relies heavily on eyewitness accounts, often uncritically repeating stories that he has heard from others. He also draws on contemporary chronicles, such as the "Chronicle of John Malalas", and official documents.  The work is valuable for its detailed description of political and military events, as well as for its analysis of economic and social developments. However, it is generally inaccurate and unreliable, and sometimes presents false or exaggerated accounts of events.

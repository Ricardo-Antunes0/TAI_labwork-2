Harlekin (Harlequin) is a composition for unaccompanied male voice and orchestra by the German composer Richard Strauss, first performed in Munich on 8 November 1874.  The character of Harlekin is loosely based on the medieval jester known as Harlequin. Strauss composed the work for a performance by the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, but it was not premiered until nearly a year after his death. The work is scored for a solo voice and orchestra.  The piece is structured in three sections: an introduction, a ballad, and a finale. The introduction features harpsichord and celesta solos, while the ballad features a solo baritone with accompaniment from strings and woodwinds. The finale features an extended coda featuring woodwinds, brass, and percussion.  Harlekin has been frequently performed throughout the world and has been recorded numerous times. It is frequently performed as part of the annual "Richard Strauss Festival" in Salzburg.

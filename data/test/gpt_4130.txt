Cuneah, also Gunia, Cunneah, Cunnyha, Cunniah, Coneehaw, is a town in the state of West Virginia, United States. As of the 2000 census, the population was 3,585.  The town is located on the eastern edge of the Allegheny Plateau at an elevation of 3,000 feet (914 m). The Coneehawn River flows through the town.  The first Europeans to visit Cuneah were members of a 1755 expedition led by George Washington. They named the settlement Gunia after the local Shawnee chief Gunia. The town was laid out in 1809 by General Solomon Meredith and was named for his wife, Cuneah.  Cuneah was incorporated as a town in 1810. It became a center for coal and iron mining during the late 19th century. The town's economy declined in the early 21st century, and it has since experienced population decline.  Cuneah is home to West Virginia University's School of Medicine and Health Sciences, which opened in 1966.

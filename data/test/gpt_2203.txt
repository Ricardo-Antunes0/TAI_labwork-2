Hedvig Ulrika Taube (31 October 1714 – 5 December 1786) was a Swedish composer, singer and pianist. She is best known for her operas, most notably "The Daughter of the Regiment" and "Elektra".  Taube was born in Stockholm to a musician family. Her father, Ulrik Taube, was a violinist and her mother, Hedvig Catharina Skogsberg, was a singer and composer. At the age of six, she began taking piano lessons from Carl Fredrik Händel. In 1729, she made her stage debut in the opera "Almira" in Copenhagen.  In 1736, she married the actor Carl Gustaf Pilon and moved to Dresden, where she became active as a performer and teacher. Pilon died five years later, leaving her with two young daughters. Taube returned to Sweden in 1741 and continued performing there until her death. She composed works for vocal and chamber ensemble, as well as songs and piano pieces.  Taube is considered one of the most important figures in Swedish music history. Her works have been performed throughout Europe and she has been cited as an influence by composers such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven.

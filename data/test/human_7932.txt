A dental aerosol is an aerosol that is produced from dental instrument, dental handpieces, three-way syringes, and other high-speed instruments. These aerosols may remain suspended in the clinical environment. Dental aerosols can pose risks to the clinician, staff, and other patients. The heavier particles (e.g., >50 µm ) contained within the aerosols are likely to remain suspended in the air for relatively short period and settle quickly onto surfaces, however, the lighter particles may remain suspended for longer periods and may travel some distance from the source. These smaller particles are capable of becoming deposited in the lungs when inhaled and provide a route of diseases transmission. Different dental instruments produce varying quantities of aerosol, and therefore are likely to pose differing risks of dispersing microbes from the mouth. Air turbine dental handpieces generally produce more aerosol, with electric micromotor handpieces producing less, although this depends on the configuration of water coolant used by the handpiece. Composition  These dental aerosols are bioaerosols which may be contaminated with bacteria, fungi, and viruses from the oral cavity, skin, and the water used in dental units. Dental aerosols also have micro-particles from dental burs, and silica particles which are one of the components of dental filling materials like dental composite. Depending upon the procedure and site, the aerosol composition may change from patient to patient. Apart from microorganisms, these aerosols may consist of particles from saliva, gingival crevicular fluid, blood, dental plaque, calculus, tooth debris, oronasal secretions, oil from dental handpieces, and micro-particles from grinding of the teeth and dental materials. They may also consist of abrasive particles that are expelled during air abrasion and polishing methods.

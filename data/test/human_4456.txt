The Challenger mine is a gold mine in the Far North of South Australia, 165 km west of the Stuart Highway and 740 km north-west of Adelaide. It was operated by Dominion,  Kingsgate and then WPG Resources. The mine is now on Care and Maintenance. The deposit was named by the geologist who discovered it (David Edgecombe), after his dog. History The ore body was discovered in early 1995 by Dominion Mining Ltd. It was found by using the relatively new (at that time) method of sampling calcrete (calcium carbonate laterite). Broad sample spacing of 800m fortuitously "snagged" the sub-surface orebody with a single high gold in calcrete value attracting almost immediate follow-up. The top of the orebody was beneath less than metre of transported cover and calcrete. Exploration drilling commenced in mid-1995 and continued for several years on a campaign basis. The initial drilling programs intersected high grade ore but were unable to consistently hit the ore zones at depth. Further drilling and detailed structural interpretation of the drill core lead to the orebody being defined as several tightly folded linear shoots, plunging at about a 45 degree angle. As yet, the bottom of the ore body has not been discovered, although there are several faults offsetting the orebody. The project was Joint-ventured with Samantha-Resolute in late 1995. Activities stopped during the late 1990s while Dominion negotiated to buy back Resolute's share of the project and then find another Joint-venture partner. Dominion was unable to find a Joint-venture partner and so in 2001 the company decided to develop the mine itself.  The mine was initially an open pit, commencing in 2002 and converted to underground mining in 2005.

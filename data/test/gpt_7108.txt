El Poblenou  is an extensive neighborhood in the city of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It is located in the northeast corner of the city, bordering the neighborhoods of Gràcia, Eixample, Sarrià-Sant Gervasi and Pedralbes. It is bordered by the Avinguda Diagonal to the north, the Carrer de la Princesa to the east, the Carrer de la Universitat to the south and the Carrer de Sant Pau to the west.   The neighborhood was originally farmland that was bought by the City of Barcelona in 1875. The construction of public works in the late 19th century led to an increase in population and El Poblenou became one of Barcelona's most vibrant neighborhoods. In recent years it has undergone a process of gentrification and has become a desirable residential area for young professionals.   El Poblenou is home to a number of public institutions, including: the University of Barcelona, Iglesia de Santa Maria del Mar, Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona (MACBA), Palau de la Música Catalana, Parc del Liceu and Palau Reial de Catalunya.

In set theory, a branch of mathematics, uniformization is the process of making a set of objects (typically called elements or members of the set) appear to be the same, regardless of how they are picked or what order they are considered.  Uniformization is used in various ways in mathematics, but is most commonly used to make sets look like collections of numbers. For example, if you have a set of objects that can be arranged in any order, you can use uniformization to make them look like a collection of numbers. This is done by making sure that the numbers in the set are all the same, no matter which object they are assigned to.

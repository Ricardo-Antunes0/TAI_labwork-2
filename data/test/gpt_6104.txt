The Sámi Grand Prix has been a regular event on the rallying calendar since 1992, when it was known as the Sámi Cup. The rally was first staged as a support event to the World Rally Championship, and has since become one of the most important events on the Finnish calendar.

Block has won the event four times, while Loeb has triumphed three times.

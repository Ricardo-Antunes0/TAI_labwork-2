The Sterling Highway is a  state highway in the south-central region of the U.S. state of Alaska, leading from the Seward Highway at Tern Lake Junction,  south of Anchorage, to Homer. Route description Construction of the highway began in 1947 and was completed in 1950.  The Sterling Highway is part of Alaska Route 1. It leads mainly west from Tern Lake to Soldotna, paralleling the Kenai River, at which point it turns south to follow the eastern shore of Cook Inlet. It is the only highway in the western and central Kenai Peninsula, and most of the population of the Kenai Peninsula Borough lives near it. The highway also gives access to many extremely popular fishing and recreation areas, including the Chugach National Forest, Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, and the   Kenai, Funny, and Russian rivers. The southern end of the highway is at the tip of the Homer Spit, a landspit extending  into Kachemak Bay. A ferry terminal here connects the road to the Alaska Marine Highway.

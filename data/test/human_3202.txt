The Ekatmata Yatras were a series of pilgrimages and political strategies used to promote Hindu Polity or Hindutva. The strategy involved the mobilization of large pilgrimages (Yatras) to gather support for pro-Hindu political positions. The concept of the Ekatmata Yatra was formulated by the Vishva Hindu Parishad in the early 1980s. Description  During the 1960s, the rise of Hindu nationalism in Indian politics resulted in several Hindu-supportive political parties and organizations growing in size and influence. One of these political parties was Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), a right-wing organization which mobilized support for Hindu politicians and policies. In 1983, VHP decided to organize a widespread series of political pilgrimages across India; these Yatras were intended to galvanize public support for causes that VHP supported. In particular, the pilgrimages were organized in such a way as to be Pan-Hindu, allowing members of all castes to participate; this was in keeping with one of VHP's long-held opinions that the caste system should be suppressed. The march was also focused around that idea that, by reigniting interest in Hindu religious rights, Hindus would be less susceptible to conversion attempts by Christians and Muslims.

Gastrophryne elegans, the elegant narrow-mouthed toad, is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae found in Central America. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, intermittent freshwater marshes, plantations, rural gardens, and heavily degraded former forests. It is threatened by habitat loss. Description The elegant narrow-mouthed toad has a small triangular head and is flattened dorsoventrally. The females have a snout-to-vent length of about , while the males are slightly smaller. The colouring is somewhat variable and helps to camouflage this frog among the leaf litter. The dorsal surface has a broad, dark-brown, central stripe which widens and narrows irregularly and is delineated with a narrow, dark line. On either side is a reddish-brown area and then a dark-brown line that runs from the tip of the snout, past the eye, over the shoulder to the groin. The thighs have two dark bands and further lines occur on the lower leg which align when the animal is crouched. The ventral surface is dark brown or black, mostly obscured by indistinct whitish spots which merge. The hind feet each have a tubercle on the metatarsal and slight webbing on the fourth toe. The outer toes have flattened, spreading tips.

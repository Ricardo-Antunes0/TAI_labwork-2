Joseph Noa (21 October 1856, Nagybecskerek â€“ 17 November 1938, Szeged) was a Hungarian physician and dermatologist. He is most notable for his discovery of the cause of psoriasis, a disease that he treated with coal tar.  Noa was born in Nagybecskerek, Hungary in 1856 to a Jewish family. He studied at the University of Vienna, where he obtained his medical degree in 1880. He then worked as a doctor in Vienna and Budapest. In 1898, he moved to Szeged, where he served as the director of the Szeged Medical School and the chief physician at the Szeged General Hospital.  Noa made his major scientific discovery in 1906 when he identified coal tar as the cause of psoriasis. He treated many patients with coal tar, and soon discovered that it was effective in curing the disease. His work led to the development of psoriasis treatment methods and procedures that are still used today. Noa died in 1938 at the age of 86

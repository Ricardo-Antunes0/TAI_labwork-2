Gallium monoiodide (GaI or Ga4I4) is a low-valent gallium species that acts as a reactive intermediate for many gallium-based products. Gallium(I) halides were first crystallographically characterized by Schnöckel and coworkers and have allowed a synthetic route to many low-valent gallium species. However, chemical syntheses that employ “GaI” rather than gallium(I) halide precursors have been increasingly investigated given the ease of synthesis of this reagent. While the synthetic method of Schnöckel and coworkers to synthesize gallium(I) halides require extraordinarily high temperatures, the straightforward preparation of “GaI” at near room temperature has allowed for the exploration of new gallium-based chemistries. Synthesis  In 1990, Malcolm Green and coworkers synthesized a “GaI” species, whose method of preparation is most widely followed. They found that ultrasonication of liquid gallium metal with iodine in a toluene solvent yields a new pale green powder that they referred to as “GaI”. Although this intermediate was relatively simple to synthesize, the chemical composition of “GaI” was not determined until the early to mid 2010s.

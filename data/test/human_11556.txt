The NMBS/SNCB Type 64 was a class of  steam locomotives built as Prussian P 8s for German railways, delivered as war reparations to Belgium at the end of World War I. 168 locomotives of this type were delivered to Belgium, working mostly on light passenger trains operated by the National Railway Company of Belgium (NMBS/SNCB). The final locomotives of this type were withdrawn in 1967, marking the end of steam service in the country. Design, construction and service history As part of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany had to deliver over 2000 locomotives to Belgium as reparations. The first units arrived in Belgium in 1919, still wearing their German paint and copper plates identifying their region of use and a number. Painted verdigris for the body, black for the smoke box and the red for the chassis, wheels and decoration, these units would retain their German number identification plates until January 1925, keeping their German numbers until they were renumbered by the SNCB on October 1, 1931.

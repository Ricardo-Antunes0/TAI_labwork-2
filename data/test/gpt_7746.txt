Sidney James Weinberg (October 12, 1891 – February 5, 1951) was an American mathematician and physicist who made important contributions to the theory of quantum mechanics.  Weinberg was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Russian-Jewish parents, Morris and Florence Weinberg. After graduating from high school in 1910, he studied mathematics at Rutgers University, where he became interested in the theory of relativity. In 1916 he moved to the University of Chicago, where he worked with John von Neumann on the theory of quantum mechanics. He married Joan Steiner in 1922 and had two daughters.  Weinberg's major contributions to quantum mechanics include the development of a theory of wave–particle duality and the prediction of the existence of quanta called fermions. He also developed matrix mechanics, a mathematical framework that describes the behavior of particles in collisions. In 1948 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on quantum mechanics. Weinberg died in 1951 at the age of 60 after a long battle with cancer.

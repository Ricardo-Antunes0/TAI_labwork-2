He worked for several years as a session violinist for leading music directors Laxmikant Pyarelal, Kalyanji Anandji, Bappi Lahiri, Rajesh Roshan, Anand–Milind, Nadeem-Shravan, Jatin–Lalit and A. R. Rahman. Finally, he got a break with Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. Earlier, Darbar had played violin for Jatin–Lalit in the movie Khamoshi: The Musical. Later, his music in Bhansali's Devdas was acclaimed. He did not work with Bhansali after Devdas due to personal differences. After Devdas, Darbar did a few more movies but without much success. In 2005, he composed for seven out of 12 tracks for Subhash Ghai's Kisna: The Warrior Poet after A. R. Rahman had left the project mid-way to complete an international assignment. However, Ghai would later say, "The music [of the film] has turned out so well that you can't distinguish an Ismail song from a Rahman one".

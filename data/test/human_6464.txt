"Intuition" is a song by American singer Jewel from her fourth studio album, 0304 (2003). The song was written and produced by Jewel and Lester Mendez. It was released on April 7, 2003, as the album's lead single. Following the club success of "Serve the Ego", Jewel shifted to a more pop-oriented sound with the release of "Intuition". The song, which strays from her usual folk style with simple acoustic guitar instrumentation, starts off with a French accordion and then experiments with dance-oriented beats with subtle urban influences, using synthesizers. The song's lyrics contain a number of references to popular culture, including namechecking celebrities such as singer and actress Jennifer Lopez, model Kate Moss, actor Charlie Sheen, magazines, film culture, and commercialism. "Intuition" achieved moderate success in the United States, reaching number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. However, a number of Jewel's fans criticized her for abandoning her traditional folk style in exchange for a new pop sound. After the song was licensed to promote Schick Intuition razors, Jewel was accused of "writing a song that tells us all to resist the total marketing mentality... and then licensing that song to a consumer products company for a huge sales campaign."

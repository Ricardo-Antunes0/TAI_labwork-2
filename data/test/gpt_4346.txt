A trade study or trade-off study, also known as a comparative study, is an academic research method used to identify the comparative advantages and disadvantages of two or more options or courses of action. The study also identifies any potential tradeoffs between the advantages and disadvantages of each option.  A trade study is typically used in business, economics, engineering, and other fields to help make informed decisions about investments, contracts, or products. In many cases, a trade study can be used to help determine whether a proposed investment or course of action is worth pursuing.  The purpose of a trade study is to identify all of the possible consequences of taking one course of action over another. The goal is to identify any potential benefits and drawbacks that could occur as a result of pursuing one option over another.  One common approach to conducting a trade study is to compare two or more options side by side. This allows for a comprehensive look at all of the possible consequences associated with each option.  Another approach is to focus on specific areas where one option might be better than another. This allows for a more targeted look at the benefits and drawbacks associated with that option.  Regardless of how it is conducted, a trade study is an important tool for making informed decisions about investments, contracts, or products.

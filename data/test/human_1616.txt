Andrea Moda Formula was a Formula One team that competed during the 1992 season. Its founder was Italian shoe designer Andrea Sassetti and the name came from Andrea Moda, Sassetti's company. The team participated in nine World Championship Grands Prix, but despite officially entering two cars for several races, managed only a single race qualification. Thus statistically, and by general perception, Andrea Moda is widely considered to be one of the poorest constructor efforts to take part in a F1 Grand Prix. Origins In September 1991, Sassetti bought the Coloni F1 team after it had failed to pre-qualify a car for every single race that year. Coloni's four-year history resulted in 14 starts in 82 attempts. The team had not qualified or pre-qualified for a race since Roberto Moreno started 15th at the 1989 Portuguese Grand Prix – meaning the team had qualified for no races throughout the 1990 and 1991 seasons – while its best finish was an 8th place for Gabriele Tarquini in the 1988 Canadian Grand Prix.

Natural, Everyday Degradation is the second studio album by Remo Drive, released on May 31, 2019. Natural, Everyday Degradation sees the band take a different artistic direction, drifting away from the emo sound of Greatest Hits. This is their first studio album without drummer Sam Mathys. Background Natural, Everyday Degradation was recorded after the departure of drummer Sam Mathys in February 2018 with drum parts being recorded by Braeden Keenan & Sam Becht. When asked about the change of musical style of Natural, Everyday Degradation in an interview, Erik Paulson replied, "...as far as like, styles go, I think just our, our tastes have changed, we've grown up a little bit. And uh, not wanting to fit in quite as neatly in with, I feel like there's kind of a scene with a bunch of bands that do a similar, kind of upbeat, kind of party emo thing right now, and I think, more than anything, we just wanted to separate ourselves from what was going on, and make it clear that we're, kind of on our own path and not a part of a group, or a scene, or a clique or anything."

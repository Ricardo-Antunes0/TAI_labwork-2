The semi-contrabassoon (also called quint bassoon, semi-contra or half-contra) is a double reed woodwind instrument pitched between the bassoon and the contrabassoon.  It is pitched in either F (quint bass) or G (quart bass) a fifth or fourth, respectively, below the bassoon. These instruments were used mostly in the 18th century and are remnants of the old quart bass dulcians.  They were considered easier to make than the larger contrabassoon.  A semi-contrabassoon was shaped like an oversized bassoon, between  tall with a long descending bocal.  Little literature exists that indicate that these instruments were used, although it is possible that they may have been used to some extent in military bands.  No attempt to revive this instrument in the present day has been made.  The great organist Charles Marie Widor in his book on orchestration expected that the semi-contra would be added to the orchestra's roster.

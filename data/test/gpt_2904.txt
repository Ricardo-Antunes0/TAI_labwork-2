Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD or PIGD) is a technique used to diagnose genetic disorders in embryos before implantation into the uterus. PGD is performed by removing a single cell from an embryo before it is placed in the uterus for fertilization. The cell is then analyzed for abnormalities, and if a disorder is found, the embryo can be discarded or used in another fertility procedure.  PGD has been used in humans since the early 1990s, and has been increasingly used in recent years to prevent serious birth defects. However, PGD also has potential ethical and social implications, as some people may view it as a form of eugenics.

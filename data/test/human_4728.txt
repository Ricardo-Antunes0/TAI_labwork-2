Shakthi Vasudevan (born as Prashanth Vasudevan) is an Indian actor who has predominantly worked on Tamil-language films. The son of director P. Vasu, Shakthi began his career as a child artist in his father's films before making his comeback in the lead role in Thottal Poo Malarum (2007). He has since enjoyed limited success as an actor, notably appearing in Ninaithale Inikkum (2009) and his father's Kannada film, Shivalinga (2016). Career Shakthi first featured as a child artist in his father P. Vasu's films, portraying small roles in films including Nadigan (1990), Chinna Thambi (1991) and Senthamizh Paattu (1992). In 2007, he returned in the lead role in his father's Thottal Poo Malarum (2007); however, the film fared averagely at the box-office. In regard to his performance, Sify.com stated "the only silver lining is Sakthi who makes a decent debut" and that "he is good looking and does his role with a certain amount of confidence". His following films, the romantic comedy Mahesh Saranya Matrum Palar (2008) and the college drama Ninaithale Inikkum (2009) garnered good reviews, with the latter also performing well at the box office. For the former film, a critic from Rediff.com wrote Shakthi "looks shell-shocked a couple of times but mostly manages to deliver a creditable performance."

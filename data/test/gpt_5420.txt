The Anglo-Hellenic League was founded in the early 1880s to oppose Greek irredentism and to promote British interests in the region. The League played a major role in the formation of the modern Turkish Republic, and its members also played a significant role in the creation of the Turkish Republic's armed forces.  The League was initially an informal grouping of British, French, and Russian interests in the region. However, in 1892, it was formally established as a political alliance with the goal of opposing Greek irredentism and promoting British interests in the region.

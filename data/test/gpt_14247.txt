In mammals, ungual tufts are tufts of hair that arise from the papillary ridges on the digits of the hands and feet. They are most commonly seen on human fingers and toes, where they are used for tactile sensation. The function of ungual tufts is unknown, but they may play a role in thermoregulation or in the maintenance of grip strength.

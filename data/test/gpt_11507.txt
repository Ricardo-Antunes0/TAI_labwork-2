The Eötvös experiment was a famous physics experiment carried out in the early 20th century by the Hungarian scientist and philosopher Eugene Eötvös.  The Eötvös experiment was designed to measure the speed of light in a vacuum. The experiment used two mirrors, one in each end of a specially made transmission line. The transmission line was connected to a source of light, such as a sunbeam, and was set up so that the two mirrors were exactly opposite one another.  The experiment was designed so that the light would go from the source of light to the first mirror, and then from the first mirror to the second mirror. However, because of the nature of light, it was also possible for the light to go back down the transmission line to the source of light.  The main goal of the Eötvös experiment was to find out how long it took for the light to travel from the source of light to the second mirror.

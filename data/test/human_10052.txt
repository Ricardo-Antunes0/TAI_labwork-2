The  (;  Charters of Sobrarbe) are a mythical set of charters allegedly ennacted during the 850s in the Pyrenean valley of Sobrarbe. The charters were allegedly drafted by Christian refugees fleeing from the Muslim invasion of the Iberian peninsula, and enshrined the aragonese legal custom of placing laws before kings. Although the charters were extensively exploited in later centuries, modern scholarship regards them as a fabrication. In the 13th century, the cities and the nobility of the kingdoms of Navarre and of Aragon started using these legendary fueros as a foundation for their own legal rights and privileges. The first historical mention of the Fueros de Sobrarbe appears in this context, as part of a falsified version of the original city charter of Tudela postdated to 1117. This charter was manipulated sometime at the beginning of the reign of Theobald I of Navarre (r.1234-1253). Having inherited a distant kingdom from his maternal uncle, Theobald I agreed to have the customary laws of his newly acquired realm codified, and the citizens of Tudela presented the crown with a forged version of their own city charter that mentioned for the first time the Fueros de Sobrarbe as the foundation of their historical rights. In 1237, Theobald I agreed to confirm this manipulated charter. Thereafter, the Fueros de Sobrarbe were included in many of the city charters of Aragonese and Navarrese frontier towns, and eventually made it to both the Fueros of Navarre (1238) and the Fueros de Aragon (1283). In both of them, the Fueros are mentioned as the historical foundation of those kingdoms and their institutions.

The TVR 400/450SE was a series of open sports cars designed and built by TVR in the late eighties and early nineties. The 400SE was introduced in 1988, the 450SE a year later. The 400SE was the last of the Wedges built, with the last cars being produced in late 1991 and registered in 1992. There were also special versions built, with two Sprintex supercharged 400SX built by dealer 'Northern TVR Centre' in 1989, and three Griffith engined 430SEs were constructed in 1991. History The 400SE was largely similar to late 390SEs, but featured marginally larger displacement - 3,948 versus 3,905Â cc. The body was as for Series 2 390SEs, with the more rounded nose and a large rear underbody aerofoil. An asymmetrically vented bonnet hinted at what was underneath, and there was a large rear spoiler (smaller than the 'bathtray' style used on the SEAC, but still large). The appearance was considerably more mature than the wild SEAC, but both suffered from the large transmission tunnel which cramped the footwell and serious heatsink from the large engines. On the plus side was the "phenomenal noise" and "exhilarating acceleration".

New Play Project is a non-profit organization that creates new works of theatre for audiences in the San Francisco Bay Area. We believe that theatre can be an essential part of a community's cultural life, and we work to make this vision a reality by commissioning new plays, providing training and support to emerging artists, and creating opportunities for audiences to experience our productions.  New Play Project was founded in 2004 by artistic directors Marsha Norman and David Henry Hwang. The organization's mandate is to commission new plays for an audience in the Bay Area, providing training and support to emerging artists, and creating opportunities for audiences to experience our productions. We have produced eleven new plays since 2004, with more in the pipeline.  We are a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

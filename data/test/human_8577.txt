Poland–Venezuela relations refers to the diplomatic relations between the Republic of Poland and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. History In the 1630s, there were ideas being proposed between Duke Jacob Kettler and the King of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, John II Casimir Vasa for Polish colonization of Venezuela. Polish ships had explored settlements within the Caribbean and tried on four occasions to establish a colony on the nearby island of Tobago, however the attempt of a colony failed and all plans to establish a colony in Venezuela faltered. In 1787, Polish King Stanisław August Poniatowski hosted future Venezuelan military leader and revolutionary, Francisco de Miranda for a few days in Kaniów (in present-day Ukraine) while Miranda was traveling Europe. During the Venezuelan War of Independence, several Polish officers served and fought for Venezuelan independence against Spanish troops. One Polish officer, Izydor Borowski fought for Venezuelan independence and was promoted to general by Simón Bolívar. Soon after Venezuela obtained independence, small numbers of Poles immigrated to Venezuela, many of them scientists, clergy, architects and engineers.

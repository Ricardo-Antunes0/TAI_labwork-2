HMS Dunkirk was a 60-gun fourth-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, built at Chatham Dockyard. She served in the Seven Years' War, the American Revolutionary War and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.  The ship was captured by the French on 22 May 1794 and renamed L'Orient. She was broken up in 1806.  Dunkirk was designed by Sir Thomas Slade and launched on 21 July 1754. She was commissioned under Captain George Byng in October 1755. In early 1757 she took part in a failed expedition to retake Minorca. Dunkirk then fought at the Battle of Quiberon Bay in November 1759, where she helped repel a Franco-Spanish invasion force. Dunkirk was deployed to North America the following year, taking part in the Battle of Fort Cumberland in April 1760 and the Battle of Minorca in July of that year. In March 1762 she recaptured ÃŽle Royale from the French and participated in the Battle of Lagos Bay later that year. In February 1764 she helped capture Havana from Spain. Dunkirk then served in the Mediterranean theatre of operations during the First and Second Turkish Wars, taking part in various actions off Cyprus, Rhodes and Syria.  In October 1795 Dunkirk was one of seven ships that formed Sir John Jervis's squadron off Brest to prevent a French invasion of Great Britain.

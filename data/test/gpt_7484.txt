Academic probation in the United Kingdom is a form of sanction or disciplinary action taken against a student by their university, college or other educational institution. It is typically used for students who have failed to meet expectations in terms of their academic progress or behaviour.  Probation may be imposed for a period of time, either continuously or for a specific set period of time, and may be accompanied by conditions such as attending counselling or tutorials. The decision to impose probation is usually made after an assessment of the student's circumstances and behaviour.  There are several reasons why a student might be placed on academic probation, including poor academic performance, involving cheating or plagiarism, disobeying rules or regulations, and persistent poor behaviour. Students who are placed on probation are generally required to take additional exams or tutorials in order to improve their grades, and may also be required to attend disciplinary meetings or counselling sessions.  Academic probation has been described as a "last resort" measure, and is generally only used when other forms of punishment have failed to improve the student's academic performance. It is often seen as a more severe form of punishment than suspension, and can have a significant impact on a student's future opportunities at university.

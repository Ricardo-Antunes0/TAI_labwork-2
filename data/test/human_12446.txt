John Writhe (died 1504) was a long-serving English officer of arms. He was probably the son of William Writhe, who represented the borough of Cricklade in the Parliament of 1450â€“51, and is most remembered for being the first Garter King of Arms to preside over the College of Arms. Writhe is also notable for the contention that it was he who developed the system of heraldic cadency employed by English officers of arms to the present day. Heraldic career It has been claimed that Writhe began his career as Antelope Pursuivant or Rouge Croix Pursuivant under Henry V, but this is doubtful. By February 1474 he had been appointed Falcon Herald. On 25 January 1477 Edward IV made him Norroy King of Arms and on 6 July 1478, he was promoted to Garter Principal King of Arms. Writhe officiated at Edward's funeral in April 1483 and at Richard III coronation the following July. As Garter he also took part in the coronation of Henry VII who reappointed him on 13 February 1486 with back pay to the date of Bosworth.

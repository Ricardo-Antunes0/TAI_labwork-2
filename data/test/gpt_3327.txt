In theoretical physics, the Batalinâ€“Vilkovisky (BV) formalism is a mathematical formalism used to describe the strong coupling between subatomic particles. It was introduced by Boris Batalin and Arkadi Vilkovisky in 1984.  The BV formalism is a generalization of the quark model of hadrons, which describes the strong interaction between quarks. It is also applicable to the weak interaction and beyond. In particular, it can be used to describe the structure of hadrons and the matter fields that generating them.

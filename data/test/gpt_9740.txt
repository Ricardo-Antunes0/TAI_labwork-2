David Wolfenberger (born April 19, 1969, in San Francisco, California) is an American artist and writer. He has exhibited extensively in the United States, Europe, and Asia, and his work has been included in museum exhibitions worldwide.  Wolfenberger was born in San Francisco, California, and raised in Marin County. He earned his BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1991, and his MFA from the University of California at Berkeley in 1995.  Wolfenberger's art is composed of installations, paintings, drawings, photographs, and video works that investigate the relationship between artifice and reality, memory and history, life and death. His work often features appropriated or repurposed materials – such as vintage clothing or antique furniture – that are reconfigured to create new works of art.  Wolfenberger has exhibited his work at venues including the Museum of Modern Art in New York City; the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington D.C.; the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington D.C.; the Centre Pompidou in Paris; the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo; and the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. In 2019, his installation "The Revenant" was featured in the Venice Biennale.

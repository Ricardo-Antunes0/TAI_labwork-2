Neotonality (or Neocentricity) is an inclusive term for a range of musical styles and movements that focus on the use of minor keys or "minor tonalities". This encompasses a wide variety of styles, from early classical music to 20th century art music, as well as various types of popular music.  The term is derived from the Greek word "neo", meaning "new" or "recent", and "tonos", meaning "tone". Neotonality stresses the use of minor keys, which were not frequent in classical or earlier European music. These keys were popularized in the 18th century by Antonio Vivaldi and others, and have since been used in a wide range of music.  Neotonality has been associated with several musical movements and styles. These include Romanticism, Impressionism, Jazz, Post-Romanticism, New Age and contemporary classical music. It has also been used to describe various types of popular music, such as rock and roll, blues, soul, rhythm and blues and pop.

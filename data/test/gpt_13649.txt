The White Terror  was a period of intense violence and terror that took place in Russia in the early 1920s. The term is often used to describe the purges and executions of political opponents that took place between 1918 and 1922, during the Russian Civil War. The White Terror was also a period of social upheaval and economic instability, which contributed to the outbreak of the Russian Revolution of 1917.  The White Terror was a response to the failed October Revolution of 1917, which had been followed by a period of civil unrest and political instability. The Bolsheviks, who had led the October Revolution, were now struggling to maintain their grip on power against a coalition of conservatives and military leaders who opposed their rule. In response to this opposition, the Bolsheviks began a campaign of purges against their political opponents, which quickly turned into a bloody massacre.  The victims of the White Terror included members of the old regime, suspected counter-revolutionaries, traitors, and anyone else who was considered an enemy of the Bolsheviks. Thousands were executed without trial or mercy, and millions were imprisoned or forced into exile. The White Terror greatly contributed to the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, as it created an atmosphere of fear and paranoia among the population.

History Boisdale was the run of pioneer grazier Lachlan Macalister and was named after the village on the island of South Uist in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. In the 1840s and 1850s, Boisdale was the local headquarters of the Native Police in the Gippsland region. This force would set out from their barracks, patrol the area and conduct punitive raids on various clans of the Gunai people. Macalister's run, being the immediate area around the barracks, was one of the sites of mass aboriginal fatalities due to the Native Police.

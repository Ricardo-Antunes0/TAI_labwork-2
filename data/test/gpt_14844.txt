Annihilation is a military strategy in which an attacking force defeats its enemy by destroying all of its military forces, or by forcing the enemy to surrender. Annihilation is often used as a last resort when other strategies have failed.  The term "annihilation" was first used in classical antiquity, where it referred to the complete destruction of an enemy army. In medieval times, the term was also used to describe the complete Rout of an enemy army. The Battle of annihilation is a well-known example of this tactic.   During the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon employed the tactic of annihilation against his opponents. He famously said "An army that has been thoroughly destroyed can never be replaced." By destroying his opponents' armies, Napoleon was able to achieve rapid and decisive victories.   Today, annihilation is still used as a military strategy. It is most commonly used in situations where other strategies have failed, such as when an attacking force is outnumbered or outgunned. Annihilation can also be a last resort when other strategies have been exhausted, such as when an enemy has fortified its position and refuses to surrender.

Jabłkowski Brothers  is a Polish trading company, founded in 1863 by Michał Jabłkowski and his brother Józef. The company specialises in the production of tobacco products, including cigars and cigarettes.  The Jabłkowski Brothers emerged as one of the largest tobacco companies in Europe during the first half of the 20th century. The company's success was built on the shoulders of its founders, who were able to build a strong business foundation through hard work and innovation. The Jabłkowski Brothers became one of the leading producers of cigarettes in Europe, and its products were popular among consumers throughout the continent.  However, the company's fortunes took a downturn following World War II. The industry underwent a major transformation as cigarette consumption decreased, and the Jabłkowski Brothers were unable to keep up with the new competition. In 1984, the company was acquired by the Ruś Radomska Group, and it continued to operate as a subsidiary until it was closed down in 2002.

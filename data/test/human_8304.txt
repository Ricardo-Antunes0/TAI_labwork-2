Kavita Bala was born in Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay), India in 1971 and is a computer scientist, entrepreneur, and academic. She is Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University. After serving as department chair from 2018–2020, she was appointed Dean of the Faculty for Computing and Information Science now known as the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science. Bala’s research expertise is in computer vision and graphics. Her work was recognized in 2020 by the international Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics and Interactive Technique - ACM SIGGRAPH - for “fundamental contributions to physically-based and scalable rendering, material modeling, perception for graphics, and visual recognition.” Her early research focused on realistic, physically-based rendering and includes seminal work on scalable rendering, notably the development of Lightcuts and other approximate illumination algorithms, as well as contributions to volumetric and procedural modeling of textiles. Currently, Bala is studying recognition of materials, styles, and other object attributes in images.

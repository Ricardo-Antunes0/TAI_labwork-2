Lesya, according to the Jain theory of cosmology, is the presiding deity of the world of the living. She is also regarded as the goddess of beauty, love, and fertility.   Lesya is often depicted with a garland of flowers around her neck or holding a flower in her hand. She is also often shown seated on a throne or bed.

Rajarata [rā dja ra tə] (Meaning: King's Country) is a historical region in the eastern part of India. It is bordered by the Ganges River to the north, the Bay of Bengal to the east, and the Vindhya Range to the south. The region covers an area of 403,263 square kilometers.  Rajarata was ruled by a succession of Hindu and Muslim kings from the time of the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate in 1206 until its fall in 1526. The Mughal Empire later replaced the Delhi Sultanate as the ruling power in Rajarata. In 1772, Rajarata came under British rule after the Battle of Buxar. The region remained under British rule until 1947, when it became part of independent India.  Rajarata is now divided into six administrative divisions: West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh.

The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) is an Irish paramilitary organisation that was active during the Troubles. The UVF was formed in 1912 and is considered to have been responsible for a number of sectarian killings, including the 1972 Dublin and Monaghan bombings. In 1997, the UVF disarmed and disbanded under pressure from the Northern Ireland police.

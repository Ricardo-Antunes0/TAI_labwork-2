Margaret Melhase Fuchs (August 13, 1919August 8, 2006) was an American chemist and professor at the University of California, Berkeley. She is known for her work on the structure and reactivity of molecules.  Melhase was born in Chicago on August 13, 1919. She received her B.S. from Northwestern University in 1941 and her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1945. After postdoctoral work at the University of California, Berkeley, she became a professor at UC Berkeley in 1963.  Melhase's research focused on the structure and reactivity of molecules. She was particularly interested in the interaction between atoms and molecules, and in the process of chemical reactions. Her work helped to develop a deeper understanding of chemical bonding and how molecules interact with one another.  Melhase died on August 8, 2006, at the age of 84. She was survived by her husband, Paul Fuchs; two daughters; and four grandchildren.

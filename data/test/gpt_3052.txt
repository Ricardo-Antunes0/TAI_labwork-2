An astronomical interferometer or telescope array is a group of telescopes used to measure the positions and distances of celestial objects. The most famous astronomical interferometer is the Hubble Space Telescope.  An astronomical interferometer consists of a number of telescopes arranged so that their optical paths are periodically crossed. This allows the measurement of the time delay or aberration between the signals received from each individual telescope. The relative positions and distances of the telescopes can then be determined using trigonometry. This information can then be used to calculate the positions and distances of objects in the sky.  The first astronomical interferometer was the Hooker Telescope, which was built in 1871 by George Biddell Airy. The modern astronomical interferometer was developed in the 1960s by astronomers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The first such instrument was called SPITZER, and it was built in 1963. Since then, dozens of astronomical interferometers have been built, most of which are operated by NASA.  Astronomical interferometers have many advantages over traditional telescopes. They are much more sensitive than normal telescopes, and they can be used to make precise measurements of very small time delays or aberrations. They are also much more sensitive to faint objects than traditional telescopes are, which makes them ideal for studying distant galaxies and stars.

Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI; ) is a statutory organisation responsible for the management of inland fisheries in Ireland. Established as the Irish Inland Fisheries Board in 1951, IFI is now a multimillion-euro organisation with a staff of over 300.  The Irish inland fisheries are an important part of the country’s economy. In 2010, Ireland’s inland fishery industry generated €1.2 billion in economic activity and supported over 9,000 jobs. The sector is well organised with a strong sectoral structure, comprising around 60 companies operating in both traditional and new sectors.  The main focus of IFI’s work is on developing and maintaining sustainable fisheries resources, while ensuring that the sector is accessible to all. IFI also works to promote the importance of inland fisheries to the Irish economy and society as a whole.

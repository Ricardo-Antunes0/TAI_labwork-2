Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte (Research Reports in Nuclear Physics) are a series of scientific journals published by the German Physical Society. The series was founded in 1958 and is currently the most important forum for high-quality research publications in nuclear physics.  The aim of the Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte is to provide a forum for the publication of high-quality research findings in nuclear physics, by providing a venue for scientists from all over the world to exchange their work. Each journal contains original research papers, review articles, and short communications. The series is particularly strong in its coverage of experimental and theoretical developments in nuclear physics.

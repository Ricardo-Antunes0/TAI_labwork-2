Mindegade is a 120 meters long street in Aarhus, Denmark, situated in the historic Indre By neighborhood. Mindegade runs from north to south from Fiskergade to Dynkarken and the square Europaplads. Mindegade gradually evolved from around 1606 as the city slowly extended southwards as the harbor was expanded and the river was covered up. The name is from some time before 1796 and refers to the nearby outlet of the river; the word "minde" is an old Danish world for river mouth and "gade" means street. Mindegade is fairly narrow and is a one-way street going from north to south. *The street contains two listed buildings; Trods Katholm and Hans Broge's House. History  The city gate Mindeport was originally situated at the end of Mindegade and is first mentioned in the 1500s. Mindeport was the gate travelers coming from the south had to come through. After coming through the gate one had to move over the bridge Mindebroen to cross the Aarhus river and move on into Skolegade and the city proper. In 1690 the city gate was moved further south to Dynkarken by Ridderstræde but as the area became more heavily populated it was eventually moved to Sønder Allé. In 1857 the octroi taxes were abolished and Mindeport along with the rest of the gates in the city were torn down.

Mandoli v. Acheson, 344 U.S. 133 (1952), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the First Amendment protected the right of an individual to wear a "peace symbol" (a mandoli) on her head.  The plaintiff, Marguerite Mandoli, was arrested in Philadelphia while wearing a peace symbol on her head. The District Court held that the peace symbol was an "immoral and seditious" garment, and that it violated city ordinance ยง 9-107. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that the peace symbol was not obscene or indecent under Pennsylvania law and that the city ordinance therefore did not violate the First Amendment.  The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Third Circuit, holding that the peace symbol is an emblem of free speech and that ยง 9-107 is unconstitutional as applied to Mrs. Mandoli. The court noted that although peace symbols are associated with pacifism, they have also been used as symbols of anti-war sentiment.

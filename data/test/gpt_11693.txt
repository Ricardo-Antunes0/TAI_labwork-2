The Women's Indian Association (WIA) was founded in 1885 in Calcutta by a group of women who wanted to improve their social and economic status.   Today, the WIA has over one million members and is the largest women's organization in India. It works to improve the lives of women and girls through education, health, empowerment, and social justice. The WIA also provides support to marginalized groups, including women from marginalized communities, Dalit women, and survivors of sexual violence.

A canner participates in canning, the collection and processing of fruits and vegetables into canned food. The term canning is derived from the French word canner meaning to cook by boiling in water. The process of canning begins by selecting, washing, and trimming the produce. The produce is then packed into jars and sealed with a hot lid. Canning pressure is then applied to the jars for a specific time, which destroys any spoilage bacteria. The processed food is then stored in a cool, dark place.

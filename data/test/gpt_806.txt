In common usage, technoscience refers to the application of science and technology in the pursuit of economic or social goals. In a more narrow definition, technoscience may refer to the application of science and technology for the purpose of achieving specific technological goals.  Technoscience has come to play an important role in modern society, as it has allowed for the development of many technologies that have revolutionized our lives. It has also allowed for the development of new industries and businesses, and has opened up new possibilities for research and exploration.  The term technoscience arose out of the need to distinguish between technologies that were simply tools that could be used for any purpose, and technologies that had specific applications or effects. Technologies that were considered to be in the first category were often referred to as traditional technologies, while those in the second category were typically referred to as cutting-edge technologies. However, the boundaries between these two categories have become increasingly blurred over time, and today technoscience can be used to refer to any technology that falls within the scope of scientific inquiry.  One of the key features of technoscience is its ability to improve human life in a variety of ways. For example, technoscience has played a major role in the development of medical technology, such as MRI scanners and CT scanners. It has also allowed us to build more advanced computers and telecommunications systems, which have enabled us to conduct research and communicate more effectively.  In addition, technoscience has also played a major role in advancing our understanding

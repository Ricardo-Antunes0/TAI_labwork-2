The London Ice House was an arena in the London area that was used for ice skating, roller skating and other forms of winter sports from 1892 until its demolition in 1959. It was located in the London borough of Richmond upon Thames, just to the west of Richmond Park.  The ice house was built in 1892 by a group of local businessmen as an ice rink and sports venue. It quickly became one of the most popular places in London for ice skating and roller skating, and hosted international events such as the World Figure Skating Championships and the World Amateur Roller Skating Championships.  The rink's popularity led to its rapid expansion, and by 1909 it had a capacity for 2,500 spectators. However, its popularity also led to its rapid decline. By the 1950s it had lost its appeal to modern audiences, and was demolished in 1959 to make way for a new housing development.

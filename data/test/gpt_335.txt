Annie Stevens Perkins (, Stevens; after first marriage: Perkins) (November 3, 1884 – February 16, 1951) was an American socialist and feminist. She is best known as the co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) with Roger Baldwin.  Annie Stevens Perkins was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, the daughter of a printer and typographer, Edwin Stevens, and his wife Eliza (née Moore). Perkins's parents divorced when she was three years old and she was raised by her mother. She was educated at the Lowell High School for Girls and Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. After graduating from college in 1906, Perkins worked as a teacher in a girls' school in Lawrence, Kansas. In 1909, she married journalist and socialist William Z. Foster.  In 1915, Perkins became secretary of the Socialist Party of America's Women's Bureau and later served as its executive secretary. In this position she helped to organize women into party units and to increase party membership among women. In 1917, she helped to found the Women's Trade Union League (WTUL).   In 1919, Perkins co-founded the ACLU with Roger Baldwin. The ACLU became one of the most important American civil liberties organizations of the 20th century, working to protect freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and due process rights. Perkins also served as the organization's first president from 1919 to 1939. During her presidency, the ACLU successfully fought for such landmark civil rights cases as Brown v. Board

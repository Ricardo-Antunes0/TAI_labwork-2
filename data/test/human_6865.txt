The Jacob Hoffstetter House is a former single-family home located at 322 East Washington Street in Ann Arbor, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History Jacob Hoffstetter arrived in Ann Arbor in 1854 at the age of five with his parents, Christian and Mary Hoffstetter; one of a large number of German immigrants who arrived in the area in the 1840s and 1850s. In 1872, Jacob Hoffstetter established a saloon and grocery on Main Street. Jacob, his wife, and his family lived above the store for some time. The business proved prosperous, and in about 1887 Hoffstetter sold the business and used the proceeds to construct this house. The home was large, and the Hoffstetters took on boarders. These included the men of the University of Michigan chapter of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, who boarded with the Hoffstetters from 1888 when the chapter was founded until 1894.

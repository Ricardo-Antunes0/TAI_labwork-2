David Richard Evan Hale (born October 26, 1945) is a retired United States Army brigadier general. He was a major general when he retired, but was convicted in a court-martial of eight offenses and demoted one rank. He is the second Army general to be court-martialed since the Uniform Code of Military Justice went into effect in 1951 (after Major General Robert W. Grow in 1952) and the first Army general prosecuted after retirement. Hale graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1967 and served as a company commander in the 82nd Airborne Division in the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, he was awarded the Silver Star for picking up an enemy grenade in a foxhole and throwing it away during a firefight. In 1989, he led the 9th Infantry Regiment of the 7th Infantry Division during the United States invasion of Panama (Operation Just Cause). Later posts included Chief of Technology Management for the Office of the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, Deputy Director for Political-Military Affairs of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Deputy Commanding General for the United States Army Pacific (1994-1996), senior U.S. officer, NATO Allied Land Forces South-Eastern Europe and finally Deputy Inspector General of the Army in November 1998. His responsibilities in his last posting included investigating personal misconduct.

The star-nosed mole (Condylura cristata) is a mammal of the family Condyluridae. This species is endemic to North America and lives in underground colonies of up to thirty individuals. It is the only extant member of its genus.  The star-nosed mole is a small creature, measuring just over a foot long and weighing just over a pound. It has a pointed snout and a large number of star-shaped pores on its head and body. These are used to detect food underground, as the mole has no other senses of sight or hearing. The mole is dark brown or black, with a yellowish underside.  The star-nosed mole is an insectivorous creature, feeding on insects, worms, and other small creatures. It lives in colonies of up to thirty individuals, where each individual helps to care for the young and look after the colony's food supplies. The star-nosed mole is threatened by human activity, including development and farming.

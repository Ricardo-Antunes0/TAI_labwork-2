Gadani  is a coastal town of Hub District located in the southern part of Balochistan along the Arabian Sea, Pakistan. It is also a Union Council of Hub Tehsil and is just a 1-hour drive away from Karachi, Sindh. The population of Gadani was estimated to be around 10,000 in 2005. More than 97% of the population is Muslim with a small Hindu minority. The majority of the population speaks Balochi and there is a small Sindhi speaking minority. They belong to the Sanghur, Kurd, Sajdi, Muhammad Hasni, and Bezinjo tribes. Many prehistoric shell-midden sites were discovered along the shores of a small bay, near Gadani. They are characterized of heaps of fragments of marine and mangrove shells among which are flint and jasper tools and stone querns. The first radiocarbon dates obtained from these middens indicate they result from the activity of people who settled along the coast both during the seventh and the fifth millennium before present.

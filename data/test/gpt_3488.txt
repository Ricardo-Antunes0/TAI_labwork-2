A wood-burning stove (or wood burner or fireplace) is a type of stove used to cook food by burning wood, typically in the form of logs, chips, or pellets.  The first wood-burning stoves appeared in the Middle Ages, and were used to cook food in lodges and other remote locations where open fires were not allowed. They have since become popular in homes and commercial settings as they are efficient and economical, burning wood at a much slower rate than an open fire, and producing significantly less smoke.  Today, wood-burning stoves are available in a range of styles and sizes, from small Wallis stoves used for cooking small quantities of food, to large central heating stoves used for cooking large quantities of food. Many modern wood-burning stoves come equipped with features such as automatic start and shut-off, built-in ovens and grills, and thermostats to regulate the stove's heat.

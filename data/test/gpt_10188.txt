The 2018 Argentine monetary crisis was a financial crisis in Argentina that began in December 2017 and lasted until March 2018.   The crisis was caused by a decline in the value of the Argentine peso against the United States dollar and other foreign currencies, which made it difficult for businesses and individuals to pay their debts. As a result, many people lost their savings and were unable to make payments on loans. The government responded by raising taxes and cutting public spending, but this only made the situation worse. In March 2018, the Argentine government reached a deal with its creditors, which allowed it to restructure its debts and avoid bankruptcy.

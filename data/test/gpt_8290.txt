Eston Hemings Jefferson (May 21, 1808 â€“ February 6, 1873) was an American slave who was the half-brother of President Thomas Jefferson and the father of Eston Hemings, Jr., who was also enslaved.  Eston Hemings was born in 1808 in Charlottesville, Virginia, the son of Eston Hemings, Sr., and Betty Hemings. His father was a white slaveowner who owned six other slaves. Eston Hemings' mother was a black slave who belonged to Jefferson.  Jefferson and Hemings were not close, and Jefferson did not raise Eston Hemings as his own son. In 1831, after the death of Eston Hemings' father, Jefferson freed Eston Hemings and his remaining slaves. Eston Hemings moved to Monticello, where he lived with Jefferson until his death in 1873.  Eston Hemings had four children with two of his enslaved women: Eston Hemings Jr. (born 1820), James Madison Hemings (born circa 1825), Madison Robards Hemings (born circa 1826), and Sally Hemings (born circa 1828). All four children were enslaved by Jefferson and lived at Monticello until the end of his life.  The descendants of Eston Hemings are currently living primarily in Kentucky and Virginia.

Alta Via 1 is a 150-kilometre-long high-level public footpath which runs through the eastern Dolomites in Italy. It is also known as the Dolomite High Route 1. It passes through some of the finest scenery in the Dolomites. The path runs south from Pragser Wildsee, near Toblach, to Belluno. Prags can be accessed by bus, and Belluno has both train and bus services.  This is the classic high route in the Dolomites, and also the easiest. It gets slightly more difficult as it goes south, but the only section which might present difficulties is the descent from Schiara, and this can be bypassed. About 10â€“15 days are required to complete the full route. A typical day on the route might involve about seven hours walking, with ascents and descents of about 800 metres. It can be attempted during the period July to September, when the route should be largely free of snow. The route is signposted by dark blue triangles with an inset number one.

Singles (also written s1NgLEs) is a Greek musical term meaning "a song, piece of music, or performance by a solo performer."  The word "single" is derived from the Latin word "singulus", meaning "a single person or thing". In medieval and early modern English, the word "single" meant "unmarried", as in "a single man", and was used to describe a person or thing without a mate. This meaning has largely been superseded by the modern sense of being unmarried or alone.

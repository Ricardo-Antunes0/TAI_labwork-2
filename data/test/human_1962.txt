Willow is a ghost town in Manatee County, Florida, United States. Overview In 1923 or 1924, a mill was built at Willow by the McGowin-Foshee Lumber Company from Alabama.  The company leased 54,000 acres of land for logging.  James I. Robbins, Bruce Robbins and James A. Robbins bought it in 1926. The Robbinses also bought 40,000 acres of woodlands that ran south to where State Road 70 is today.  The area is believed to have included a sawmill, turpentine still, a planer mill, a dry kiln, Robbins family home, general store (known as the commissary), 75 to 80 worker houses with garden plots, a house of prostitution located on the Little Manatee River, Snowden's filling station, a post office constructed in 1889, a railroad depot with a water tower, and a church, school, and juke joint located in the black section of town. There was a narrow gauge railroad which had 3 engines, a service car and about 30 logging cars equipped with no brakes.  At its height, as much as 50,000 board feet a day was cut.  There were around 250 workers.  They were paid in scrips (small round tokens) that were to be spent in the commissary and were also accepted in the house of prostitution.  Willow was separated into white and black sections.  The white section was the south end and the black section was the north end.  The black children went to the school in Willow and the white children went to school north in the town of Wimauma.

The Field Elm cultivar Ulmus minor 'Viminalis' is a deciduous tree typically growing to 10–15 m tall, but occasionally reaching 20 m or more. The leaves are broadly ovate, 8–12 cm long and 5–8 cm broad, with a serrated margin. The tree is dioecious, with male and female trees producing different types of flowers. The male trees bear small, pendulous fruit 2.5–3 cm long. The species is native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, from Europe and Asia Minor eastwards to Japan and south to the Caucasus and Iran. It is also naturalized in North America, where it has become naturalized in scattered locations in Quebec, Ontario and the eastern United States.

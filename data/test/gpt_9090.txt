Torch River is a river in the United States. It is a tributary of the Klamath River and flows for about 110 miles (177 km) in the north-central part of Oregon.  The Torch River rises in the Blue Mountains of southern Oregon, near the community of Applegate. It flows generally northwest, joined by twelve minor tributaries, to enter the Klamath River about 10 miles (16 km) south of Klamath Falls. The Torch and its tributaries are popular fishing streams.  The lower stretch of the Torch is within the Frank Church–River of No Return Wilderness Area, while the upper stretch, upstream of Klamath Falls, is within the John Day–Burney National Forest.

In the 1950s, together with a variety of other aircraft designers, Fairey developed the Atalanta, a light fighter aircraft. The Atalanta was a sleek and fast design, with a top speed of over 400 km/h (250 mph). It was well armed for its time, with a 20mm cannon and six machine guns. The Atalanta saw service with several countries, including France, Italy, and Portugal. In 1969, the Atalanta was retired from service.

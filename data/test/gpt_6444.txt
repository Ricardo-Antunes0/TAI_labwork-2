Edmund Blampied (30 March 1886 – 26 August 1961) was an Australian artist who worked in a variety of media, including oil painting, watercolour, sculpture and printmaking.  Born in Melbourne, Blampied attended the National Gallery of Victoria School of Art from 1908 to 1911, and then the National Gallery of Victoria College of Art from 1911 to 1914. He then studied at the Royal Academy in London, England from 1914 to 1916. He returned to Australia in 1916 and became a founding member of the Australian Society of Painters in Watercolour in 1919.  Blampied's work is characterised by its lyrical and atmospheric qualities, and often centres on landscapes and seascapes. He exhibited regularly at the National Gallery of Victoria and the Melbourne Art Gallery between 1923 and 1953, and his work is held in many public galleries around Australia. He was awarded the Wynne Prize in 1949 and the Order of Australia Medal in 1956.

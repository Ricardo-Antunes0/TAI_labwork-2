The Eastern Slope Inn is a historic hotel at 2760 White Mountain Highway (U.S. Route 302) in North Conway, Carroll County, New Hampshire. Built in 1926, it is one of the community's most prominent examples of large-scale Colonial Revival architecture, and is historically important as a major element in the popularization of downhill skiing in the area. The inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Eastern Slope Inn stands at the northern fringe of the commercial downtown area of North Conway, on the west side of White Mountain Highway, the town's principal thoroughfare. It is a three-story wood-frame structure, with a hip roof crowned at its center by an open widow's walk. A four-column pedimented gable projects at the center of the main facade, and single-story porches extend from it to either side; that on the left has been enclosed. The interior features richly decorated public spaces.

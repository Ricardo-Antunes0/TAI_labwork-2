The Yorkeâ€“Talbot slavery opinion was a legal opinion issued by the Chief Justice of England and Wales, Edward Talbot, in 1772. It was a ruling in the case of The Royal African Company v. The Attorney General. The opinion held that slaves imported into British colonies were not property, but instead were persons who had a right to freedom. As a result, the slave trade was abolished in the British Empire in 1807.

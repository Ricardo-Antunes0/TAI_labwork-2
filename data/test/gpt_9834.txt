MPEG-4 Audio Lossless Coding, also known as MPEG-4 ALS or MPEG-4 AVC, is a lossy audio compression format developed by the MPEG committee. It is a successor to the earlier MP3 encodings, and is used in DVDs and Blu-ray discs.  MPEG-4 Audio Lossless Coding is a compression algorithm that uses low-latency coding techniques to reduce the amount of data needed to represent audio signals. This can lead to significant improvements in audio quality over other compression formats, such as MP3, while also reducing the storage requirements of audio files.  As of July 2017, MPEG-4 Audio Lossless Coding is the most popular audio codec on the web, with over 54% market share.

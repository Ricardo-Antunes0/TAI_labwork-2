In the mathematical field of differential geometry, a metric tensor is a generalization of the notion of a vector in a vector space. It is a three-dimensional vector consisting of two components: a direction and a magnitude. The direction is usually specified in terms of an angle between two coordinate axes, while the magnitude represents the magnitude of the vector's length along that given axis.  A metric tensor can be used to describe the geometry of curved surfaces, and can be used to solve problems in differential geometry. A number of fundamental theories, such as Riemannian geometry and general relativity, rely on the use of metrics.

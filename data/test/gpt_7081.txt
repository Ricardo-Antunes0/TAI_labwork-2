Castle Grande was a real estate development in Tampa, Florida, USA. The project was conceived in the early 1990s by then-developer Larry Ellison and his business partner, Ron Perelman.  Castle Grande was a large-scale residential and commercial development that was planned to be built on the site of the former Carlton Plantation in Tampa. The project was cancelled after Ellison's financial problems in 2002.   The site is now occupied by the University of South Florida's Tampa campus.

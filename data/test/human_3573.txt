"This Ain't Nothin" is a song written by Chris DuBois and Kerry Kurt Phillips, and recorded by American country music artist Craig Morgan. It was released in January 2010 as the fourth single from his album That's Why.  It is only available on later presses of the album.  The song entered the top 40 on the U.S. country charts on February 2, 2010. It is his seventeenth single release. Content When a reporter asks an old man about the tornado that has just destroyed his home, the man recounts some of the people he has lost during his life – a father, a brother, a best friend, his left hand, and, most recently, his wife of fifty years – and explains that losing a measly house “ain’t nothin’” by comparison. Unlike his deep-down emotional bruises, the rubble in which he stands “ain’t nothin’ time won’t erase” and “ain’t nothin’ money can’t replace.”

"Hope of Deliverance" is a Rock/Latin song by English singer-songwriter Paul McCartney from his ninth solo studio album, Off the Ground (1993). The song reached number 18 on the UK Singles Chart and became a top-five hit in Austria, Canada, Germany, Italy, Norway, and Switzerland. The song was recorded during sessions for "Off the Ground", which took place on 17 July 1992. The overdub session is described in detail by Italian percussionist Maurizio Ravalico in the book Paul McCartney: Recording Sessions (1969â€“2013). Critical reception Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, "The legendary artist continues to embrace warm and positive visions on this first glimpse into his upcoming "Off the Ground" collection. A soft, acoustic-anchored arrangement clips along at a breezy pace. Spanish cultural influences and handclappin' rhythms gives the track a unique and refreshing vibe that will please programmers at pop, AC, and album-rock levels. Like a visit from a dear old friend." Randy Clark from Cashbox commented that "this single is certainly not representative of the more brilliant musical work Paul has done over his 30-plus year career, although it's refreshing that he continues to enjoy the process." He added, "The intended inspiration of this track offers no solutions to "...the darkness that surrounds us", but it could be comforting for some to know Mr. Happy McMoneybags can still write a positive little pop song about anything."

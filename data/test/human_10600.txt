An only child, she was brought up on Langeland but attended high school at Svendborg on Funen where she met Gustav Schroll whom she married in 1965. Thanks to outstanding marks in her school leaving exams, she received a scholarship which enabled her to study medicine at Aarhus University, graduating in 1968.

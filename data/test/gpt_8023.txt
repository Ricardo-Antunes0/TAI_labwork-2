The Old Academy Building  is a historic former school building located at the corner of North 2nd Street and West Walnut Street in downtown Springfield, Illinois. The building was designed by architect George W. Stoughton and built in 1873. It is a three-story brick and limestone structure, with a mansard roof, impressive cast iron cornice, and a massive two-story central pediment. The building served as the principal school building for the Springfield School District from its construction until 1916, when it was replaced by a new school facility. In 1979, the Old Academy Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.  The Old Academy Building is significant for its architecture and its role in the history of Springfield education. The building is one of only two surviving examples of Stoughton's high-style architecture in Springfield, and it is one of only a few remaining buildings from the city's early period of growth. The Old Academy Building also played an important role in the city's education system for over seventy years, serving as the principal school building for the Springfield School District from its construction until 1916.

Jo Man-yeong (; 1776 — 1846) was a Korean politician and court minister of the Joseon Dynasty. He was the leader of the Pungyang Jo clan. The clan rose to prominence, pushing out the Andong Kim clan that had wielded power since the King Sunjo regime. However, with the death of Jo Man-yeong in 1846, control of the kingdom once again fell into the hands of the Andong Kim clan.

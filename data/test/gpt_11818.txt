A sylvan theater—sometimes called a greenery theater, tree theater, or botanical theater—is a type of open-air theater built in natural settings, such as woodland areas or gardens. Sylvan theaters owe their name to the forested areas from which they were often erected, as well as to the use of trees and other plants for theatrical set pieces.  The term "sylvan theater" was first used in the early 20th century to describe the then-new trend of building open-air theaters in natural settings, such as parks and gardens. This movement began in Europe, where designers such as Jens Jensen and Karl Bittermann sought to bring nature closer to the audience by using natural elements in their theaters. The first American sylvan theater was built in 1917 in Stonington, Connecticut, and since then similar theaters have been erected all over the world, most notably in England and Germany.  The popularity of sylvan theaters has led to the development of related concepts such as the "botanical stage" and the "tree stage." These theaters take advantage of the fact that audiences are more likely to be engaged by theatrical productions when they are situated within natural environments. The use of plants and trees not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of a sylvan theater but also serves as an environmental message. For example, a tree stage may represent nature's regenerative powers, while a botanical stage may explore the relationship between plants and humans.

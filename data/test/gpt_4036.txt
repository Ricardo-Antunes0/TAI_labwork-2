The Alikianos executions  was the mass execution of 116 people, most of whom were landowners and political figures, in the town of Alikianos on the island of Crete on 18 October 1922.  The event is best known for the brutal methods used by the local military commander, General Nikolaos Platon, in carrying out the executions. The victims were lined up against a wall and shot in the head or chest with pistols or rifles. Some were also mutilated post-mortem.  The executions are widely seen as a reprisal for the Cretan War of Independence, which had ended less than two months earlier.

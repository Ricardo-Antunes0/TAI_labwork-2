The Swiss locomotive class Ae 4/6 was a class of 2-6-2 steam locomotives built by SBB and CFF between 1923 and 1926.  The Ae 4/6 represented a significant advance in Swiss locomotive design, being the first Swiss locomotive class to be built with a four-cylinder engine. The class was also the first Swiss locomotive to be equipped with an automatic train stop system, and the first Swiss locomotive to be fitted with a vacuum brake.  The Ae 4/6 was withdrawn from service in the early 1960s, and all but two of the class have since been scrapped.

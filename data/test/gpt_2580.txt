Theodore Woodrow Kheel (May 9, 1914 â€“ February 25, 1997) was an American economist who made significant contributions to the theory of market structure, the organization of markets, and economic development.  Kheel was born in 1914 in Iowa City, Iowa. After completing his undergraduate studies at the University of Iowa in 1935, he received his doctorate from Harvard University in 1939. He then spent two years as a research assistant at the National Bureau of Economic Research before joining the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1941. Kheel remained at Berkeley for the rest of his career, and was named a professor emeritus in 1978.  During his long career, Kheel made numerous contributions to economic theory. His seminal work on market structure focused on the analysis of monopolistic competition and oligopoly. He also developed theories on economic development and argued that economic growth is contingent on innovation.  Kheel died in 1997 at the age of 83. He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1978.

dell'Arte Opera Ensemble is an opera company in New York City devoted to nurturing emerging singers through rehearsal and performance opportunities, coaching, seminars, and master classes. It was founded in 2000 by opera coach and conductor Christopher Fecteau with the goal of training young opera artists and presenting them in professional productions.  Through its Repertoire Development Program, the company features the work of emerging performers, designers, directors and conductors in both standard and rarely-heard masterworks.  Several New York premieres have been presented, such as Salieris' "Falstaff," Titus' "Rosina" and (in 2018) Salieri's "La Cifra."  In December 2010, the company presented the first performance in New York City of Engelbert Humperdinck's Königskinder since its premiere one hundred years earlier at the Metropolitan Opera. Participants Singers performing with dell'Arte range from those who have just finished music school to those pursuing regional careers and even covering major roles at the Metropolitan Opera. Among dell'Arte's noteworthy recent projects is a 2010 performance of Engelbert Humperdinck's little-known "other opera," Königskinder, celebrating the centennial of its premiere at the Met. Each summer, the company engages up to 60 young artists in its Repertoire Development Project, preparing them to sing debut roles in frequently performed operas. Presentations have included Die Zauberflöte, Ariadne auf Naxos, Don Giovanni, Le nozze di Figaro, Lucia di Lammermoor, Il trittico, and La bohème. Performances during the past several seasons have taken place in the East Village at Theatre 80 St. Mark's and The East 13th Street Theatre and as a Summer Share at LaMama Theatre on East 4th Street.

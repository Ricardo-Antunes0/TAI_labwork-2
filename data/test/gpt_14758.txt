In electronics, a linear regulator is a electronic component that is used to maintain a fixed voltage or current level. Linear regulators are also used in power supplies and inverters.  Linear regulators are composed of two main components, an inductor and a switch. When the power supply is first turned on, the inductor starts to generate a magnetic field. This field interacts with the switch, which is connected in series with the inductor. The switch allows electricity to flow only in one direction, which keeps the voltage at a constant level.

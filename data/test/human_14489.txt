In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257 (1948), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court involving the application of the right of due process in state court proceedings.  The Sixth Amendment in the Bill of Rights states that criminal prosecutions require the defendant  "... to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation...and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence."  In this case, a witness in a Michigan grand jury hearing was convicted and sentenced to jail without either notice or attorney assistance. Prior history On September 11, 1946 William Oliver was summoned by subpoena to a grand jury in Oakland County, Michigan.  Circuit Court Judge George B. Hartrick had been appointed as a one-man secret grand jury to investigate organized crime participation in local gambling and public corruption.  A local pinball operator, Oliver was examined under oath as a witness and was not accused of any crime or represented by an attorney.  At the conclusion of his testimony, Hartrick and two other circuit judges (who were not members of the grand jury but present as advisors) agreed that Oliver had given "false and evasive answers" to Hartrick's questions.  Without pausing the proceeding or permitting Oliver counsel, Hartrick convicted Oliver of contempt of court and sentenced him to 60 days in the county jail.

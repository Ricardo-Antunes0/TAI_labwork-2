Scientific jury selection, often abbreviated SJS, is the use of social science techniques and expertise to choose favorable juries during a criminal or civil trial. Scientific jury selection is used during the jury selection phase of the trial, during which lawyers have the opportunity to question jurors. It almost always entails an expert's assistance in the attorney's use of peremptory challenges—the right to reject a certain number of potential jurors without stating a reason—during jury selection. The practice is currently confined to the American legal system. Scientific jury selection is based on the work of Fred L. Strodtbeck, the research director on the American Juries Project headed by Harry Kalvin, Jr and Hans Zeisel.   He considered juries to be small groups and taped mock juries in Chicago and St. Louis  and actual juries in Wichita, Kansas with the permission of the attorneys and judge but not the jurors.  The study revealed that the characteristics of individual jurors influenced jury deliberations.

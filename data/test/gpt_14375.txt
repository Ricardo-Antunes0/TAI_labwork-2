ProMax is a chemical process simulator for engineering and chemistry students. It was designed to help students learn and understand chemical reaction mechanisms, equilibrium constants, and other physical-chemical properties of chemicals.  The ProMax software is based on the thermodynamic principles of the equilibrium constant and the Gibbs free energy. It can be used to study the kinetics of chemical reactions, to design process schemes, or to analyze products.

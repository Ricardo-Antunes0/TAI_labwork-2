Cape Lookout is a sharp rocky promontory along the Pacific Ocean coast of northwestern Oregon in the United States. It is located in southwestern Tillamook County, approximately  southwest of Tillamook, just south of Netarts Bay. The promontory extends  perpendicular to the coast, and is approximately  wide at its base, tapering as it extends outward from the coast. Cape Lookout State Park is located on the north side of the promontory, which is part of the Siuslaw National Forest.  Cape Lookout Road travels past the base of the cape.  Cape Lookout is a member of Tillamook's Three Capes Scenic Drive. The Cape Lookout Trail is a popular hiking trail, extending  through Sitka spruce forest to the tip of the promontory.  The cliff-top hiking trail offers views of Cape Kiwanda and Cascade Head to the south as well as Cape Meares, Three Arch Rocks, and Neahkahnie Mountain to the north.  Migrating whales can also be seen, generally from December through June, as they pass the end of the cape.

The Slovene lands or Slovenian lands (Slovene: Slovenska pokrajina, pronounced [slɔˈvɛnskaː pokrajina]) are the historical regions that constitute Slovenia. The term is also used to refer to the Slovene people and their culture.  The Slovene Lands comprise the traditional region of Styria and Carinthia in Austria, Slovenia's northernmost province of Lower Carniola and southern Styria in Austria, and the three Slovene counties in Italy: Trieste, Gorizia and Istria.

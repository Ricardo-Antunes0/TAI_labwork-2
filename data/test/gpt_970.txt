The Battle of Utica took place early in the American Revolutionary War, on July 8, 1777. The British forces, led by General John Burgoyne, were attempting to march south from New York towards Albany, while the Continental Army under General George Washington was attempting to intercept them.   The battle began with a British attack on a small American force at the Battle of Bennington. The Americans were able to hold their ground and drove the British back. However, Washington's army was dispersed and unable to mount an effective counterattack, and the British were able to continue their march south.   At Utica, Washington was able to rally his forces and launch an attack that eventually forced the British to withdraw. The victory at Utica prevented Burgoyne from reaching Albany and helped turn the tide of the war in America's favor.

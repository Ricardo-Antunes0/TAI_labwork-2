Organopalladium chemistry is a branch of organometallic chemistry that deals with the reactivity and properties of palladium and its alloys.  Organopalladium chemistry is a branch of organometallic chemistry that deals with the reactivity and properties of palladium and its alloys. Palladium is a transition metal that has several alloys that are used in industrial applications, such as catalysts, catalytic converters, and electrodes.   Organopalladium compounds are typically very reactive, which makes them useful in a variety of industrial applications. Some common types of reactions that are mediated by organopalladium compounds include the following:   1. Alkylation: The alkylation of organic molecules using organopalladium compounds results in the production of substituted products.  2. Oxidation: The oxidation of organic molecules using organopalladium compounds leads to the formation of radical species.  3. Decarboxylation: The decarboxylation of organic molecules using organopalladium compounds results in the release of carboxylic acids.

The Murray–Isham Farm, or more recently just Murray Farm, is a nineteenth century farmstead on the border of Lewis and Clark and McDowell counties, in the U.S. state of West Virginia. The farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.  The Murray–Isham Farm is located about northeast of Lewisburg in eastern McDowell County, and is bordered to the east by the North Fork South Branch Potomac River. The farmstead consists of a main block and two attached service wings, both built about 1870. The main block is a two-story frame structure, with a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The service wings are one-story frame structures with gable roofs and weatherboarding. Both wings have porches on their front elevations.

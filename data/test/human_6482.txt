It is native to North America, where it is widespread across much of Canada, the United States, and northern Mexico. It grows from British Columbia east to Manitoba, south as far as Sonora, Coahuila, Texas, and Mississippi.

It reaches one meter (40 inches) in maximum height. The roots may reach  deep in the soil. The rigid leaves are up to 30 centimeters (12 inches) long, becoming smaller farther up the stem.

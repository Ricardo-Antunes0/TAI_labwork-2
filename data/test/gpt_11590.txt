MS Prinsendam, a Holland-America Line cruise ship, was the largest and most luxurious ship ever built when she was launched in 1972. She measured 684 feet (209 meters) in length, with a beam of 92 feet (28 meters), and a draft of 31 feet (9 meters). Her gross tonnage was over 18,000, making her the largest and most expensive cruise ship in the world.  The MS Prinsendam was designed by Dutch naval architect W.J. Voogt and built at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, Germany. Her maiden voyage began on 10 October 1972, sailing from Rotterdam to New York City. She became flagship of Holland America Line in 1978 and remained so until she was retired in 2001.  MS Prinsendam was sold to a private owner in 2002 and moved to the Mediterranean Sea where she served as a luxury charter vessel. In January 2016, she was towed to Taiwan for restoration and will be used as a tourist attraction.

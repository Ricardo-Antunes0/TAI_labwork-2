Lancero (English: Lancer) is a military course and a denomination within the Colombian National Army. The course takes place at the School of Lanceros of Colombia in Tolemaida, Department of Tolima in Colombia. The Colombian Army has been in a military conflict with rebel guerrillas since the 1960s.  This has led the Colombian Government and its military forces to develop courses specifically aimed to the training of both soldiers and officers for this kind of warfare.  The term Lancero was chosen as a way to honor a specific unit of fighters (Lancers) that helped the army of Simón Bolívar in his conflict for the independence of Colombia.  This unit showed special bravery and strength during the Battle of Vargas Swamp. History of the Course The course was created as a result of the reform that took place inside the National Army of Colombia organization during the early 60s as a way to specialize and refocus the national army towards an irregular conflict with armed peasants in the mountains of Colombia. Inexperienced and with little knowledge of guerrilla warfare the Colombian Army sent its own officers to Fort Benning in Georgia, United States so they could take the Ranger Course that takes place there and as a way to apply their acquired knowledge in Colombia's specific situation.

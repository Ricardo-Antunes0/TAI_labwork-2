Broadhempston (alias Broad Hempston, anciently Great Hempston, Hempston Cauntelow) is a village, parish and former manor in Devon, situated about 4 miles north of Totnes. It is now administered by Teignbridge District Council. According to the 2001 census the parish contained 257 houses with a population of 641. Description The village contains a parish church, a primary school, two public houses (the Monk's Retreat and the Coppa Dolla) and a shop/post office. The working population mainly commutes to the neighbouring town of Torquay, and to the cities of Exeter and Plymouth. Many of the villagers are "incomers" and  now outnumber "natives". The proportion of professional and managerial grade employees resident in the parish is higher than the national average for comparable sized areas. House ownership levels, as a measure of prosperity, is also high. Until recently there were five farmhouses and yards within the village itself, but these have been converted to residential uses. A "Community Woodland Project" is in development, which has public access for pedestrians and will be used as a community educational resource.

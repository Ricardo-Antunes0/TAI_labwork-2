Clementi Secondary School  is a secondary institution in Fortress Hill, North Point, Hong Kong.  Founded by the 17th British Governor of Hong Kong and the 20th Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Cecil Clementi, the school has the longest history in using Chinese (with specialization in Classical Chinese) as the primary medium of instruction in Hong Kong. Besides the strong emphasis on classical Chinese, the school was also instructed, since its founding, to provide a well-rounded English education to its pupils due to its strong ties with the British colonial government. The British national anthem was sung and the Union Jack was displayed continuously until the handover of Hong Kong to China. Students and Alumni of the school are commonly known as "Clementians". The motto of the school is cited from the Analects of Confucius, "Letters, Ethics, Devotion of soul, and Truthfulness." (《論語．述而》:「子以四教：文、行、忠、信。」) The school is highly regarded in Hong Kong as one of the most selective and prestigious secondary institutions for its fine academic standards, especially in scientific subjects. The school has produced one Nobel Prize winner in Physics and several world-renowned scientists. It is also the alma mater for a number of notable academics, writers, police commissioners, and public administrators of Hong Kong. The school is also famous for its historical connection with the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

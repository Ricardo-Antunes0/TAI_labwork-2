Joel Kotkin (born December 28, 1952) is a fellow in urban studies at Chapman University in Orange, California. He writes about demographic, social, and economic trends in the U.S. and internationally.  He is a regular contributor to The Daily Beast and Forbes.com and is on the editorial board of the Orange County Register. Kotkin attended the University of California, Berkeley. A native of New York City, he now lives in Southern California, around Los Angeles. Books and thought Kotkin is the author of several books. The New Class Conflict was published in September 2014 by Telos Press Publishing. In this book, Kotkin assesses the changing complexities of class in the United States, which he argues can no longer be understood in terms of traditional political divisions between left and right or conservative and liberal. For Kotkin, the new class order of the twenty-first century is marked by the rise of a high-tech oligarchy, a culturally dominant academic and media (both journalism and entertainment) elite, an expansive government bureaucracy, and a declining middle class.

The Navy Grog was a popular rum-based drink in the British Navy and Royal Marines during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It was generally made with equal parts of hard and sweetened cider, and was often served cold or very cold.  The drink is said to have originated in the Royal Navy, where it was initially called "grog". It became popular among the crew of British ships during the American Revolutionary War, as a means of fighting off scurvy. The drink was also popular among sailors in other navies, and eventually became known as "navy grog" throughout the world.

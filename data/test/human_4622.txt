The eastern terminus is at PA 590 in Salem Township. The route is a two-lane undivided road running through rural and some developed areas southeast of Scranton.

From Moscow, PA 690 continues northeast to its terminus at PA 590 in Hollisterville. PA 690 was designated in 1928 between U.S. Route 611 (US 611, now PA 435) in Moscow and PA 590 in Hollisterville. The route was extended west to PA 502 in the 1930s. Route description PA 690 begins at an intersection with PA 502 in the Spring Brook hamlet section of Spring Brook Township just north of the Watres Reservoir. PA 690 heads northward from PA 502, passing some local residents and nearby Benjamin Pond before beginning to wind through the woodlands north of the hamlet. After the intersection with Thomas Road, the highway progresses eastward for a short distance, turning northeastward into a small resident segment near Maple Lake. After intersecting with Maple Lake Road, PA 690 turns eastward into the hamlet of Maple Lake. The hamlet is residential, as the road becomes the main street, intersecting with PA 307. There, PA 690 turns northward out of Maple Lake, winding into Exit 22 of I-380 (a southbound only exit). After I-380, PA 690 makes a short curve to the northeast before entering the borough of Moscow, where it gains the name of Church Street.

Kevin John Pugh (born 11 October 1960) is a retired English professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He made over 350 appearances in the Football League and Premier League, representing clubs such as Aston Villa, Liverpool, Sheffield Wednesday, Norwich City and Birmingham City.  Pugh was born in Leicester, and started his football career at local club Leicester City. He moved to Aston Villa in 1981 for a £60,000 transfer fee. He made his debut for Villa on 10 October 1981 in a 1–1 draw with Sheffield Wednesday. He went on to make over 350 appearances for the club, winning the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1987. He also won the League Championship twice and the FA Cup once. He left Villa in 1993 to join Liverpool, where he spent two seasons before joining Sheffield Wednesday in 1995. He spent five seasons with Wednesday before moving to Norwich City in 2001. He retired from football in 2003 after playing for Birmingham City.  Pugh has since been involved in coaching and management, most notably managing Conference National side Crawley Town between 2007 and 2009. In November 2009 he was appointed manager of Notts County following the sacking of Billy Mercer. However, Pugh was sacked by County just six games into the 2010–11 season after poor results resulted in them being bottom of League Two. In July 2011 he was appointed manager of Plymouth Argyle but left the club just over a year later after finishing 11th out of 12 teams in League Two.

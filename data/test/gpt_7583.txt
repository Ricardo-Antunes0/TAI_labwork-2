These novels were awarded the prestigious Gyldendal Prize in 1965.  Fongaard's later books include "Jens Bjørneboe" (Jens Bjørneboe, 1963), a novel about an illegitimate child who grows up to be a successful artist; "Randi" (Randi, 1967), about a woman who travels through time; and "Familien" (The Family, 1985), about a family whose members are gradually killed off one by one. He also wrote plays, among them "Kjæresten min" (My Girlfriend, 1961), which was awarded the Norwegian Academy Prize for Drama in 1962.

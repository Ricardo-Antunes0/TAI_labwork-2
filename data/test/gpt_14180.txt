Broadhempston (alias Broad Hempston, anciently Great Hempston, and Broad Hemston) is a village and civil parish in the North Somerset district of Somerset, England. It lies on the A361 road, about east of Yeovil, southwest of Taunton, and north of Bridgwater. The parish has a population of 1,702.  The name Broadhempston is thought to derive from 'broad hill', with the element 'hemp' meaning a type of tree. The earliest mention of the village is in the Domesday Book of 1086 where it was recorded as "Hempestune". The parish includes the hamlets of Hempsted and Easton.  The parish church, dedicated to Saint Mary, dates from the 12th century and has been designated as a Grade I listed building. The west tower dates from about 1450 and contains six bells. The porch was added in about 1610. There are also several good tombstones in the churchyard dating from the 18th century.  The manor house, now known as Broadhempston Manor, was built in the 16th century by Sir Thomas Wyatt and is now a hotel with restaurant.

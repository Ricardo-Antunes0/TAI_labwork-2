TanSat, also known as CarbonSat, is a proposed satellite constellation to be operated by Canadian company Telesat. The constellation is expected to consist of 100 satellites, each with a mass of about 1,000 kilograms (2,200 lb).  Telesat has been contracted by the Canadian government to provide the TanSat constellation. The satellites are planned to be launched using a rideshare arrangement with International Launch Services. The constellation is expected to be operational by 2020.  The main purpose of the TanSat constellation is to provide high-resolution imaging services for civilian and military applications. The satellites are also planned to be used for telecommunications and navigation services.

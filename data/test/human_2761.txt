Sapphirecut is the alias of singer Megan Taylor, born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The name was used originally for the progressive trance sound she formed with keyboardists Dave Shaffer and Jake Knights. Music career In December 2001, Taylor brought dubplates of the group's track "Free Your Mind" to the Winter Music Conference in Miami and handed them out to all of the DJs she admired. She picked up the phone months later, and it was superstar DJ Danny Tenaglia looking to license the track for his Back to Basics collection. The track was an underground dance classic being played by Tiesto, Paul Oakenfold, Ferry Corsten globally in concerts and on club floors around the world. The Free Your Mind track was signed by Rob DiStefano of Twisted Records(America) and the "Free Your Mind" single which was released in 2003 quickly climbed the dance charts where it was a top 10 dance track in Billboard magazine. Sapphirecut made the  news when Taylor contacted the popular and electronica oriented file-sharing network, Soulseek, in an effort to stop the group's music from being shared amongst users. She was concerned that the label she signed the track to would not get any revenue and was concerned for fellow artists. When Soulseek's server host Verio became aware of the situation, they dropped the network and it was unavailable for weeks. Sapphirecut's actions soon became a hot topic on forums across the Internet.

Historic Oakwood Cemetery was founded in 1869 and is the oldest continuously operated cemetery in Cincinnati. It is also one of the largest cemeteries in the city, with over 100,000 graves. The cemetery is located at the edge of the city on a large parcel of land that was once part of the estate of John D. Rockefeller.   The cemetery has a diverse history, with many famous people buried there including Eli Lilly, founder of Eli Lilly and Company, and Nicholas Longworth, Speaker of the House of Representatives from Ohio. It has also played an important role in Cincinnati's African American community, with many notable graves including those of Confederate General Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson and abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. The cemetery is open to the public daily from sunrise to sunset.

Eric Charles Lancelotte (26 February 1917 â€“ 16 September 1985) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Collingwood in the Victorian Football League (VFL).  The son of a coal miner, Lancelotte started his football career with the Werribee Imperials in the Victorian Football Association (VFA). He was recruited to Collingwood in 1937 and made his senior debut in the opening round of the 1938 VFL season. He played 18 games that season, but it was his performance in the 1939 VFL Grand Final that made him a household name. Playing as a half-back flanker, Lancelotte kicked two goals from full-back in the Grand Final victory over Melbourne.  Lancelotte played 20 games in 1940 and then missed the entire 1941 season due to World War II. He returned to Collingwood for the 1942 VFL season and played in all 22 games, including five finals. The Magpies were defeated by Melbourne in the 1943 VFL Grand Final but Lancelotte finished third in Collingwood's best and fairest award that year. He retired from football at the end of the 1944 season.  Lancelotte returned to playing football with Werribee Imperials after World War II and then retired from playing again at the end of the 1946 season. He later served as secretary and treasurer of Werribee Imperials.

Westpoint Exeter (formerly Westpoint Arena) is a 3,500 seat multi-purpose arena in West Point, New York. The arena is the home of the West Point Black Knights men's and women's basketball teams and the West Point Cadets women's ice hockey team. It also hosts concerts and other events.  Westpoint Arena is located on the grounds of United States Military Academy at West Point, just a few miles from the city of New York. The facility is owned and operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.  Originally built in 1938 as an armory for the U.S. Army, it was originally known as West Point Armory. The arena was renamed in 2000 in honor of Exeter native and retired U.S. Army General Wesley K. Clark, who served as Supreme Allied Commander in Europe during Operation Allied Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Macedonia from 1997 to 1999; he also commanded NATO's Southern Commands from 1994 to 1997.

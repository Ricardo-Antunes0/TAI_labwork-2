The Ascension of Jesus (anglicized from the Greek Ἀσκανίσειος Εἰς τὸ Θεὸν, translit. Askenisios En tō Theōn, also known as the Ascension of Our Lord, the Ascension of Christ, and the Easter Ascension) is the ascension of Jesus into heaven in the New Testament.  The New Testament accounts of the Ascension are found in the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The narrative tells of Jesus' appearance to his disciples after his resurrection and his ascension into heaven. Jesus announced that he was going to go to heaven, and then he disappeared from their sight.  The ascension is a significant event in Christian theology because it signifies Jesus' victory over death and his status as the one true God-man. Belief in the Ascension is one of the defining characteristics of Christianity.

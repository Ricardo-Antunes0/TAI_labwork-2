Nogueira Ferrão is a European (Portuguese) double-barrelled surname that derives from the combined surnames of two gentry families from northern Portugal, Nogueira and Ferrão. The literal meaning of these surnames is "Walnut Tree" (Nogueira) and "Stinger" or "Point on a Knight's Round Shield" (Ferrão). Only one family exists with this precise surname; anyone named Nogueira or Ferrão, but not both, may not be related to this family. History The surnames of Nogueira and Ferrão were united through the marriage in the cathedral city of Viseu of Dr. José António Ribeiro Nogueira (1716-1764) and Ana Joaquina Bernarda Ferrão Cardoso de Almeida (1723-1793) on February 26, 1743. Both families trace their roots to the city of Viseu, with the Nogueiras having direct lineage to João Nogueira, "o Velho" ("the Older"), who was born on or about 1600 and died on September 12, 1661, and was laid to rest in Massorim, Viseu, whilst direct lineage on the Ferrões can be traced to Maria Ferrão (1655-1710). From there the Nogueira Ferrão family continued to flourish, and research is able to demonstrate direct lineage dating back to around 1600 through to our present day.

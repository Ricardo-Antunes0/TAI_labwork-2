Maude Brockway (February 28, 1876 â€“ October 1, 1942) was an American psychologist who is considered one of the founders of personality theory. She developed the initial model of the five-factor model of personality, which is still widely used today.  Brockway was born in 1876 in Rochester, New York. She received her undergraduate degree from Smith College in 1898 and her doctorate from Harvard University in 1911. She began her career as a psychologist at Radcliffe College in 1912, and later served as the chair of the psychology department at Bryn Mawr College from 1937 to 1942.  Brockway's work focused on personality theory and the development of the five-factor model of personality. Her work is considered foundational to modern personality theory, and her model has been used to study a variety of topics, including personality traits, mental disorders, and social interaction. Brockway died in 1942 at the age of 68.

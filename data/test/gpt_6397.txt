Julius (born 26 December 1979) is a chimpanzee who, with Panbanisha and Santos, was the first chimpanzee to be successfully re-introduced into the wild in over 50 years.  Julius is the subject of a 2005 documentary film, "The Great Ape Trust". He has also appeared in a number of other documentaries and feature films.  Julius was born in 1979 at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, in Columbus, Ohio. He was one of four chimpanzees born to mother Koko.  Koko was a very intelligent chimpanzee and communicated with humans through sign language. When Julius was born, his mother began teaching him sign language. By the time he was three years old, he had learned more than 1,000 signs.  In 1981, Koko and her son were transferred to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. At the San Diego Zoo, Julius and his brother enjoyed playing with children in the park. In 1986, their father died and their mother stopped teaching them sign language.   In 1992, a group of scientists from Kyoto University traveled to San Diego to study Koko and her son. They were not allowed to interact with them directly, but they videotaped Koko teaching Julius how to make various signs.   In 1995, Koko and her son were transferred to the Kanazawa Monkey Forest in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. There, Julius met another male chimpanzee named Pongo for the first time. Pongo became Julius' best

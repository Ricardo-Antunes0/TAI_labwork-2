The Presidential Palace , also referred to as the Royal Palace, is the official residence of the President of Croatia. It is located in the city of Zagreb, on Strossmayer Square.   The palace was built between 1895 and 1897 by architect Antun Augustinčić for King Petar I of Croatia. The Neo-Renaissance palace was designed to resemble a French château and was modeled after the Palais Bourbon in Paris. The palace served as the official residence of the Croatian monarch until 1941, when it was replaced by the Ustasha regime's National Assembly Building. After World War II, the palace became the primary residence of the Croatian president.   Today, the palace is a major tourist attraction and contains a number of art galleries and museums. The Croatian Army's General Staff is also situated in the palace.

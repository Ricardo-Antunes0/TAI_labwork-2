Diodora rueppellii, common name the Rüppell's keyhole limpet, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Fissurellidae, the keyhole limpets. Description Diodora ruppellii has a shell with a whitish exterior marked with a radial pattern of dark blotches and a white interior surface marked with a faint pattern similar to the exterior. The shell is asteeply conical, elongated oval with a hole at the apex, which is roughly a third of the length of the shell from its anterior end. There are 20 to 25 radiating ribs on the exterior surface of the shell with some smaller ribs between them; the growth ridges are not as developed as the ribs and form knobs at where they intersect. The edges of the apical hole have conspicuous crenulations where they meet the ribs, the notches between the crenulations continue a short distance towards the inside of the shell. The shell can be up to 20 mm long, although 15mm is the most common length, and 10 mm high, in Red Sea specimens.

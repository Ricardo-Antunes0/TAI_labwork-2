The 2011 Bahraini uprising was a series of protests and civil unrest that took place in Bahrain between February and April 2011. The protests were initially sparked by allegations of electoral fraud during the 2010 Bahraini parliamentary election, but rapidly grew into a broader movement against the ruling Al Khalifa dynasty and its perceived authoritarianism. The uprising was put down by the Bahraini government with help from Saudi Arabian forces, with reports of widespread human rights abuses being reported.  As of early 2019, there are no known reports of ongoing unrest or violence in Bahrain.

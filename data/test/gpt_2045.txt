The Bezen Perrot (Breton; ), officially the Principality of Bezen Perrot, is a small, self-governing principality located in southwestern Brittany, France. The principality's name is derived from the Celtic word meaning "white rock".  The principality covers an area of and has a population of just over 1,800. It is one of the smallest French territories and has been a part of France only since 1919. The prince's official residence is at the Palace of Versailles.  The principality was created in 1919 as the result of an agreement between the French government and Prince Louis-Charles de La Tour d'Auvergne, who was recognized as heir to the defunct Comtat Venaissin. The principality was initially administered by the French government, but it gained full autonomy in 1951.

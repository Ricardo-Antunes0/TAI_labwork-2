Surface-water hydrology is the sub-field of hydrology that deals with the collection, treatment, and distribution of surface water. Surface-water hydrology encompasses a wide range of topics, from streamflow and rainfall measurement to flood control and water resource management.  Surface-water hydrology is fundamental to understanding the functioning of our water resources. It is responsible for the delivery of drinking water, irrigation, industrial production, and aquatic ecosystems. Surface-water hydrology also plays a critical role in environmental protection and climate change mitigation.

The not-for-profit institute aims to identify and train persons who have had to face adverse social conditions including physical disabilities, poverty, war strife . Its original official name was "International Institute for Social Entrepreneurship". However, to avoid the common notion of monetary gains with the usage of word 'entrepreneurship', the founders are renaming the project as kanthari international. The initial lower case letters used in the name are intentionally kept as a symbol of their ideology. kanthari, the word 'kanthari' (Malayalam: കാന്താരി) is the name of a pepper chilly that is indigenous to the land of Kerala state, India. Kanthari is known for its extreme hotness despite the small size. According to Sabriye, the head of the institute, the spice is very representative of the 'small' people who in fact, with the right motivation and preparation, can bring in a drastic and innovative change within the society.

Gertrude Carter, who was also known as Lady Gilbert-Carter (February 6, 1875 â€“ November 12, 1953) was an American-born artist and architect who signed her works as either Gertrude Codman Parker, Gertrude Carter, or Gertrude Codman Carter. Upon her 1903 marriage, she became a British citizen and wife of the Governor of the Bahamas. Within a year, her husband was appointed as Governor of Barbados, and she moved with him to Bridgetown. Immediately becoming involved in the local community, she designed a stamp for the 300th anniversary of the annexation of Barbados by Great Britain. Though Carter continued to produce art, she became more known for her designs of gardens and homes. Carter designed the garden at Queen's Park, as well as several other landmarks. The couple's home, Ilaro Court was designed and built upon her plans and later became the official residence of the Prime Minister of Barbados. A feminist, she established the Women's Self Help Association to assist women in earning their own income and fought for their right to vote. Traveling world-wide frequently, she maintained her home in Barbados until her death.

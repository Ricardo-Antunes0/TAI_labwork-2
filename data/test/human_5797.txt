His plays have been staged in several countries including Romania, Hungary, France, Italy, Poland, Slovenia, England, Scotland and the United States.

He is one of the co-founders and the former executive director of Koinónia Publishing. Childhood  Visky's father, Ferenc Visky, was a minister of the Hungarian Reformed Church who in 1958 was sentenced to 22 years in prison and forced labor by the Romanian Communist authorities for "the crime of organization against socialist public order."  Shortly after, his wife and their seven children were deported to the Bărăgan (see Bărăgan deportations); Visky was only two years old at the time.  In 1964, his father and other political prisoners were released during a short-lived period of relative thaw in which the regime relaxed its repressive policies.  Visky himself was released the same year along with his mother and siblings.

CD-R King (styled as cd-r king or CD-R KING) was a Filipino retail chain that sold discounted computer parts and gadgets, electronic appliances, and accessories. CD-R King's branches were often located in malls, where they competed against higher-end electronics retailers. History CD-R King was initially known for selling recordable media in bulk at a fraction of the cost in the early 2000s, later expanded their line to other products in response to changing market and technological trends over the years, even going so far as to offering goods which have little or nothing to do with optical media or information technology in general, (e.g. ornaments and other such accessories; this prompted the introduction of their branding divisions like STARK for appliances, California ECO-BIKE for electric bicycles, Mobile King for cell phones, and Kenko World for their cell phone accessories and health and beauty products). Most of CD-R King's products were sourced from original design manufacturers from China, Taiwan and other countries, and were sold under their own brand. Many CD-R King-branded products were re-branded versions of the same or similar products sold in parallel by their manufacturers.

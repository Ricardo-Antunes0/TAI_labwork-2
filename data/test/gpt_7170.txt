A horn section is a group of musicians who play instruments such as horns, trumpets, or trombones. The term can also refer to a symphony orchestra that includes a horn section.  Horn sections are common in symphony orchestras and can be found in many popular genres of music, such as jazz, blues, and rock. They are often used to add a distinctive sound to a musical ensemble, and their size and variety can vary greatly depending on the type of music. Horn sections are often led by a horn player known as the conductor, and they typically play in unison with other instruments in the section.

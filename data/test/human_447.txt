Intrexx is a cross-platform integrated development environment for the creation and operation of multilingual web-based applications, intranets, social intranets, enterprise portals and customer portals (extranets) as well as Industry 4.0 solutions as of 2018. A portal is created based on the drag and drop principle. Intrexx is a low-code development platform. Most applications can be created via drag & drop but manual coding can be added where necessary. History  The first version of the software was released by the German software vendor, United Planet, under the name "Intrazone" in 1999. In 2000, the software was renamed to "Intrexx Xtreme". With the release of Intrexx 5.0 in March 2010, the product line was divided into two editions: Intrexx Professional and Intrexx Compact. Intrexx Professional were the continuation of the Xtreme series and were still intended for SMEs and public administrations. Intrexx Compact contained a complete company portal with more than 50 ready-made web-applications and templates and is tailor-made for smaller companies with up to 10 PC workstations. United Planet stopped dividing the product line into two editions with the release of Intrexx 8.0. From this point on, it was simply called Intrexx. According to the manufacturer, there have been implemented more than 5,000 Intrexx portals to date (cited date: 2019). Between 2012 and 2014, the US IT research and advisory company Gartner Inc. placed United Planet with Intrexx in its market overview "Magic Quadrant for Horizontal Portals".

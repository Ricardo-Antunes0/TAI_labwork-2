The Transcendental Model 1-G was an experimental quantum computer designed and built by David Deutsch and John Preskill at the University of California, Santa Barbara in the early 1980s.  The Transcendental Model 1-G was an experimental quantum computer designed and built by David Deutsch and John Preskill at the University of California, Santa Barbara in the early 1980s. The machine was based on a two-level system of qubits, with each qubit representing a unit of information. The Transcendental Model 1-G was able to solve certain problems much faster than any other quantum computer then in existence, but it also had a number of limitations, including its inability to factor large integers.

In abstract algebra, a branch of mathematics, the Archimedean group is a discrete group of order 64.  The Archimedean group is named after the Greek mathematician Archimedes, who studied it in detail. It is a symmetric group that is also a semigroup and a monoid. The Archimedean group plays an important role in abstract algebra, particularly in the theory of groups of automorphism groups and certain related topics.

Meteor Crater, or  Barringer Crater, is a lunar impact crater that is located in the northern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. The crater was named after American astronomer Edward C. Barringer, who discovered it on November 24, 1898.  The rim of Meteor Crater is well preserved with a diameter of about . The interior floor is considerably less well-preserved and has been eroded by subsequent impacts. The crater has a rugged appearance, with a central peak and several smaller rises.  Meteor Crater lies near the northeast rim of a large impact basin that was once occupied by an older, larger crater, now lost to erosion. The basin is about long and wide.  By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Barringer Crater.

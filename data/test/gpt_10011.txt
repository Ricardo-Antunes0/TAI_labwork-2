Ant√≥nio Bento Bembe is the Secretary-General of the Union of African National Congress (UANC), a Pan-African political party. He was elected to the post in April 2009, succeeding Ahmadu Bello.  Bembe was born in Angola, and moved to Senegal in the early 1970s. He became active in the anti-colonial movement in the early 1980s, and later joined the Socialist National Party of Senegal (PPS), serving as its general secretary from 1987 to 1997. He also served as a member of the Senegalese Senate from 1999 to 2009.  Bembe became involved with the UANC in 2003, and was elected its secretary-general later that year. He has played a leading role in the party's efforts to rebuild after its defeat in the 2006 elections, and has been described as "one of the architects" of the UANC's recent resurgence.

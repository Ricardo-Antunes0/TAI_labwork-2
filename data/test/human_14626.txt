Elizabeth "Libby" Beaman (1844-1934), also known by her maiden name Elizabeth Gertrude DuBois, was the first non-Aleut woman to go to the Pribilof Islands off the coast of Alaska. She was a naturalist, artist, mapmaker, and writer. Her year spent in Alaska produced a diary in which she wrote about her experiences during seal season. Not much is known of Beaman's later life, but her contributions to documenting her time in Alaska has established her as a woman who overcame societal norms and expectations. Early life  Born Elizabeth Gertrude DuBois in Great Bend, Pennsylvania in 1844, she was the eldest child of Nicholas and Louise DuBois. Her father was a civil engineer by training but a government official by career. For two years, Libby and her family lived at Mount Vernon while her father oversaw the restoration of George Washington's home. Her father worked under presidents James K. Polk, Zachary Taylor, and was well acquainted with Abraham Lincoln. She had a passion for art and attended the Corcoran School of Art. Beaman was given the opportunity to work for her father as a mapmaker, at a time when the United States' borders were expanding. Unbeknownst to Beaman, she would work on details of a map of the Alaska Purchase in which she would draw Saint Paul Island (Alaska) and St. George Island (Alaska), her future home for a year. As part of her introduction in her diary, Beaman described herself as a tall, slim woman with an eighteen inch waist, with pale skin, long dark hair, and blue-gray eyes.

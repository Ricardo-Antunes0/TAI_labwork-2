Richard Eugene Hoagland (born 1950, Fort Wayne, Indiana) is a career ambassador in the United States Department of State. He was Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in State's Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, 2013-2015.  In the summer of 2016, based at the U.S. Embassy in Amman, Jordan, he was the senior U.S. liaison to the Russian Reconciliation Center at the Russian military base in Latakia, Syria.  In 2017 he  served as interim U.S. co-chair of the OSCE Minsk Group, the group appointed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to coordinate international peacemaking efforts on the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. From January 2011 to October 2013, he was the United States Deputy Ambassador to Pakistan, a title rarely used by State, but which has been used in other countries where the U.S. has a difficult diplomatic mission (notably in Embassy of the United States, Kabul as currently structured  and in the structure of the U.S. mission to South Vietnam in the 1960s). The title Deputy Ambassador carries more political responsibility and weight than the more common title of Deputy Chief of Mission.

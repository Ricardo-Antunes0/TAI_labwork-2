The Lost Trillion Case, also known as the Missing Trillion Case,  was an embezzlement scandal in Turkey involving the use of forged documents by the Welfare Party (, RP) executives to prevent the return of Treasury grants in amount of around one trillion lira, i.e. one million  in today's currency following the ban of the party in 1998. Party leader and former prime minister Necmettin Erbakan as well as 68 party officials received prison sentences after a court trial, although the former's was commuted to house arrest. Background The Welfare Party, an Islamist political party in Turkey founded and led by Necmettin Erbakan (1926â€“2011), had received grants from the Treasury in accordance with the applicable laws. In June 1998, the coalition cabinet of Erbakan was forced to resign following the submission of a memorandum by the military on February 28, 1998. The same year, the Constitutional Court banned the Welfare Party on the grounds that it tried to overthrow Turkey's secular system and to promote Islamic fundamentalism. Erbakan was suspended from active politics for a term of five years. The bans were upheld by the European Court of Human Rights as well.

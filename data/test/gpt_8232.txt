The world's natural resources are finite, so it is important to use them wisely. Natural capital can be used to produce goods and services for people, animals, plants, and the environment. It can also be used to protect people and ecosystems from damage or destruction.  There are many ways to measure the value of natural capital.

Another way is to measure how much natural resources are being used now and how much they could be used if they were managed more wisely.  Natural capital has many

Thurman Lee Thomas (born May 16, 1966) is a former American football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for thirteen seasons, primarily with the Buffalo Bills. He was selected by the Bills in the second round of the 1988 NFL Draft, where he spent all but one season of his professional career. Thomas spent his final NFL year as a member of the Miami Dolphins in 2000. During his twelve seasons with the Bills, Thomas established himself as a central contributor of the Bills "K-Gun" offense that utilized no-huddle shotgun formations. He qualified for the Pro Bowl five times, twice received first-team All-Pro honors, and was NFL MVP in 1991. Thomas' efforts helped his team make a record four consecutive Super Bowl appearances from 1991 to 1994; while the Bills did not prevail in any of the games, they were the first (and so far only) team to have reached the Super Bowl in four consecutive seasons. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2007 and into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2008.

Characterization, when used in materials science, refers to the process of determining the physical and chemical properties of materials. In order to characterize a material, scientists must first identify the material's constituent elements and then determine the physical and chemical properties of each element.  One of the most important aspects of characterization is determining the material's properties at different temperatures. Properties such as density, melting point, boiling point, and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) can vary significantly depending on the temperature. Additionally, characterizing materials can help scientists develop new materials or improve existing ones.  Characterization is a complex process, and scientists must use a variety of techniques to achieve accurate results. Some common methods include X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Characterization is an important part of materials science, and scientists continue to develop new methods to more accurately characterize materials.

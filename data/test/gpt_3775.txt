Skinny Living are a three piece English punk rock band from London. Formed in early 2009, the band consists of vocalist and guitarist Jack Steadman, bassist and backing vocalist Dan Coombs, and drummer Jonathan Steadman.   Skinny Living released their debut EP "Misery" in early 2010 and followed up with their full-length album "If It Ain't Broke" in late 2010. The album was well received by critics and the band toured extensively throughout 2011 supporting acts like The Get Up Kids, The Used, The Black Keys, and Jimmy Eat World. In 2012, the band announced they were splitting up after touring in support of their second album.   In 2013, Steadman formed a new trio with former members of The Maccabees, bassist Rob Healy and drummer Georgie Bampton, who released an EP called "Beacon" later that year.

Prosopagnosia (from Greek prósōpon, meaning "face", andagnós, meaning "knowing") is an impairment in the ability to recognize faces. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including damage to the brain or face-processing areas of the cortex, genetics, and neurology.  People with prosopagnosia may be able to identify familiar faces, but have difficulty recognizing unfamiliar faces or faces from other cultures. They may also have difficulty recognizing emotions in faces or recalling specific facial features. Prosopagnosia can be a symptom of a number of other conditions, including autism spectrum disorder, Huntington's disease, and dementia.

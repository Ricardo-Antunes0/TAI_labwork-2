CSS Webb, a 655-ton side-wheel steam ram, was the first steam-powered vessel to cross the Atlantic Ocean.  CSS Webb was built in 1849 in the United States by the Webb Shipbuilding Company in Chester, Pennsylvania. The ship was designed by John Ericsson and built in a record time of six months. CSS Webb was launched on May 12, 1849, and made the voyage from New York to Liverpool in just ninety-eight days, an impressive time for the era.  CSS Webb was used primarily for freight transport, but it also served as a lifesaving ship during the California Gold Rush. After its voyage across the Atlantic, CSS Webb was sold to the Chilean government and used for coastal transport in Chile and Peru. The ship was eventually sold to a French firm and used as a cargo ship in Africa. CSS Webb was retired from service in 1914 and is now preserved at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park.

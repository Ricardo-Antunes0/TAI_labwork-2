The A4260 is a road that leads from the A422 Henneff Way, Banbury to Frieze Way near Oxford.  It is single carriageway for a majority of the route, except for a section near Steeple Aston for  and on Frieze Way where the A4260 meets the A34 at Peartree Interchange, Oxford, where it becomes a dual carriageway. The road passes through Bodicote, Adderbury, Deddington and Kidlington, Oxfordshire. The road terminates at the A44 road roundabout at Frieze Way which is just north of Oxford. The route followed by the road is that of a prehistoric ridgeway between the valleys of the rivers Cherwell and Evenlode. The Romans adopted the route and paved it from north of Oxford as far as Akeman Street at Sturdy's Castle. The route remained in use through the medieval period, being described by John Ogilby in 1675 as the primary way between Oxford and Banbury. In the 18th century the route was turnpiked.

Swing Mob (sometimes known as Da Bassment) was a popular dance music nightclub in London, England which operated from 1978 to 1984.  The nightclub was located in the basement of the former Da Vinci's nightclub in Wardour Street, London. Swing Mob became well known for its late-night swing dancing and its resident DJs, including Larry Levan, Kenny Dope, and Tony Humphries.  The club was raided by the Metropolitan Police on three occasions in 1984 for drugs offences; on each occasion the club was let off with a warning. The final raid took place on 7 May 1984 and resulted in fourteen arrests. The nightclub closed shortly afterwards.

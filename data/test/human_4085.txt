Sonaram Chutia (also known as Vaishnav Pandit) was a Vaishnav scholar, freedom fighter and educationist from Assam, India. Born in Bamkukurachowa village in the Jorhat district of Assam during the British Raj, Chutia was educated in Jorhat and completed his B.Sc from Cotton College. Throughout his education, Chutia witnessed insulting comments from upper-caste boys and instances of disrespectful mistreatment from religious establishments towards certain communities.  It is said that these experiences prompted Chutia to take up his cause against casteism and racism. Sutiya began his career as a science teacher at the Sivasagar Government Higher Secondary School in 1939 but left his job and joined the Jatiya Mahasabha. He was jailed during the Quit India Movement, and he met Pitambar Deva Goswami, Satradhikar of the Garmurh Satra, in prison in 1943. In 1946, Sutiya joined the Srimanta Sankaradeva Sangha, devoting himself to working for the organisation for the rest of his life.

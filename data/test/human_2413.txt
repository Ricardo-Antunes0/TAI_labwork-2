The IML Walking Association, until 2006 the International Marching League (IML), is a non-profit organization which promotes recreational walking in the form of international non-competitive multi-day walking events ("marches") in its member countries. The motto of the organization is Nos iungat ambulare ("May walking bring us together"). History  IML has its origins in the annual International Four Days Marches Nijmegen, Netherlands, organized by the Dutch KNBLO (now the KWBN). The success of this event and the increasing number of foreign walkers led, from the late 1960s, to the KNBLO helping to set up similar annual events in other countries. These include HÃ¦rvejsmarchen in Viborg, Denmark; Marche international de Diekirch in Diekirch, Luxembourg; the International Four Days Walks in Castlebar, Ireland; and the Two Days March of Bern, Switzerland. In 1977 the Japan Walking Association established the Japan Three Day March, the first annual non-competitive walking event outside Europe. In 1986 the multi-day walking event organizations of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland agreed to form the International Marching League, which was officially founded in 1987. Since then, membership has steadily increased, with the United Kingdom represented by the International Waendel Walk in Wellingborough since 1990, and new events organised in the Far East, Australia and New Zealand.

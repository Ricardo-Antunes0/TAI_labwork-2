Marygate is a street in York, England, which runs from the junction of Bootham and Micklegate Streets in the north to the junction of Fossgate and Shipton Street in the south.  The street was historically known as Micklegate Gate after the Micklegate Bar which was located on its western side. The name Marygate is thought to derive from a nunnery called Mary House, which stood on the site of what is now the York Minster.

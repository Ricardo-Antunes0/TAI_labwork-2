Geb was the Egyptian god of the earth and  a mythological member of the Ennead of Heliopolis. He could also be  considered a father of snakes. It was believed in ancient Egypt that Geb's laughter created earthquakes and that he allowed crops to grow. Name The name was pronounced as such from the Greek period onward and was originally wrongly read as Seb. The usual Egyptian name was "Geb", perhaps 'The lame one'. It was usually spelled with either initial -g- (all periods), or sometimes with -k-point (gj). The latter initial root consonant occurs once in the Middle Kingdom Coffin Texts, more often in 21st Dynasty mythological papyri as well as in a text from the Ptolemaic tomb of Petosiris at Tuna El-Gebel or the name was written with initial hard -k-, as e.g. in a 30th Dynasty papyrus text in the Brooklyn Museum dealing with descriptions of and remedies against snakes.

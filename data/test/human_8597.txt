Richard Clement (10 June 1832 â€“ 29 October 1873) was an English first-class cricketer and civil servant. The son of Hampden Clement - an English sugar plantation owner in Barbados - and Philippa Cobham Alleyne, he was born in June 1832 at Snarestone, Leicestershire. His paternal grandfather was Richard Clement, a Dutch owner of Barbadian sugar plantations. He was the nephew of Martha Clement, the wife of the plantation owner Colonel Thomas Moody, who named a son, Hampden Clement Blamire Moody, after his father, and through whom he was related to Major-General Richard Clement Moody, the founder of British Columbia. Clement was educated at Rugby School, before going up to University College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, Clement made two appearances in first-class cricket for Oxford University, appearing against the Marylebone Cricket Club and Cambridge University in 1853. After graduating from Oxford, Clement was employed as a clerk at the Treasury. He died accidentally while on a hunt on 29 October 1873 near Bicester. His younger brother, Reynold, also played first-class cricket.

An expansion tube is a type of impulse facility that is conceptually similar to a shock tube with a secondary diaphragm, an expansion section, a test section, and a dump tank where the endwall would be located in a shock tube.   It is typically used to produce high enthalpy flows for high speed aerodynamic flow and aerodynamic heating and atmospheric reentry testing. It is used to engender short-duration, high-velocity gas flows. The device is composed commonly of three sections of tubing aligned in tandem. Thin plastic or metal diaphragms are used for separating from the sections from each other. As in an ordinary shock tube, the driver section is originally filled to high pressure with a light gas. The driven section is filled to a lower pressure with the test gas of interest. The third section of tubing, named the expansion section, includes a light gas at very low pressure.

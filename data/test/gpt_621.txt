Tesco has expanded its operations from the UK to over 150 countries around the world. The company operates in four business segments: groceries, general merchandise, banking and financial services, and property. Tesco International's core markets are Europe, Asia Pacific, North America, Latin America and the Middle East.  Tesco's growth has been helped by its aggressive expansion into new markets and its focus on offering customers lower prices than its competitors. The company has also made a number of strategic acquisitions, including the US supermarket chain Safeway in 2004 and the Dutch food group Jumbo in 2007. In February 2014, Tesco announced that it would sell its British grocery business to Asda for £3 billion.  In November 2018, Tesco announced it would sell its Brazilian grocery business to Pão de Açúcar for £2.9 billion.

A juridical person is a non-human legal entity that is not a single natural person but an organization recognized by law as a legal person such as a corporation, government agency, or NGO. Also known as artificial person, juridical entity, juridic person, juristic person, or legal person, a juridical person maintains certain duties and rights as enumerated under relevant laws. The rights and responsibilities of a juridical person are distinct from those of the natural persons constituting it. Since ancient times, associations have been known as the original form of the juridical person. This is documented for the 1st century A.D. for Jewish trading companies. In Roman law, too, the institution already had significance, although it was not called as such. Conceptually, it included institutions such as the state, communities, corporations (universitates) and their associations of persons and assets, as well as associations. At least three persons were required in Rome to found an association.

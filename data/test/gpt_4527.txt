In solid mechanics, shearing forces are unaligned forces that act on a solid object along the direction of the shear planes. Shear forces are produced when one object slides or is pushed over another object, and can be categorized according to the direction of the shear planes: normal shear, transverse shear, and shear along the long axis.  Shearing forces are important in many applications, such as in engineering materials and manufacturing. They can be used to deform a material, for example by splitting it into two pieces. They can also be used to break down objects, for example by cleaving a piece of wood.

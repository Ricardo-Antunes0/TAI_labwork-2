The Prinz-Albrecht-Palais was a Rococo city palace in Berlin, Germany. It was built between 1734 and 1740 for Prince-Elector Frederick William I of Prussia, on the site of the destroyed Frauenkirche. The palace was named after its first owner, Prince-Elector Albrecht von Prussia.   The palace served as the principal residence of the Electors of Prussia and later the Kings of Prussia. It became the official residence of the German President in 1958. The palace has been used for a number of other purposes, including housing the Berlin State Opera, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Bundesbank.   The palace was extensively damaged by Allied bombing during World War II and was eventually demolished in 1961 to make way for a new federal government building.

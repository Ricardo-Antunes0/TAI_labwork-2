Lottie Dolls are a series of dolls manufactured by the American company Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores, Inc. from 1973 to 1984. The dolls were designed by artist and illustrator Lindy Heintz, who is most famous for her creation of the character Poppin' Fresh.  Lottie Dolls are characterized by their large eyes, porcelain skin, and long black hair. They are often dressed in colorful clothing and accessorized with accessories such as purses and shoes. Heintz intended Lottie Dolls to be role models for young girls, and the dolls have been described as "the first feminist toy".  Lottie Dolls were a popular toy in the 1970s and 1980s. They were frequently found in toy aisles at department stores and were also sold through mail-order catalogs. In 1984, Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores, Inc. ceased production of Lottie Dolls.

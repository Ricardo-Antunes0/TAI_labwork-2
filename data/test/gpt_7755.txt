In machining, boring is the process of reducing the size of a hole or other feature in a piece of metal or other material by drilling it out. A boring tool is used to create the hole, and the material around the hole is cut away by the boring tool's cutting edge. The size and shape of the hole is controlled by the angle of the boring tool and the speed at which the tool moves.

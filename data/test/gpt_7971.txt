Woof! or Woof! Percussion Ensemble were an avant-garde English rock band, active between 1976 and 1981.  Woof! were formed in 1976 in London by vocalist/guitarist Peter Barge, drummer Richard Chadwick, and bassist Phil Cummings. The group's name was derived from the sound of their primitive instruments, which they called "woofers." Woof! released their debut album, "Woof!", in 1978.  The band's second album, "And Away We Go", was released in 1979 and featured experimental sound effects and unusual instrumentation such as a sitar and a tam-tam. The album was not well-received by the public, but it has since been hailed as one of the earliest examples of electronic music.  Their third album, "Woof!", was released in 1980 and featured more conventional rock instrumentation. It was more successful than the previous two albums and spawned the hit single "Where Did Our Love Go?" However, the group disbanded in 1981 shortly after recording their fourth album, "Woof! Again".  Woof! reunited for a one-off performance at London's Finsbury Park Park in 1994. They have not performed publicly since then.

The British Handball Association is the governing body of Team Handball in Britain. It has been a member of the International Handball Federation (IHF) since 1970 and of the European Handball Federation (EHF) (for IHF matters). It has 864.683 members as of 2014. Other representation at European level is under different national associations: the England Handball Association and the Scottish Handball Association. This dual structure, which is shared by several others sports, reflects the conflict between the desire of the home nations to organise the sport separately, and the need to have an overall body for international purposes, such as the Olympics. History The British Handball Association was founded in Liverpool in 1967 by four Liverpool teachers Phil Holden, Chris Powell, Jeff Rowland and Andy Smith. In 1968 the Association was accepted as a member of the International Handball Federation. Prior to this the IHF had recognised the Hull Handball League which existed between 1958 and 1962

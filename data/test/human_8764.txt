Edmund Goodwyn, M.D. (1756–1829) was an English physician whose  medical school graduation thesis contains several important contributions, including the discovery of the diving reflex. He advanced early important arguments in favor of artificial ventilation for the treatment of asphyxia over alternative resuscitation measures of the time, like heat and exsanguination. In addition, Goodwyn was the first to refute claims that pulmonary circulation stopped during exhalation. Life Edmund Goodwyn belonged to a yeoman family that settled in Framlingham, United Kingdom, at the beginning of the seventeenth century. He was baptized there on 2 December 1756, only a few months before the death of his young father. He began his medical career by completing a six year apprenticeship with John Page (1730–1794), a surgeon from the neighboring town of Woodbridge. As a medical student at the University of Edinburgh between 1779 and 1786, Goodwyn was influenced by medical luminaries like William Cullen (1710–1790), Joseph Black (1728–1799), and Alexander Monro Secundus (1733–1817).  He befriended Thomas Beddoes (1760–1808), a fellow medical student who dedicated his book of John Mayow’s (1640–1679) work on air and respiration to Goodwyn. Goodwyn dedicated his own work on the physiological aspects of drowning to his medical school friend Johannes Theodorus Van der Kemp (1747–1811) who ironically would later watch his wife and daughter drown as his boat capsized during a thunderstorm.  Goodwyn also dedicated the English translation of his thesis to John Page.

Wimborne was a railway station in Wimborne Minster in the county of Dorset in England. Open from 1 June 1847 to 2 May 1977, it was sited just north of the River Stour in what is still Station Road. Built for the Southampton and Dorchester Railway, the station was operated from the start by the London and South Western Railway, which took over ownership in 1848. It was then operated by the Southern Railway (1923â€“47) and from 1948 by the Southern Region of British Railways which traded as British Rail from 1965. Heyday From the early-1860s until the mid-1880s, the station was a significant station in its own right on the Southampton and Dorchester Railway and the point of interchange for other lines. The Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway ran from Wimborne Junction, just south of the station on the other side of river, initially to Blandford (1860) and then Burnham in Somerset (1863) and finally Bath (1874); Wimborne was the point of reversal for trains to and from Poole. The second route was the Salisbury and Dorset Junction Railway (1866), a minor line which branched off at West Moors; the station there was not opened until 1867, and goods traffic largely continued to be worked through to Wimborne and later beyond. The final new railway, branching off the original main line at New Poole Junction, was to Poole (1872) and onwards to Bournemouth (1874).

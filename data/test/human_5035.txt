Rick Emerson (born March 7, 1973), formerly known as Rick Taylor, is a radio personality most known for The Rick Emerson Show, which was broadcast from Portland, Oregon, in one form or another, from 1997 to 2012.  Emerson also co-hosted Drive-By Radio as "Rick Taylor" in Salt Lake City. He hosted the public affairs television show Outlook Portland. And he co-authored the book Zombie Economics. On January 2, 2012, Emerson announced his retirement from the broadcasting industry. Early life  Rick Emerson was born March 7, 1973, in Kennewick, Washington. He was interested in radio from a very young age. He used a RadioShack tape recorder to interview his friends. "I was like a Larry King in short pants." At age 14 he began volunteering at a local radio station. After graduating fourth-to-last in his high school class, he moved to Spokane, Washington, where he landed his first radio talk show. He broadcast weeknights from midnight to 2 a.m from a bomb shelter in the basement of the station's building. "It was just hours of me talking to NO ONE," he said. "The only calls I got were wrong numbers." During this time, he managed to earn a small but loyal following. Listeners knew him by the stage name "Rick Taylor", the last name that he picked out of a phone-book. During this time, Emerson was arrested when pulled over for a broken tail-light; a bench warrant had been issued after he forgot to pay the last $10 on a traffic ticket.

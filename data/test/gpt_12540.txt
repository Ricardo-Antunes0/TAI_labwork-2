The term H-1B-dependent employer is used by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to describe an entity that depends on H-1B visas to bring in foreign workers. This term is used to differentiate between an employer that relies primarily on H-1B visas to meet its staffing needs and an employer that uses H-1B visas as a tool to fill specific shortages in the U.S. workforce.   The H-1B visa is a nonimmigrant visa that allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in occupations that are not in the national interest. The visa is limited to employment in specialty occupations, such as scientists, engineers, and computer professionals. The visa is issued for a period of three years and can be extended an additional three years.   There is an annual cap of 85,000 H-1B visas available per year, with the majority of these visas going to aliens working in specialty occupations. In fiscal year 2017, the USCIS approved 85,000 H-1B petitions and denied 18,000 petitions.   The use of H-1B visas has come under scrutiny in recent years due to allegations of exploitation by some employers. These employers allegedly use the visa program to replace American workers with lower cost foreign workers. The use of H-1B visas has also been criticized for causing wage stagnation for American workers who are unable to obtain these visas.

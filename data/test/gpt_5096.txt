Jean-Louis Lévesque,  (April 13, 1911 – October 3, 1984) was a Canadian politician who served as the fourth Prime Minister of Canada from 1976 to 1979. He was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada.  Lévesque was born in Quebec City, Quebec, the son of Louise and Louis Lévesque. After attending high school at Collège Stanislas and then studying law at the Université Laval, he worked as a lawyer before entering politics.  Lévesque first won election to the House of Commons of Canada in the riding of Jonquière in the 1957 federal election. He was re-elected in 1962 and 1968, serving as Minister of Justice in Lester B. Pearson's Liberal government from 1963 to 1967.  In 1970, he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance in Pierre Trudeau's first federal cabinet. In 1972, Trudeau appointed Lévesque President of the Liberal Party, a position he held until 1976 when he was elected Prime Minister on a platform of "real change". His government introduced public pension plans for Canadians, national health care insurance, and mandatory bilingualism in schools.  Lévesque's minority government was defeated by Joe Clark's Conservatives in the 1979 election. He retired from politics later that year. Lévesque died on October 3, 1984 at the age of 75 after a long battle with cancer.

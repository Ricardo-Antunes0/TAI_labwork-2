M-23 activities  In the early part of 2013, Bisimwa condemned the United Nation's decision to deploy a special attack force after M23 briefly captured the city of Goma. In November 2013, the armed group was defeated by the Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC) backed by the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade (FIB). The government forces captured the remaining M23 strongholds. The group declared a ceasefire after a 20-month uprising and Bisimwa announced troop disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration according to terms that he said would be agreed with the government of Congo. He would later claim that his group came under fire after the ceasefire declaration. He also accused the Congolese military of killing suspected M23 members from May 2012 to August 2013. Bisimwa fled to Uganda through the Bunagana border crossing.

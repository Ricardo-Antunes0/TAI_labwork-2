The Piedmont Mountains are a series of outlying mountain ranges, sometimes called “low mountains”, in the Eastern United States, mostly in the western Piedmont near the Blue Ridge Mountains. The Piedmont is part of the greater Appalachian Mountain Range and is also referred to as the Appalachian Plateau. The French definition of piedmont is "foothill"; however, a Piedmont Mountain is often of greater significance or prominent elevation. Most of the features within the Piedmont physiographic province of North America lie either on the eastern border where the plateau plunges onto the Atlantic Coastal Plain at the Fall Line, in the broad valleys of the river systems, or on the western border where Piedmont Mountains occur. Occasionally, due to diverse rock formations, folds, and outcroppings, these mountains can rise at various locations across the Piedmont like the Uwharrie Mountains in North Carolina or the Pine Mountain Range in Georgia. Most of these mountains or hills are the eroded remnants of ancient mountain ranges. Some, like Stone Mountain in Georgia, are solitary rock domes called monadnocks which become further exposed with erosion.

Fort Popham is a Civil War-era coastal artillery fort constructed in 1861, south of the town of Popham, Maine. The fort is now managed by the National Park Service as a part of Fort Popham State Historic Site.  The fort is located on a high bluff overlooking the Kennebec River, and was intended to protect the vital port of Bath from Confederate attack. Construction began in early 1861, but was delayed by the outbreak of the Civil War. The fort was armed with two 24-pounder cannons and four 12-pounder howitzers, and was garrisoned by a company of U.S. soldiers.  The fort played a minor role in the Civil War, and was abandoned after the war ended. It was later used as a training ground for military officers, and was eventually abandoned in the 1920s. The fort was restored and opened to the public in 1976.

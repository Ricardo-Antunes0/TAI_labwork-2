Dmitry Sharifyanovich Karimov (born October 23, 1978) is a Russian rapist and serial killer, who raped 10 women from 2005 to 2006, killing 7 of them. He operated in the city of Yekaterinburg, in the area of the ferro-concrete products factory, for which he received the nickname The Concrete Products Maniac. Biography  Karimov worked as a bricklayer in Yekaterinburg when he committed his first offense in 2004. He attacked his girlfriend, punching her several times, then raped and strangled her with a rope. When she lost consciousness, Karimov, thinking he had killed her, took her cell phone and threw the body under a heater. The girl appealed to the police after she woke up, but did not report the rape and attempted murder, explaining that "she just got a job, and did not need any problems with the police". Karimov was convicted of robbery and infliction of bodily injuries, and was sentenced to two years imprisonment.

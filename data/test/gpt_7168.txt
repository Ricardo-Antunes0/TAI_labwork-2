Tree-adjoining grammar (TAG) is a grammar formalism that has been used to explore questions about the relationship between syntactic categories and semantic categories. TAG was proposed by Paul Kay in 1986.  TAG has been used to explore questions about the relationship between syntactic categories and semantic categories, such as whether a sentence is a conjunction or an embedded clause. TAG also allows for the examination of how different syntactic structures interact with one another.

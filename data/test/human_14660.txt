Betamethasone dipropionate is a glucocorticoid steroid with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive abilities. It is applied as a topical cream, ointment, lotion or gel (Diprolene) to treat itching and other minor skin conditions such as eczema. Minor side effects include dry skin and mild, temporary stinging when applied. Betamethasone dipropionate is a "super high potency" corticosteroid used to treat inflammatory skin conditions such as dermatitis, eczema and psoriasis. It is a synthetic analog of the adrenal corticosteroids. Although its exact mechanism of action is not known, it is effective when applied topically to cortico-responsive inflammatory dermatoses. It is available as a generic medication. Adverse effects Although the absorption of betamethasone dipropionate is small, when used for prolonged periods of time (periods exceeding two weeks), or across a large surface area (total use greater than 50 grams per week), it can have adverse effects. One such effect is the ability of the corticosteroid to suppress the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. This can lead to a depression in the release of adrenal hormones such as cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone, or ACTH. Symptoms of HPA axis suppression are often subtle and variable, but can often be detected using simple blood or urine tests such at ACTH stimulation test or urinary free cortisol. Those at increased risk for HPA axis suppression are those who are more likely to absorb more of the steroid through the skin. These groups include:  Those who have used topical corticosteroids over a prolonged period of time Those who have used corticosteroids to cover a large surface area Those with broken skin barrier or extensive abrasions  Those who have recently undergone stress (such as illness, trauma, surgery) Children under the age of 12

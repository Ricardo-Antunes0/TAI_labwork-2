James "Jimmy" Hogan (16 October 1882 – 30 January 1974) was an English football player and coach of Irish descent. He enjoyed some success as a footballer, reaching an FA Cup semi-final with Fulham in 1907–08, but his primary legacy is as a pioneer of the game and as an innovative coach across multiple European club and national sides. He is generally regarded as the architect of Total Football. Early life James Hogan was born in 1882 into an Irish Catholic family in Nelson, Lancashire, the son of James Hogan. He grew up in nearby Burnley and received his early education at St Mary Magdalene Roman Catholic School. His father hoped he would enter the priesthood and sent him to study as a boarder at the Salford Diocesan Junior Seminary St Bede's College, Manchester in September 1896. Hogan graduated at midsummer 1900 after deciding not to pursue his vocation any further, although he was College Head Boy in the 1899–1900 Academic Year.

Earle E. Williams (1898â€“1983) was a California-born anthropologist who was a pioneer in the study of shamanism. He is considered to be the founder of ethnobotany, and is known for his work on the use of psychoactive plants by Native Americans.  Earle Williams was born in 1898 in Los Angeles, California. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1922, and his graduate degree from Harvard University in 1926. Williams began his career as an anthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley, where he worked from 1927 to 1931. He then served as a faculty member at the University of Chicago until 1940, when he moved to Yale University. At Yale, Williams served as the chair of the Department of Anthropology from 1941 to 1946.  Williams died in 1983. His works include The Shaman: A Study of Indian Magic (1951), which is considered to be the foundation work on shamanism; and The Use of Psychoactive Plants by American Indians (1955), which is considered to be one of the earliest studies of ethnobotany.

"On Eagle's Wings" is a devotional Hymn composed by Michael Joncas. Its words are based on Psalm 91, Book of Exodus 19, and Gospel of Matthew 13. Joncas wrote the piece in either 1976 or 1979, after he and his friend, Douglas Hall, returned from a meal to learn that Hall's father had died of a heart attack. It was recorded in 1979, with Douglas Hall as producer, published by North American Liturgy Resources and later purchased by New Dawn Music, a subsidiary of Oregon Catholic Press. It has become popular as a contemplative hymn at Catholic masses as well as at Protestant services of worship. It is now sung during services of many Christian denominations, including Pentecostal churches, and was performed at many of the funerals of victims of September 11, 2001 attacks. It is often performed either at the beginning or the ending of a Roman Catholic funeral Mass.  It has been performed at many internationally broadcast papal Masses, was selected as part of the 2007 funeral Mass for Luciano Pavarotti in Modena, Italy, also broadcast internationally.

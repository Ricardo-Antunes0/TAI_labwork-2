Soil  chemistry is the study of the chemical characteristics of soil.  Soil chemistry is affected by mineral composition, organic matter and environmental factors. Back in the early 1850s a consulting chemist to the Royal Agricultural Society in England, named J. Thomas Way, performed many experiments on how soils exchange ions. As a result of his diligent and strenuous work, he is considered the father of soil chemistry. But after him, many other big-name scientists also contributed to this branch of ecology including Edmund Ruffin, Linus Pauling, and many others. History  Until the late 1960s, soil chemistry focused primarily on chemical reactions in the soil that contribute to  pedogenesis or that affect plant growth. Since then, concerns have grown about environmental pollution, organic and inorganic soil contamination and potential ecological health and environmental health risks. Consequently, the emphasis in soil chemistry has shifted from pedology and agricultural soil science to an emphasis on environmental soil science.

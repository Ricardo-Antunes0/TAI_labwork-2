Louis-Adélard Senécal (July 10, 1829 – October 11, 1887) was a Quebec businessman and political figure. He was a Conservative member in the 1st Canadian Parliament representing Drummond—Arthabaska, represented Yamaska in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1867 to 1871 and was a member of the Senate of Canada for Mille Isles division in 1887. He was born Louis-Adélard Sénécal in Varennes, Lower Canada in 1829 and then moved to Verchères with his family while still very young. In 1850, he set up a general store there with a partner. The following year, he entered the business of selling grain with his father. He declared bankruptcy the following year due to debts incurred earlier; his father and wife helped him settle these debts. In 1853, in partnership with his father and others, he became the owner and captain of a steamship travelling between Verchères and Montreal. The company acquired additional vessels and Senécal formed partnerships with a number of other shipping companies transporting goods in the region. He also speculated in land and was involved in the operation of sawmills and flour mills. In 1867, he was forced to declare personal bankruptcy. This did not affect the Pierreville Steam Mills Company, of which he was a part owner. However, he was forced to sell his share in the company after a series of fires left him short of liquid assets.

College Possible (formerly "Admission Possible") is a nonprofit organization that creates opportunities for low-income students to attend college. College Possible provides students with access to affordable, high-quality college preparatory programs, and provides support services to help them succeed in college.  College Possible was founded in 2002 by a group of parents and educators who recognized the need for more access to affordable, high-quality college preparatory programs for low-income students. Since its inception, College Possible has worked to increase access to quality college prep programs for all students in the United States.  College Possible operates two programs: College Possible Scholarships and College Possible Access. College Possible Scholarships provide low-income students with access to high-quality college preparatory programs. College Possible Access provides low-income students with access to free or low-cost college preparatory services.  College Possible is headquartered in New York City and has offices in Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, and Atlanta.

New Christian  was a socio-religious designation used by Restoration Movement Protestants in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It initially referred to Protestant Christians who had abandoned traditional Christian beliefs and practices in favor of a more "evangelical" or "fundamentalist" approach.  The New Christian movement emerged in the late 19th century as a reaction against what its adherents saw as rampant liberalism and secularism among Protestant Christians. The movement was characterized by its rejection of theism, belief in the divinity of Jesus, and reliance on Scripture alone for religious instruction. New Christians instead placed their faith in Jesus Christ as their personal savior, and sought to follow his example of righteousness, love, and mercy.  The New Christian movement peaked in popularity during the 1910s and 1920s, but ultimately failed to attract a significant following outside of conservative Protestant circles. By the early 21st century, the term had largely fallen out of use within American evangelicalism.

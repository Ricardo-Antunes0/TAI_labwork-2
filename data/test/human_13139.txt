The suiriri flycatcher (Suiriri suiriri) is a species of bird in the family Tyrannidae found in semi-open habitats in South America. It was formerly split into two species; the Chaco suiriri (S. suiriri) and the Campo suiriri (S. affinis). Suiriri originates from Guaran√≠, where it is a generic name used for several medium-sized tyrant flycatchers. Taxonomy The suiriri flycatcher was described by the French ornithologist Louis Vieillot in 1818 under the binomial name Muscicapa suiriri. The type locality is Puerto Pinasco in Paraguay. It has traditionally been split into two species, the southern Chaco suiriri (S. suiriri) with a white belly and the northern Campo suiriri (S. affinis) with a yellow belly and a contrastingly pale rump, but they interbreed widely where they come into contact, and consequently most authorities now consider them to be part of a single species. It has been suggested that the taxon bahiae from north-eastern Brazil, which is considered a subspecies of S. affinis when that species is split from S. suiriri, actually is the result of hybridization between suiriri and affinis. For the most part it resembles the latter, but it lacks a contrastingly pale rump as the former.

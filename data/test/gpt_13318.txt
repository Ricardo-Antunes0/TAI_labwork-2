Cape Lookout is a sharp rocky promontory that projects into the Pacific Ocean on the Oregon coast. The cape is located approximately halfway between Florence and Astoria, Oregon. The cape is a popular tourist destination for those seeking beautiful views and a quiet respite from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.  Cape Lookout was originally part of the land grant given to Joseph L. Meek in 1851 by the United States Government. Meek had come to Oregon from Kentucky in 1843 and, after working as a farmer and miller, had amassed a considerable amount of property. In 1851, he sold part of his land holdings to the federal government to establish the Cape Lookout Military Reservation. The reservation was used as a training ground for Union soldiers during the American Civil War.  In 1871, the federal government sold the remainder of Meek's land holdings to Samuel W. Hill. Hill developed the cape into a tourist attraction, erecting several buildings including a hotel, restaurant, and bathhouse. The bathhouse is still in operation and is one of the oldest operating hotels in Oregon.  The popularity of Cape Lookout led to its designation as a National Historic Landmark in 1960. Today, visitors can enjoy scenic views, take walks along the coast, or visit the visitor center for exhibits on the history of Cape Lookout and Oregon Coast tourism.

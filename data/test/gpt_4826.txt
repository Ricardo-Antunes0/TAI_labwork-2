Bertel Geismar Haarder (born 7 September 1944) is a Dutch painter, sculptor and installation artist. He has been described as one of the most important Dutch painters of the late 20th century.  Haarder was born in The Hague, Netherlands, on September 7, 1944. He studied at the Academy of Art in The Hague from 1964 to 1968, where he was taught by Jef van den Eynde and Piet Mondrian. In 1968 he moved to Paris, where he continued his studies at the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts. In 1972 he returned to The Hague and was appointed professor at the Academy of Art from 1978 to 1984. He has been a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts since 1984.  Haarder's work is characterised by its incorporation of found objects, often discarded or secondhand materials, into his paintings and sculptures. He often makes use of layers of paint, plaster, and other materials to create complex surfaces that are often partially or completely obscured by debris or dust. Haarder's work has been exhibited in museums around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York City (1984), the Tate Modern in London (1985), and the Centre Pompidou in Paris (2002).

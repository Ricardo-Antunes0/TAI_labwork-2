Delilah Blue is the second full-length studio album from pianist/singer-songwriter Joshua Kadison.  Released in November 1, 1995, it featured a change of tack.  Whereas the previous album had featured shorter songs, this disc presents a jazzier version of Kadison's music, with much longer tracks (with the title track clocking in at almost ten minutes).  He again wrote all the songs himself (with the exception of the first track, which is public domain), but this time featured in the production credits as well.  The single "Take it on Faith" did not perform very well, and EMI, which owned his contract with Capitol, voided his contract shortly thereafter.

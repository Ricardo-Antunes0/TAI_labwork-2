The Ganden Sumtsenling Monastery, also known as Ganden Sumtsenling Gompa, is a Buddhist monastery in eastern Tibet. Situated on a high mountain pass, the monastery is known for its commanding views of the surrounding valleys.  The monastery was founded in 1416 by the Fifth Dalai Lama, who chose the site because it was accessible only by a narrow and steep pathway. The original temple was destroyed in a fire in 1707, but was rebuilt under the supervision of the Eighth Dalai Lama. The present temple was built in 1694 by the Tenth Dalai Lama. The monastery served as the base of operations for the Tibetan government during the 1959 Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule.  The Ganden Sumtsenling Monastery is famous for its extensive library, which contains more than 10,000 volumes of scriptures and religious texts. The library is open to visitors daily from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm.

Sir Charles Scott Sherrington  (27 November 1894 â€“ 19 September 1973) was an English neuroscientist who made significant contributions to the understanding of the nervous system.  Sherrington was born in Bakewell, Derbyshire, England on 27 November 1894. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became a member of the Cambridge Apostles. After graduating from Cambridge in 1916, Sherrington served in the British Army during World War I. He returned to Cambridge to study medicine, and in 1922 became a Fellow of Trinity College.  In 1928, Sherrington joined the staff of the University of Oxford as a Lecturer in Physiology. He rose through the ranks at Oxford, becoming Professor of Physiology in 1946 and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine in 1949. In 1954, he moved to the University of Manchester as Head of the Department of Neurosurgery and Neurology. He remained at Manchester until his retirement in 1963.  Sherrington is best known for his work on the physiology of the nervous system. His early work focused on understanding how nerve cells communicate with each other, and his later work focused on how nerve cells generate electrical signals. His work helped to develop the field of neurobiology, and he is also credited with helping to establish the principles of neural Plasticity and Neuroplasticity.  Sherrington died on 19 September 1973 at the age of 79.

David Louis Newman (born March 11, 1954) is an American composer and pianist. He has written over 500 compositions, many of which are solo piano works, including the Grammy Award-winning song "Newman's Own Theme" from the motion picture Ghost. Newman has also composed or co-composed music for films, television, and theater.  David Louis Newman was born in Buffalo, New York, to Louis and Agnes (n√©e Kupferberg) Newman, who were both music teachers. His father was of Polish Jewish descent and his mother was of German Jewish descent. Newman began piano lessons at age four with his mother and later studied composition with Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Philip Glass at the Juilliard School in New York City. He also attended the University at Buffalo for a year before transferring to the Manhattan School of Music, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1975.  Newman's early compositions were generally tonal and influenced by minimalist composers such as John Cage and Morton Feldman. However, he soon began to experiment with more dissonant harmonic structures and rhythmic elements, which would become one of his main musical signatures. In 1977, he won First Prize in the Composers Competition sponsored by the Buffalo Philharmonic Society. That same year he premiered his first major work, the orchestral piece "And Then There Were None".  In the 1980s, Newman began to write film scores for such films as The Last Temptation of Christ, Terms of Endear

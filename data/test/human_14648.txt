The 421-a tax exemption is a property tax exemption in the U.S. state of New York that is given to real-estate developers for building new multi-family residential housing buildings in New York City. As currently written, the program also focuses on promoting affordable housing in the most densely populated areas of New York City. The exemption is granted for any buildings that add multiple new residential units, and typically lasts for 15 to 25 years after the building is completed. Longer exemption periods apply in less densely populated areas of the outer boroughs and upper Manhattan. The original program gets its name from section 421-a in the New York Real Property Tax Law. The 421-a program began in 1971, and the state government later added provisions to mandate the creation of affordable housing units in order for developers to qualify for the program. Under the original program, areas in which developers qualified for the tax break included all of Manhattan and portions of the rest of New York City.

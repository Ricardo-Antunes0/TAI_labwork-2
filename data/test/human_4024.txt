Jesse Labelle is a Country singer-songwriter. In June 2008, Labelle signed to Wax Records and began working on his debut album, Perfect Accident, which would be released April 27, 2010. His second album, Two, was released August 7, 2013. He is best known for his singles "Easier", "Heartbreak Coverup", and "One Last Night". In 2013, citing creative differences between himself and the record label, Jesse was released from his recording contract with Wax Records and relocated to Nashville, Tennessee where he teamed up with Public Artz Artist Development (Tim Hicks, Three Days Grace). In the summer of 2014 Jesse was chosen at open for Keith Urban on the "Raise 'Em Up Tour", notably at the Calgary Stampede. Audiences have embraced Jesse and his unique brand of Country music. An EP is scheduled for release in 2015. It was recorded in Nashville at Blackbird Studios and produced by David Huff and Lindsay Rimes Early life Born February 12, 1982 in Toronto Canada, Labelle first learned the guitar in his pre-teens, and played in a number of rock bands throughout high school. After graduation, Labelle discovered he had a knack for "picking apart songs" and began pursuing a career as a songwriter. Through the next couple of years, he wrote for local bands in Toronto, New York City, and Nashville as well as penning material for himself. A performance on Citytv's Speaker's Corner programme caught the attention of up-and-coming singer Fefe Dobson, who invited Labelle to write with her and perform in her band. None of these collaborations made it onto any of Dobson's studio albums, however this experience did bring Labelle into contact with songwriter/producer Jay Levine and ultimately led to a development deal with Arista Records. Sometime in the mid-2000s, talent scouts for Wax Records attended a showcase of Labelle's at a Toronto caf√©, resulting in Labelle signing with the label in 2009.

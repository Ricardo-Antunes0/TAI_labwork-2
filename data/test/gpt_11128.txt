Anarchestra is a collection of approximately 200 pieces of classical music written by Georges Bizet between 1875 and 1876. It was first performed at the Paris Opéra on 10 January 1877.  The work is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, timpani, bass drum, cymbals, and strings.  The pieces were written during Bizet's period of great creative productivity and are often considered to be among his finest achievements. They are stylistically diverse, covering a range from the romantic ballad "L'Arlésienne" to the spirited march "Carmen".

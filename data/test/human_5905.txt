The WWE 24/7 Championship is a professional wrestling championship created and promoted by the American promotion WWE. It is a tertiary championship open to anyone—regardless of gender or WWE employment status—and carries the special rule that it can be defended "24/7", as in any time, anywhere, as long as a WWE referee is present. Because of this rule, the championship is available to all of WWE's brand divisions—Raw, SmackDown, 205 Live, NXT, and NXT UK—with title changes also occurring outside of regular shows, often with videos posted on the promotion's website and social media accounts. The current champion is Dana Brooke, who is in her second reign. The title was unveiled by Mick Foley on the May 20, 2019, episode of Monday Night Raw, where Titus O'Neil from Raw became the inaugural champion. It is similar to the previous WWE Hardcore Championship, which also had a 24/7 rule. This rule can be temporarily suspended by an authority figure, usually done during a scheduled title defense or non-title matches that involve the champion.

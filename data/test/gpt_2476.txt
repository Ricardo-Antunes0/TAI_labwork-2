Kitekite Falls (also called Kitakita Falls) is a waterfall located in the Kitekite Valley in the northern part of the Waianae Range on the island of Kaua'i, Hawaii. It is a short walk from the end of Waianae Valley Road.  The falls are named for the kite kites (or "kitakites") that occasionally fall from the sky into the pools below. The falls are fed by a tributary of the Waianae River and can be reached by following a narrow path down through a rainforest. The view from the falls is spectacular, with water cascading down into several pools below. A small overlook provides a perfect spot to take photos or enjoy a refreshing drink.

One Way Down is a post-hardcore rock band that formed in late 1996 under the name decepticans. Chris Ekstedt started the band to have a resource to let out some nervous energy. The name "decepticans" was taken from a French slang for liars. "We changed the name because so many people wanted to not spell it correctly and I was tired of being related to the fucking TV cartoon, also the old name was when we were kids. One Way Down's more mature and I don't feel like an idiot with the name" - said Chris Ekstedt. They have shared the stage with bands such as L.A. Guns, Gilby Clarke, Taken, Snapcase, Stretch Armstrong and Social Distortion. Most recently they completed their first European tour with Wanker Records (the German Record Label) and Al Cheapo (punk band from Germany) Between 1998 and 2002 and under the guise of Decepticans, there was a drop off in activity from the band. Not a lot of interest lead to many changes in the band.

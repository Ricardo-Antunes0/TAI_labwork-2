The Three Robbers (Die drei RÃ¤uber) is a full-length 2007 animated film adaption of the 1961 children's book by Tomi Ungerer, which was previously adapted as a 6-minute animated adaptation released in 1972 by Gene Deitch. The film was released in America under the title of the Trick or Treaters, with the original material shortened and reworked into a Halloween story. Plot Three brothers are very successful in their exploits as highwayman robbers: Dominik using his blunderbuss to intimidate coachmen and passengers, Felix using his pepper-blower to disorientate and blind the horses, while the eldest brother Maximus vandalizes the carriage wheels with his red battle axe. But, one day the robbers intercept a carriage, only to find a lonely girl named Tiffany, whose parents died and is being sent to live with a wicked aunt who runs an orphanage. Not wanting to go to the orphanage, Tiffany tricks the robbers into believing she was the daughter of a maharaja, and is carried off to their hideout. While Tiffany makes the robbers question what they intend to do with their amassed wealth, she helps them learn to read and write when they want to send a ransom letter. The robbers eventually learn Tiffany lied to them when they found her missing child poster. Tiffany is remorseful and leaves in shame to head to the orphanage.

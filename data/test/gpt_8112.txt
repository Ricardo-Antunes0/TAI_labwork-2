Oil shale reserves refers to oil shale resources that are estimated to contain enough oil to meet the world's current oil demand for at least 100 years. The resource is located in tight, deep rock formations and is relatively easy to extract due to its low viscosity. The reserves have yet to be fully explored and could hold many more barrels of oil than currently known.

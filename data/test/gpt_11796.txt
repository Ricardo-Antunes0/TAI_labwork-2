Eucalyptus rhomboidea, commonly known as the diamond gum, is a tree native to southern Australia. The tree typically grows to a height of 30 metres and has rough bark. The leaves are arranged alternately, simple ovate to lance shaped, and up to 40 cm long. The flowers are white, with petals up to 12 cm in length and a blue eye. The fruit is a capsule 10-12 cm long and 5-6 cm wide.   The diamond gum is an important timber tree in the Australian bush. The wood is hard, strong, and very resistant to decay. It is also used for building materials and for producing oil from the resin found in the tree's trunk and branches.

The Iron Age is the final epoch of the three-age system of classical antiquity. It is the period in which the use of iron implements became widespread and strong. It began with the development of smelting techniques for producing iron from ore in the late 4th century BC and continued until the beginning of the 1st century AD.  The Iron Age was followed by the Bronze Age, during which copper and bronze became increasingly common.

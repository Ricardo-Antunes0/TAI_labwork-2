Transwave is a French Goa trance act composed of Christof Drouillet (known as Absolum) and Frédéric Holyszewski (known as Deedrah). Christof was raised in a classical musician family, though he never had training in music or electronic. First, he got involved in various new wave bands where he was the singer and the programmer. One day, he discovered the Techno music sound, and that changed his musical orientation.  Also raised in a family of musicians, Frederic Holyszewski began his musical studies at the age of five, learning Transverse flute and piano. During his teenage years, he found inspiration in the electronic music of the day, including Jean Michel Jarre, Depeche Mode, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Simple Minds. He bought his first synthesizer funded by working at night in bars as a pianist. After the split of his first rock band Vision Quest, in 1990, he started to work on his own with the help of computers.

HAT-P-32b is a planet orbiting the G-type star HD 163296, located about 25 light years from Earth. It was discovered in 2012 by a team of astronomers using the radial-velocity method.  The planet, which has a mass about 5 times that of Earth, is the first to be discovered in the HD 163296 system. It is also the first planet known to orbit a G-type star. The discovery was made using the HARPS spectrograph on the 3.6-meter ESO telescope at La Silla.

Cajon Pass (; Spanish: Puerto del Cajón) is a mountain pass in the U.S. state of California. It is located in San Bernardino County, and is traversed by Interstate 10 and California State Route 18. The pass crosses San Bernardino Mountain, at an elevation of 5,912 feet (1,783 m).  The Cajon Pass has been used by Native Americans for centuries. A trail from the San Bernardino Valley led to the Cajon Pass and thence over the mountains to the Inland Empire. The first Europeans to see the Cajon Pass were Spanish missionaries in 1776, who named it "Puerto del Cajón" because of the many cajons (holes) in the mountain range.  The first recorded use of the Cajon Pass by a white person was in 1851, when a group of Mormons led by James W. Marshall drove a wagon through it on their way from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles. The route was later improved and used by stagecoaches, wagons, and cars until the early 1960s, when I-10 was built through it.

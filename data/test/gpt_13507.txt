Sarah A. Scott   is an American archaeologist who specializes in the analysis of prehistoric ceramics.  Scott was born in 1965 in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. She received her B.A. from Brown University in 1987 and her M.A. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1990. She completed her doctorate at the University of California, Berkeley in 1998, with a dissertation on the ceramic analysis of southern Appalachian projectile points.  Scott has been a faculty member at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill since 1990, where she is currently a professor of anthropology and archaeology. She has also been a visiting professor at the University of Cape Town, South Africa; the University of Copenhagen, Denmark; and Yale University, United States. Scott is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Scott's research focuses on prehistoric ceramics from across the southeastern United States, with an emphasis on the analysis of projectile points and other artifacts from archaeological sites. Her work has helped to illuminate aspects of southeastern prehistory that have remained largely undisclosed until recently, including the origins and development of Mississippian culture and society, as well as aspects of prehistoric trade and interaction between eastern and western North America.  Scott has published extensively on her research findings, both academic papers and journal articles. She has also made contributions to television documentaries on archaeological subjects, most notably the 2000 documentary feature film Prehistoric America: The Discovery Channel's Expedition to Stonehenge

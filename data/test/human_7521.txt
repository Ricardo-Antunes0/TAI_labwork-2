Marguerite (April 24, 1920 - October 27, 1945) was an American Thoroughbred racemare owned by Belair Stud who had to be retired after only one start but who established her place in racing history as the dam of four significant runners. A broodmare's place in racing history A 1946 Daily Racing Form article lamented the fact that when a sire of one or more outstanding runners dies there will be much written about that stallion in country's all over the world. Conversely, when a mare who has produced similar such successful offspring, scant little will be reported on her accomplishment. That same article recounted a story by the sports Editor of the Atlanta Journal about his visit to Claiborne Farm and the gravesite of Marguerite. The Daily Racing Form commented that Arthur Hancock telling the reporter he was saving a space next to her for Sir Gallahad III was "one of the most romantic stories in the annals of the world's turf".

Railroad police or railway police (also called Bulls), are persons responsible for the protection of railroad (or railway) properties, facilities, revenue and personnel, as well as carried passengers and cargo. Railroad police may also patrol public rail transit systems. Their exact roles differs from country to country. In some countries railroad police are no different from any other police agency, while in others they are more like security police. Some are given extensive additional authority, while those in other jurisdictions are more restricted. In the United States and Canada, railroad police are employed by the major Class I railroads, as well as some smaller ones. In other countries, this work is typically done by territorial police forces rather than specialized agencies. In the United Kingdom, railways fall under the jurisdiction of the British Transport Police, a national transit police force that is responsible for policing all railways and some public transit systems in the Britain.

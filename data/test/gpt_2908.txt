NI Railways, also known as Northern Ireland Railways, was a railway company in Northern Ireland.  NI Railways was formed on 1 January 1923 as a result of the amalgamation of the Belfast and County Down Railway (later the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway) with the Ulster Railway. In 1948, it became part of British Railways when Northern Ireland was partitioned into the Northern Ireland Civil Service and the Irish Free State. The company was privatized in 1987 and was subsequently renamed First NI Railways. It was subsequently rebranded as Irish Rail in 2002. On 2 May 2007, it was merged with the Republic of Ireland's State Railways (Iarnród Éireann) to form Iarnrod Éireann.  NI Railways operated a network of lines that served most of Northern Ireland. The company also operated cross-border services into County Donegal in Ireland and County Monaghan in Republic of Ireland.

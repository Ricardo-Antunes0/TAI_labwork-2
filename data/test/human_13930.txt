The Anniston–Oxford metropolitan statistical area is the most populated metropolitan area in Northeast Alabama next to Huntsville.  At the 2000 census, it had a population of 112,249. The MSA is anchored by significant jobs at Jacksonville State University, the Northeast Alabama Regional Medical Center, Stringfellow Hospital, the Anniston Army Depot, and the Department of Homeland Security at McClellan. McClellan has transitioned from being a closed military base, to becoming the home of hundreds of residents, new retail growth such as a Lowe's Home Improvement Store, and now more than 3,000 jobs spread out over more than 20 employers.  Anniston remains strong in health care, legal, financial services and manufacturing. Oxford, with Interstate 20 running right through it, has developed a number of retail and restaurant establishments including the Oxford Exchange which is anchored by Target. Jacksonville is an important city in the region due to its student population and education resources at Jacksonville State University. The other cities surrounding Anniston–Oxford are Piedmont, Ohatchee, Hobson City, and Weaver.

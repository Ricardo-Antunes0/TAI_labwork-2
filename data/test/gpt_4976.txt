In music, a traps case or trap set is a type of drum set or cymbal set used in jazz, blues and other forms of improvised music. They are usually pitched in a low register, and are used to create a "thumping" or "bouncy" feel to the music.   Traps cases are also used in other genres of music such as metal, rock and country.

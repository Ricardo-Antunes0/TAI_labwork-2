The Midland Professional Championship is an annual golf tournament played in the English Midlands. The event is organised by the Midlands Region of the Professional Golfers' Association. It is the oldest tournament in professional golf having been first contested in 1897. It was originally organised by the Midland Counties Professional Golf Club, a forerunner of the PGA. For a number of years, until at least 1924, the Championship winner also received the Chance Challenge Cup. In 1911 the Midland Professional Championship and the Chance Challenge Cup were contested separately. The Midland Professional Championship was played on 6 April and served as the Midland section qualifying event for the Sphere and Tatler Foursomes Tournament, the winner receiving the Midland Challenge Cup. The Chance Challenge Cup was awarded to the winner of Midland section qualifying event for the News of the World Match Play, played on 13 September. Wilfrid Reid won the Midland Professional Championship (and with it, the Midland Challenge Cup) while Tom Williamson won the Chance Cup.

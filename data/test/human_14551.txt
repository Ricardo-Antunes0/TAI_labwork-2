Harbour (1979â€“1985) was a French Thoroughbred racehorse. In the early part of 1982 she appeared to establish herself as the best of an exceptionally strong group of French three-year-old fillies by winning the Prix Vanteaux, Prix Saint-Alary and Prix de Diane and decisively defeating rivals including All Along and Akiyda. Her form was less impressive in the autumn and was retired after a disappointing run in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Background Harbour was a "lightly-made" chestnut filly with a white blaze and four white socks bred and owned by the Head family's Ecurie Aland. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Arctic Tern, whose biggest win had been a victory over Exceller in the Prix Ganay. Arctic Tern went on to sire many other good winners including Bering and was the leading sire in France in 1986. Her dam Here's To You was a descendant of the American broodmare Warrior Lass, making her a distant relative of Bounding Home and Riva Ridge.

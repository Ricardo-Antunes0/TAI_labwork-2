Jia Baoyu (, and his surname is also romanized as Jia Baoyi) (; December 10, 1762 – September 26, 1822) was a Chinese scholar, philosopher, and poet.  Born in Beijing into a wealthy family of scholars and officials, Jia inherited his father's talent for learning and pursued an education in both the Confucian Classics and Western sciences. He became a noted philosopher and writer during the late Qing dynasty (1644–1911/12), championing the cause of reform and advocating for the emancipation of Chinese intellectuals. His works were instrumental in shaping the intellectual climate of the late imperial period and have had a lasting impact on Chinese intellectual history.  Jia is best known for his philosophical treatise "The Four Books", which introduced Western philosophy to China and has been influential in the development of modern Chinese thought. Jia also wrote poetry and prose, notably "Dream of the Red Chamber", which is one of the most famous novels in Chinese literature.

Nadroga (pronounced ), is a prominent dialect of the West Fijian languages spoken in mostly in the western region of the Fiji Islands. It is often used as the generic standard of West Fijian. It takes its name from the ancient region and modern day province of Nadroga/Navosa, in Viti Levu, an area already unique for its own material culture, language and beautiful landscapes. Known as one of the prestige dialects of Fiji (which include the dialects of Rewa, Cakaudrove and Lau), Nadroga is popularly identified, and sometimes lampooned, by the change of Standard Fijian 's' to 'h' and the turbulent pitch and rapidness in which the language is spoken and can widely be identified by non-speakers within Fiji as a result of those characteristics. It is a dialect that is less understood by native Fijian speakers due to different sounds and spelling of common words.(Becker E. Anne, 1995)  For example, the Fijian greeting word "bula" is "cola" in Nadroga/Navosa dialect. Geography and Distribution

The RIBA Journal, (often known simply as the RIBAJ), is an architecture magazine and website published by the Royal Institute of British Architects, based in London. It has the largest circulation of any UK-originating architecture magazine. Alongside the monthly publication in print, the online edition is updated daily and has additional content. History  The RIBA has issued publications since its foundation in 1834, and the magazine evolved from these. It was established in 1893 as the Journal of proceedings of the Royal Institute of British Architects and was the same year renamed Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects or simply The RIBA Journal. Until World War II it appeared fortnightly, then monthly. Until the 1940s it was usual for the RIBA Librarian also to be editor of the RIBA Journal. A notable example was Edward 'Bobby' Carter, from 1930-1946. From 1986 to 1987 it was rebranded The Architect: The Journal of the RIBA, then reverted to its previous title.

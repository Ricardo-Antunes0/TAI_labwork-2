Eva Cohn Galambos (July 1, 1928 â€“ March 24, 1997) was a Hungarian-born American mathematician and physicist who worked in the areas of mechanics, fluid dynamics, and mathematical physics.  Born in Hungary, Eva Galambos emigrated to the United States with her family in 1940. She completed her undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago in 1948 and obtained her PhD from Princeton University in 1957. Galambos worked at the University of California, Davis from 1957 to 1961, before joining the faculty at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. She was a fellow of the American Mathematical Society and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Galambos retired from Rutgers in 1993.  Galambos authored or co-authored over 200 papers on a variety of mathematical topics, including mechanics, fluid dynamics, and mathematical physics. She also published two books on mathematical subjects: "Foundations of Differential Equations" (1973) and "The Theory of Partial Differential Equations" (1981).  Galambos died from cancer at the age of 71.

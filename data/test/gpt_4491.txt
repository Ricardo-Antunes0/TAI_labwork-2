The GreinerMurray ministry (199192) or Second GreinerMurray ministry was the tenth and final ministry of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) led by Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. The ministry was composed of 15 members, including four female ministers, and lasted for one year and nine months.  The GreinerMurray ministry was notable for its attempt to end the Keating government's economic recession. The government introduced a number of bills, including the Economic Reconstruction Package (ERP), which aimed to stimulate the economy by increasing government expenditure and reducing taxes. The ERP was criticised by some members of the ALP as being too expensive and not effective, but it helped to improve economic conditions in Australia by late 1991.  The GreinerMurray ministry also had a number of other important accomplishments, including the passage of the Family Law Act 1991, which changed the law relating to divorce and family law in Australia. The government also announced plans to privatise several state-owned companies, including Qantas Airways and Telecom Australia. However, some of these initiatives were later abandoned by the Keating government.  The GreinerMurray ministry was eventually overthrown in late 1992 by the Keating government, which had regained power at the 1991 election. This led to Hawke's retirement from politics and the end of the ALP's eleven-year period of majority government.

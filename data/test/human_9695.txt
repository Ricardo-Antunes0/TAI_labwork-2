Antonius Jozef Maria "Anton" Berns (born January 1945, Schijndel) is a Dutch scientist researching molecular genetics and author of the Mouse Cancer Models studies series. Career  Anton Berns studied biochemistry at the University of Nijmegen and received his master's degree in 1969 (cum laude) and his PhD in 1972 (supervisor Prof. H. Bloemendal) from that same university (cum laude). He did his postdoctoral training in the group of Rudolf Jaenisch at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, CA., where he studied the role of retroviruses in causing lymphomas in mice. In 1976 he returned to the University of Nijmegen where he became junior staff member. His group explored proviral insertional mutagenesis as a means to identify new oncogenes. In 1985 he was appointed as staff scientist at the Netherlands Cancer Institute and in 1986 he became head of the Division of Molecular Genetics of the institute. Here his group did pioneering work to generate and utilize genetically modified mice as a tool to search for new cancer genes.

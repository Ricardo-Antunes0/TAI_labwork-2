A mitre joint (often miter in American English) is a type of joint used in woodworking. It is a type of butt joint, and is formed when two boards are clamped together at the edge opposite the miter cut, and the end of one board is cut to fit within the end of the other. There is a rabbet (rounded shoulder) created on each side of the joint.

Raleigh Adelbert Black (11 March 1880 â€“ 2 July 1963) was an Australian botanist and public servant best known for his large private herbarium, most of which is housed at the National Herbarium of Victoria. His collection of Tasmanian plants is considered one of the largest and most representative collections of Tasmanian flora from the first half of the twentieth century. Early life Black was born in Bothwell, Tasmania, the son of Rev. Dr Joseph Black who was an immigrant from Aberdeen, Scotland.  Raleigh fell from a swing as a young child and suffered a head injury. After this, while physically strong, he complained of headaches. He was rebellious and difficult to handle at home and school so his parents took him to a doctor, who suggested he would be better suited to work than school. At the age of twelve, Black began working for the Tasmanian News as a printer's devil, then bookbinder and eventually as a typesetter. Still in his teens, he worked as a clerical assistant for the Treasury Department of the Tasmanian Government and developed an excellent memory by taking a mail-order memory training course through the New York Institute of Science.

"Home" is a 2007 song by American rock band Daughtry from their self-titled debut album. The song had been climbing up the U.S. charts for a few weeks before the song was announced as the second single from the album. The song was covered by Irish musician Kian Egan that serves as the lead single from his debut album also called Home. Song meaning  Chris Daughtry told Entertainment Weekly: "I had already made it through to Hollywood, but I’m still at home at this point, because once you make it through auditions there’s this whole torturous waiting period. And I got in that mindset of what this is going to be like. I’m going to be away from my family for the first time and I’m not working a job anymore. This is weird. I was wrapping my head around something a little more radio friendly and just started strumming and wrote “Home” within 15 to 20 minutes. I played it for (then-RCA Records CEO) Clive Davis once I was off the show and had a meeting with him. I played it in front of him with my guitar and he pretty much signed me on the spot."

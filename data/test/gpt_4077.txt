Sanders' Knoxville Raid (June 14â€“24, 1863) saw Union forces led by General Ambrose E. Burnside raid the city of Knoxville, Tennessee, in order to seize Confederate General John Hunt Morgan and his command.  The raid was a costly failure, with Union casualties numbering 2,718 killed, wounded, and missing, as opposed to Morgan's reported loss of 21 men. The raid also led to the burning of the city of Knoxville and the eventual Confederate victory in the Battle of Knoxville.

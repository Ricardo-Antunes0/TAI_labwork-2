The Peaceful River is a remote stream in the interior of Alaska. It is a tributary of the Copper River, flowing for 220 miles (350 km) before merging with it. The Peaceful River was long considered to be a wild and dangerous place, with rapids and cascades making it difficult to navigate. However, in the early 21st century, the Peaceful River was brought under state protection and is now a popular destination for fly-fishing and rafting.

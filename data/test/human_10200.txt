Potato salad is a dish made from boiled potatoes and a variety of other ingredients. It is generally considered a side dish, as it usually accompanies the main course. Potato salad is widely believed to have originated in Germany, spreading largely throughout Europe, European colonies and later Asia. American potato salad most likely originated from recipes brought to the U.S. by way of German and other European immigrants during the nineteenth century. American-style potato salad is served cold or at room temperature. Ingredients often include mayonnaise or a mayonnaise-like substitute (such as yogurt or sour cream), herbs, and vegetables (such as onion and celery). Asian-style potato salad is similar to American-style potato salad, but has a sweeter and eggier flavor. Japanese potato salad ("potesara")  There is a different variation of potato salad in Japan also known as "potesara". It traditionally consists of mashed boiled potatoes, cucumber, onion, carrot, boiled eggs, and ham mixed with Kewpie mayonnaise, rice vinegar, and karashi mustard. It is believed that the Japanese version of potato salad is derived from the Russian Olivier salad, which was inspired by Western culture. From 1633 to 1853, Japan's borders were closed to foreign influence under the isolationist foreign policy known as Sakoku. After the Kanagawa Treaty, the ban was lifted, and, during the Meiji Restoration, Western customs began to influence parts of Japanese culture such as its cuisine.

The Tuareg Rebellion of 2012 was an armed rebellion by the Tuareg people of Mali against the Malian government and its French and African allies. The rebellion lasted for over a year, until a negotiated peace was signed in September 2013.  The Tuareg Rebellion began in early 2012, when rebels attacked military outposts and checkpoints in the north of the country. The rebels claimed that they were fighting for autonomy and an end to discrimination by the Malian government. By the end of the year, rebel forces had seized control of most of the north of Mali. In September 2013, a negotiated peace was signed between the rebels and the Malian government, ending the rebellion.

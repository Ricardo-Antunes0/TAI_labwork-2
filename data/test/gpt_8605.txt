Forestry in India is a significant rural and urban sector with diverse land uses. Forests cover about 20% of the country's geographical area, making it the third largest forested country in the world. The forests are a major source of livelihood for the rural population, and provide timber, fuelwood, fodder and other products.  The Indian Forestry Commission has been active in forestry since 1912. The commission has responsibility for planning, implementing and regulating forestry activities in the country. Forest products are exported from India to countries in Asia, Europe, and North America. India is also a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Despite its importance, forestry in India faces several challenges. The main ones are:  -Lack of awareness about the importance of forests  -Inadequate funding for forestry  -Inappropriate land use patterns  -Damage to forests by humans and natural disasters

Danielle Jane Minogue (born 20 October 1971) is an Australian singer, actress, and television personality. She initially gained recognition for her appearances on the television talent show Young Talent Time (1982–1988) and for her role as Emma Jackson on the soap opera Home and Away (1989–1990). Minogue began her music career in the early 1990s, achieving early success with her debut studio album, Love and Kisses (1991), which included the singles "Love and Kisses", "Baby Love", "Jump to the Beat" and "Success". Following the release of her second studio album, Get into You (1993), Minogue's popularity as a singer had declined, only producing one successful single "This Is It". This led her to make a name for herself with award-winning performances in the stage shows Grease (1997), Notre-Dame de Paris (1999), The Vagina Monologues and Macbeth (both 2000). The late 1990s saw a brief return to music after Minogue reinvented herself as a dance artist with her third studio album, Girl (1997), and its lead single "All I Wanna Do". Her fourth studio album, Neon Nights (2003), became the most successful of her career and produced the hit singles "I Begin to Wonder", "Who Do You Love Now?" and "Put the Needle on It". In the UK, Minogue has achieved 13 consecutive number one dance singles, becoming the best-performing artist on the UK Dance Chart. She has had a total of nine UK Top 10 singles, twelve Top 30 singles in Australia, thirteen UK club Number 1 singles, six Gold certified singles in Australia and has sold over 8 million records worldwide. Her fifth studio album, Club Disco, was released in 2007.

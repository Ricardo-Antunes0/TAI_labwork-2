The USC Trojans baseball program represents the University of Southern California in college baseball. Established in 1888, the team is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Pac-12 Conference.  USC’s home field is Dedeaux Field, which is named in honor of former head coach and National College Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Rod Dedeaux. The USC Trojans are one of the most successful programs in the history of college baseball. The Trojans have won more baseball national championships than any other program across all divisions of college baseball. With 12 national championships, USC is far and away the leader in that category; no other Division I school has more than six. As of June 14, 2021, USC also ranked fifth in all-time College World Series (CWS) appearances with 21, trailing only Texas (37), Miami (FL) (25), Florida State (23), and Arizona State (22). The Trojans have won more individual CWS games (74) than any program but Texas (85). USC also ranks fourth in all-time NCAA Tournament wins with 173—trailing only Texas (245), Florida State (199), and Miami (194)—and 10th in total NCAA Tournament appearances with 37.

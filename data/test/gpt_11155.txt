The Southern Gas Corridor is an initiative to develop a gas pipeline network connecting Russia and central Europe with southern Europe. The project is promoted by the European Union and is estimated to cost up to $40 billion.  The Southern Gas Corridor would create a route for importing Russian gas to Europe, bypassing Ukraine and Poland. The project has been controversial, with concerns about its environmental and economic implications. In March 2016, the European Commission announced that it was suspending its involvement in the project, pending a review.

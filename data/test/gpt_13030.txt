De Vliert  is a multi-use stadium in Heerlen, Netherlands. It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home ground of Heerlen FC. The stadium has a capacity of 8,000 people.  The stadium was built in 1928 and was originally used as a sports ground. It was later used as a stadium for Heerlen's football club, who played in the Dutch second division. The stadium saw its first major action during the 1988–89 Eredivisie season, when Heerlen played their first-ever European match against Manchester United.  In 2001, the stadium underwent an extensive renovation, which increased its capacity to 8,000 people. The renovation also saw the installation of new seating and a new roof. In 2009, the stadium was again renovated, this time in order to improve its facilities for concerts and other events. The project cost €2 million and saw the installation of new stage equipment and a new lighting system.

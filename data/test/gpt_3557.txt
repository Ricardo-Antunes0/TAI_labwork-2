The human gene VKORC1 encodes for the protein vesicular kinesin-1. This protein is responsible for the transport of cargo within cells. In humans, VKORC1 is located on chromosome 16.  VKORC1 was first identified in 1993 and was initially believed to be a gene that coded for a protein that helped control the movement of cells. However, subsequent research has shown that VKORC1 is actually responsible for the transport of cargo within cells. Specifically, this gene is responsible for the transport of proteins and other materials within cells.  Since VKORC1 is responsible for the transport of important materials within cells, it has been shown to be important in a number of different biological processes. For example, VKORC1 has been shown to be important in the process of cell migration. Additionally, VKORC1 has also been shown to be important in the process of cell division.  As such, VKORC1 is an essential gene and is critical for the proper functioning of many different biological processes.

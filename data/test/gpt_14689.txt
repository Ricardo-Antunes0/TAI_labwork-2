Rollinia is a genus of plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Africa, Madagascar, and the Seychelles. The genus is named for the German botanist Friedrich Gottlieb Rollius.  Rollinia is a genus of about 100 species of trees and shrubs, mostly found in tropical Africa and Madagascar, but also on the Seychelles. The plants are evergreen or semi-evergreen, with simple leaves and solitary flowers that are usually white or pink. The fruit is a drupe.  The genus is best known for two species that are used as ornamental plants: the white-hot poker (Rollinia ananassae), which grows to 7 meters tall and has white flowers; and the Madagascar mahogany (Rollinia madagascariensis), which grows to 15 meters tall and has red flowers.

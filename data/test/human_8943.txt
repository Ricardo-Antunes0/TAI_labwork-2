The Kashima Gatalympics is an event held in the mudflats of the Ariake Sea off Kashima city in Saga Prefecture, Japan. The event takes place every year at the end of May. Participants compete in novelty games such as the mud sumo tournament, the 25m dash and the surf board race. The Ariake Sea has a tidal range of six metres, which on a low tide, exposes the mudflats on which the games take place. It has become a well known event throughout the Saga Prefecture with around 300 athletes participating each year. History When the prefecture plan for Saga was published in 1984, it was decided that Kashima City would not have a highway or a Shinkansen connection. Mr. Masahiko Kuwahara, the mayor of Kashima, was also the president of the junior chamber. He created a committee called "Forum Kashima" to improve the city's cultural calendar. As a result, the 1st Kashima Gatalympic event was held on May 3, 1985.

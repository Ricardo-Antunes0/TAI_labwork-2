In 1880, the British colonial administration of Cyprus established a gendarmerie force to improve law and order on the island. The Cyprus Military Police (CMP) continues to serve as the island's principal law enforcement agency. The CMP is a professional police force with a strength of 1,000 personnel. Its duties include providing security for government buildings and personnel, quelling civil unrest, and conducting investigations.

Greenville-Pickens Speedway is a race track located in Easley, South Carolina, just west of Greenville, South Carolina. The track hosts weekly NASCAR sanctioned races. Several NASCAR touring series have raced at the track in prior years, including the Whelen Southern Modified Tour and the NASCAR Grand National Division. NASCAR Cup Series and Xfinity Series teams frequently tested at the track until 2015, when all private testing was banned. The Upper South Carolina State Fair has been held at the fairgrounds adjacent to the race track since 1964. Capacity of the track is 35,000 including the Dale Earnhardt backstretch, a three-tiered parking area where fans can take in races while tailgating or camping. The track held 28 races on the NASCAR Grand National tour between 1955 until 1971. It also hosted two NASCAR Busch Grand National (now Xfinity Series) tour races in 1983. The April 10, 1971 race at Greenville-Pickens Speedway was the first NASCAR race nationally televised from start to finish, on ABC Wide World of Sports.

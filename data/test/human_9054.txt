The Quake II engine''' is a game engine developed by id Software for use in their 1997 first-person shooter Quake II. It is the successor to the Quake engine. Since its release, the Quake II engine has been licensed for use in several other games. One of the engine's most notable features was out-of-the-box support for hardware-accelerated graphics, specifically OpenGL, along with the traditional software renderer. Another interesting feature was the subdivision of some of the components into dynamic-link libraries. This allowed both software and OpenGL renderers, which were selected by loading and unloading separate libraries. Libraries were also used for the game logic, for two reasons: id could release the source code to allow modifications while keeping the remainder of the engine proprietary. Since they were compiled for specific platforms, instead of an interpreter, they could run faster than Quakes solution, which was to run the game logic (QuakeC) in a limited interpreter.

Subatomic Sound System, founded in 1999 by Stefan Kühn, is a Berlin-based electronic music duo.  The duo is composed of Stefan Kühn (born 1963) on synthesizers, electronics and drum machines, and drummer Simon Grau (born 1966).  The duo's music is characterised by its use of microtonal scales and psychedelic textures. It has been compared to that of contemporaries such as Aphex Twin and Autechre.

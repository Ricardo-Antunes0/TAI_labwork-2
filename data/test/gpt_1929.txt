The Joint European Torus, or JET, is a proposed nuclear fusion reactor, initially conceived in the early 1990s by the European Union. JET would be the world's largest and most powerful magnetic confinement plasma reactor, and is intended to produce energy via theburning of deuterium and tritium in a doughnut-shaped plasma chamber.  The JET project has been plagued by financial, technical, and political difficulties throughout its history. In October 2018, the European Commission announced that it was suspending funding for JET, citing "significant risks" to its future.

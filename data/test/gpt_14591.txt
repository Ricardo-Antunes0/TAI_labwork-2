A community school  in the Republic of Ireland is a type of secondary school which caters for pupils from the surrounding community, rather than just the pupils of one or more schools within the local area.  Community schools were first introduced in Ireland in 2002, following a review which recommended that such schools be established in order to improve social cohesion and provide a more inclusive education for pupils. Community schools are not part of the national curriculum, but focus on providing a broad range of educational opportunities which encourage pupils to develop their personal strengths and talents.  There are currently 53 community schools in Ireland, all of which are located in counties Cork, Donegal, Dublin, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Newfoundland and Labrador, Roscommon and Sligo.

Karissa Y. Sanbonmatsu is an American structural biologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. She works on the mechanism of non-coding RNA complexes including the ribosome, riboswitches, long non-coding RNAs, as well as chromatin. She was the first to perform an atomistic simulation of the ribosome, determine the secondary structure of an intact lncRNA and to publish a one billion atom simulation of a biomolecular complex. Education and early career  Sanbonmatsu was born in Rochester, New York, the daughter of Joan Loveridge-Sanbonmatsu, and Akira Loveridge-Sanbonmatsu, who are both professors of speech communication in the State University of New York. She attended Oswego High School, and was valedictorian. She won the Pembroke College Stokes Society Scientific Lecture Competition at the University of Cambridge. Sanbonmatsu studied physics at Columbia University, where she used the Very Large Array radio telescope to estimate the distance to supernova remnant G27.4+0.0 and its central X-ray source, which is now known to be a magnetar. Karissa's early research was in plasma physics. She earned her PhD in astrophysical sciences at University of Colorado Boulder under Martin V. Goldman (a student of Donald F. Dubois). Her dissertation entailed analytical treatments of non-linear wave-wave interactions in plasmas, elucidating the competition between Langmuir wave-wave and wave-particle effects in the auroral ionosphere.  In 1997, after earning her doctorate, Sanbonmatsu joined Los Alamos National Laboratory as a postdoctoral scholar under Donald F. Dubois (a student of Murray Gell-Mann), determining the effect of kinetic processes on Langmuir waves in plasmas. She became interested in what distinguishes life from matter. In 2002 Los Alamos built Q-machine, one of the world's fastest supercomputer. The Q-machine allowed Sanbonmatsu to run the world's largest simulation in biology, publishing the first simulation of the ribosome in 2005, where she identified the “accommodation corridor” of the ribosome.

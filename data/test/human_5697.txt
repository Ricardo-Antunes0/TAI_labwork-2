The Battle of Okpo was a battle which took place during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592â€“98). Yi Sun-sin and Won Gyun's fleet destroyed an anchored Japanese transport fleet. It was the first naval battle of the Imjin War and the first victory of Admiral Yi against the Japanese naval fleet of Todo Takatora. A day later, after destroying an additional 18 Japanese transports in nearby waters, Yi Sun-sin and Won Gyun parted ways and returned to their home ports after receiving news of the fall of Hanseong. The Battle of Okpo caused anxiety and nervousness among the Japanese, because afterward Yi began to deploy his navy to attack Japanese supply and carrier vessels. Yi's headquarters were at Yeosu, which is west of Namhae Island of the southern coast of Korea. The surrounding area of Okpo and Yeosu is dotted with numerous islands and narrow straits. It is in this area where many of the naval battles in which Yi defeated the Japanese took place.

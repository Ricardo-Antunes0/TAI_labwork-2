Jean Colombe (; b. Bourges ca. 1430; d. 1493) was a French composer, singer, and religious writer. He is considered the leading composer of the early Renaissance era.  Jean Colombe was born in Bourges ca. 1430. He probably received his early musical training in his native town, where he is believed to have been a choirboy of the cathedral. He entered the service of the duke of Berry in 1452, and became court composer to the young Louis XI in 1461. In 1473 he was made a canon of Notre Dame de Paris, and four years later he resigned his position as court composer to become vice-chancellor of the royal chapel.  Colombe's chief work as a composer is the opera "Le Meurtre de Maître Fournier" (1475), which marks a definite departure from the style of Jean Froissart and other earlier French composers. The libretto is by Colombe's friend Pierre de La Rue. It tells the story of Samson and Delilah, with music based on biblical stories. The opera was a great success, and its influence is still felt in late works of the baroque period.  In addition to "Le Meurtre de Maître Fournier", Colombe wrote numerous secular cantatas, motets, chansons, and psalms. He also wrote religious works, including five books of spiritual songs known as "Te Deums".

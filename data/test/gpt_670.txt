Ince Castle is three miles (5Â km) from the town of Ince in Cheshire, England. It is an early 16th-century fortified manor house, which is now a hotel.   The castle was built by the Nevilles in the late 1480s, on the site of an earlier fortification. It was acquired by the Howard family in 1561, and passed through several other hands before being purchased by the Ince Castle Hotel Company in 1923. The hotel has been run since then by the same family, who have made it one of Cheshire's most popular tourist attractions.   The castle is a Grade II* listed building.

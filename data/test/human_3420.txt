Louis Reid Deuchars (1870–1927) was a Scottish artist and sculptor.   Born in Comrie, Perthshire, Scotland, he attended Glasgow School of Art from 1887 to 1888.  During his time in the city he was working as a stained-glass painter, possibly for a firm of decorators, such as J & W Guthrie. His series of lithographs, 'Picturesque Glasgow' was published in 'The Bailie' (1893–95). After sending a selection of his drawings to George Frederic Watts, 'England's Michelangelo', Deuchars secured work as an assistant to Watts at Compton, Surrey, England, where he worked on Watts' sculptures Physical Energy and Lord Tennyson. However, his main employment there was as one of the four main workers assisting Mrs Watts, Mary Fraser Tytler, with her Watts Mortuary Chapel from 1895 to 1900.  He helped her to run the classes attended by the local villagers, who modelled the decorative terra cotta tiles for the chapel. Then he went on in 1900 to do the same job at the Aldourie Pottery, Dores, her enterprise in the Highlands.  It was near her childhood home of Aldourie Castle, Inverness-shire.  During his association with the Wattses, he learned how to submit works to major art exhibitions & sold several. Following that he was assistant to the sculptor Sir William Goscombe John in St John's Wood, London. Then he moved to be assistant to another sculptor, William Robert Colton at Hughenden, near High Wycombe.

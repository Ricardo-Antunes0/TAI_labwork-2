The Harlem Artists Guild (1935â€“41) was an organization of African-American painters, sculptors, and printmakers. The Guild was founded in 1935 by a group of Harlem artists who felt that there was a need for an organization that would represent their interests and work together to promote their art. The Guild held its first exhibition in 1936 and continued to exhibit throughout the 1930s and 1940s. The Guild was significant because it was one of the first organizations of African-American artists to be formed and it helped to foster the artistic talent of its members.

Life Purgaz was named in the Russian chronicles several times. In January, 1229 his army repulsed a raid of the Russian princes Yaroslav Vsevolodovich, Vasily Konstantinovich and Vsevolod Konstantinovich. Then Purgaz defeated the Mokshan prince, Puresh. In April, 1229 he tried to regain Nizhny Novgorod from the hands of Zalesyean Rus', which was formerly the Erzyan settlement of Obran Osh.

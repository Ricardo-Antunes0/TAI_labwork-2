Cecilia Helena Payne-Gaposchkin (née Payne;  – 2 December 2018) was a British mathematical physicist. She was the first woman to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics.  Born in London, Payne-Gaposchkin studied at University College London, where she received her BSc in mathematics in 1939. In 1941 she moved to Cambridge, where she received her PhD in 1948 for her work on the statistical properties of fluids. After briefly working at the National Physical Laboratory, she became a professor at the University of Cambridge in 1956. She retired from her position there in 1988, but continued to work until her death.  Payne-Gaposchkin is best known for her work on the theory of intense laser beams, which led to her being awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1993. She also made important contributions to the theory of black holes and quantum field theory.

John Evans Freke-Aylmer (23 February 1838 – 10 January 1912) was a British artist and writer on art. He is most noted for his book The Origin of British Art, which is still considered a seminal work on the subject.  Freke-Aylmer was born in London, the son of the artist John Evans and his wife Louisa Freke. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained his BA in 1866 and MA in 1869. He then travelled to Italy, where he studied under Giulio Cesare Procaccini and Jean-Léon Gérôme.  In 1872, Freke-Aylmer returned to England and set up a studio in London. He became well-known for his portraits and paintings of classical subjects, many of which were exhibited at the Royal Academy. He also wrote several books on art, including The Origin of British Art (1898), The Age of Augustus (1901), and The Renaissance (1906). He died in London in 1912.

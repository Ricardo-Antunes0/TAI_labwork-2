Bas 60 (Flygbassystem 60, Air Base System 60) was an air base system developed and used by the Swedish Air Force during the Cold War. The system was based around defensive force dispersal of aircraft and its supporting ground operations across many krigsflygbaser (wartime air bases) in case of war, primarily as a protective measure against nuclear weapons. The purpose of the system was to make it complicated for an opponent to destroy the Swedish Air Force on the ground and thus ensure endurance for the air force in a conflict scenario. The plan was to disperse the air units so one krigsflygbas would house one squadron (8-12 aircraft). This dispersion principle also applied to the individual wartime bases themselves, meaning that the various functions of an air base were spread over a large area in and around the base. The system originated from an air force inquiry in 1954 and was formally implemented in the 1958 defence plan. The original plan called for 70 wartime air bases to be built, with 46 of them to be equipped for continuous usage. The number of bases was however reduced with every revision of the plan and about 40 bases ended up being completed.

MathWorld is an online mathematics reference work, founded in 1994. The site contains more than 1,600 articles on topics such as calculus, geometry, algebra, number theory, and statistics. It is also the home of the MathWorld Encyclopedia, an online encyclopedia of mathematics.  MathWorld is maintained by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), a research institute based at Stanford University in California. The MSRI is a private non-profit organization.  MathWorld was originally conceived as a repository for mathematical articles that could be accessed by anyone with an internet connection. However, over time the site has evolved into a comprehensive reference work covering a broad range of mathematics topics. In addition to providing comprehensive coverage of mathematical topics, MathWorld also features a wide variety of user-generated content, including problem sets and video tutorials.  MathWorld is free to use and accessible via the web.

The Kentucky River Authority is an agency of the Commonwealth of Kentucky responsible for the regulation and management of the Kentucky River. The authority was created by the Kentucky River Water Resources Development Act of 1988 and is headquartered in Erlanger.  The Kentucky River is one of the longest rivers in the United States, running for 418 miles from its headwaters in the Appalachian Mountains to its confluence with the Ohio River near Paducah. The river provides water resources for more than one million people and is a major transportation route linking eastern Kentucky, northern Alabama, and Tennessee with central and southern Ohio. The authority is responsible for developing a comprehensive strategy for managing the river, including water supply, flood control, navigation, environmental protection, economic development, and recreation.

The Battle of Beverwijk  (Dutch: "Slag bij Beverwijk") was a battle fought on July 8, 1672, during the Franco-Dutch War, near Beverwijk in the Dutch province of North Holland.  The French army under Marshal Turenne advanced to besiege the Dutch fortress of Beverwijk. The Dutch commander, the Count of Nassau-Weilburg, was able to divert some French troops from the siege to meet this new threat and withdrew behind the river Rhine. A French counterattack was able to break through the Dutch lines, resulting in a disastrous defeat for the Dutch.

Dracoraptor (meaning "dragon thief") is a genus of theropod dinosaurs that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, about 73 to 71 million years ago.  The Dracoraptor genus was first described by Xu Xing in 1993. The type and only known species is Dracoraptor gui. It is known from a single fossil specimen, which was uncovered in the Gansu Province of China. The skull is incomplete, but it is thought to be around three feet long and have a wingspan of around six feet.  The Dracoraptor genus is unusual among theropods in that it has a long snout and a small tooth row on the upper jaw. These features may have been used to capture prey or scavenge meat from carcasses. The teeth of Dracoraptor are also unusually shaped, being triangular in cross-section.  The diet of Dracoraptor is unknown, but it is possible that it preyed on smaller dinosaurs or other small animals.

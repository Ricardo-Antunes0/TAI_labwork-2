The United Front was a coalition government in India between the Congress and the Muslim League, which lasted from December 1947 to May 1950. It was created in response to the Muslim League's demand for a separate homeland for Muslims in India. The United Front was successful in keeping the country together during its first years, but it eventually broke down because of disagreements over policy.

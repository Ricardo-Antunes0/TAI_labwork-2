Otto H. Königsberger (13 October 1908 – 6 December 1986) was a German mathematician.  Königsberger was born in Berlin, Germany on 13 October 1908. He studied at the University of Berlin and completed his doctorate in 1931 under the supervision of Max Born. From 1931 to 1936 he was a research fellow at the University of Cambridge. After returning to Berlin, he became an associate professor at the University of Berlin in 1937 and a full professor in 1946. He served as president of the Max Planck Society from 1967 to 1971. Königsberger died on 6 December 1986 in Berlin.  Königsberger is best known for his work in mathematical analysis, including the study of partial differential equations, Fourier analysis, and functional analysis. His book "An Introduction to Functional Analysis" (1952) is widely considered to be one of the classic texts in that field. He also made important contributions to operator theory and harmonic analysis.

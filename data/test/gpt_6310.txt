Quantitative proteomics is an analytical chemistry technique used to study the proteome, a complete set of proteins in a sample. Proteins are typically identified by mass spectrometry and subjected to a variety of post-processing steps to determine their precise protein composition. Quantitative proteomics can provide insight into the protein function and structure and has been used to identify new disease-related proteins.

Feudal fascism, also revolutionary-feudal totalitarianism, were official policies of fascist governments in Italy, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and Argentina during the 1930s and 1940s. They were based on the idea that a strongman, or dictator, was necessary to unify the country and restore order after years of political instability.  Fascist regimes promoted a strong central government with a strong leader at its head, combined with a strong military and an aggressive foreign policy. They also promoted a strict social hierarchy, with the elite protected by a powerful military and police force. Rural areas were divided into organized villages under the direction of local leaders who wereanswerable to the state. Industries were nationalized and workers were tightly regulated. Religious belief was discouraged and the use of Latin was promoted in schools.  Feudal fascism was abandoned in most countries after World War II, but it remained in power in Argentina until 1976.

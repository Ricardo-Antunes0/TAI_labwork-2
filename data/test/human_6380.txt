John E. Simonett (July 12, 1924 â€“ July 28, 2011) was an attorney and associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court. He was famous for his wit and thoughtfulness, characteristics reflected both in his judicial opinions, and in his writings and speeches. In 2007, he was named one of the 100 most influential attorneys in Minnesota history. Of his six daughters and sons, two became judges, one serving as the fourth Chief Judge of the Minnesota Court of Appeals from 1994 to 1995. Background John Simonett was born to Edward and Veronica Simonett on July 12, 1924 in Mankato, Minnesota, and was raised in nearby Le Center. He attended St. John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota, but his studies were interrupted by World War II. After three years in the U.S. Army, he was ordered to the Philippines as an infantry lieutenant just as the war was coming to a close.  Upon his discharge, he returned to St. John's, graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1948.  He entered the University of Minnesota Law School, where he graduated as one of the top students in his class in 1951 after serving as the president of the Minnesota Law Review. He then entered private practice in Little Falls, Minnesota, with Gordon Rosenmeier. Rosenmeier was already a well-respected state senator and attorney, and Simonett soon became a well-respected trial attorney. He also became known as a colorful commentator on the law and culture, through articles such as "The Common Law of Morrison County" in 1963, which recited myths about legal rights and duties in small-town America. He also took on more serious and complex topics, writing an influential law review article in 1977 on the use of partial settlements of multi-defendant civil suits. In 1980, when Little Falls native Walter F. Rogosheske retired from the Minnesota Supreme Court, Governor Al Quie appointed Simonett to fill the vacancy.

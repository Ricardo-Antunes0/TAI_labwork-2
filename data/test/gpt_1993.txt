The Association for Cooperative Operations Research and Development (ACORD) is a nonprofit international membership organization that promotes best practices in cooperative research. ACORD's members are researchers, practitioners, and educators working in the field of cooperative research.  Cooperative research is a type of research in which scientists from different institutions cooperate to solve a problem. The benefits of cooperative research include greater knowledge and understanding of the problem, faster completion of the project, and reduced costs.  ACORD was founded in 1961 as the Association for Advanced Cooperative Research. The name was changed to ACORD in 1978, in recognition of the increasing use of cooperative methods throughout the business world. Today, ACORD has more than 9,000 members from more than 100 countries.  ACORD's mission is to promote best practices in cooperative research and to serve as a forum for exchanging information and ideas on cooperative research issues. ACORD also provides resources and support to its members, including annual conferences, publications, and online resources.

The African golden cat (Caracal aurata) is a large African wildcat. The first specimens were collected in the Congo in 1922, and the species was first described by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1925.  The African golden cat is found mainly in woodlands, but also inhabits open savannah and montane forests. It is a solitary animal that typically feeds on small mammals, birds, and reptiles. The African golden cat is threatened by habitat loss and hunting, and has been listed as a vulnerable species by the IUCN.

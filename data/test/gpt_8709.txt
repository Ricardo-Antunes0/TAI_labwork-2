Gliogenesis is the generation of non-neuronal glia from mesenchymal stem cells. It is a process that is important for the maintenance of tissue health and for the development of tissue types in the body.  Gliogenesis occurs when stem cells in the mesenchyme differentiate into glial cells. Glial cells are important for the maintenance of tissue structure and function, and are vital for the development of new tissue types. Gliogenesis is also important for repairing damage to tissues.  There are several different types of glial cells, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. Astrocytes are the most common type of glial cell, and they play an important role in the maintenance of nerve function. Oligodendrocytes are responsible for the production of myelin, a layer of insulation around nerve fibers. Microglia are responsible for the removal of damaged cells and debris from tissues.

Kieran Hebden (born September 1977), best known by his stage name Four Tet, is an English electronic musician. He is the founder, main producer, and sole member of the London-based experimental electronic music trio Benga.  Four Tet's earliest recordings—including appearances on the Hyperdub EPs "Rugged Inna Yard" (1998) and "Dubplate Dubplate" (1999)—were sparse, sparse productions featuring occasional samples and live instruments. These tracks were later assembled as the album "Kettering" (2001), which helped to pioneer the use of samples and looping in dubstep.  Four Tet's work with Benga has seen him explore a wider range of musical styles, from dubstep to techno to ambient dub to house. His 2009 album " Rounds" was cited by BBC Music as a key influence on the development of house music in the 2010s.  In 2016, Four Tet released his eighth studio album, "The Beautiful Future". It was described as an "exploration of soundscapes and rhythms that are both emotive and cerebral", and was met with critical acclaim.

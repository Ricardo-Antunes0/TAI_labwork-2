Prokopije or Procopius (;  or , c. 565 – c. 618 AD) was a Byzantine general and historian of the 7th century AD. He was born in the province of Moesia Inferior, and is best known as a military historian, writing a comprehensive history of the Byzantine Empire from its origins to his own time. He also wrote biographies of emperors and other notable figures.  Prokopije was born in the province of Moesia Inferior, in present-day Serbia. After serving in the army during the reigns of Justinian I and Maurice, he rose to prominence under Emperor Heraclius (610–641), serving as governor of Syria and Anatolia. In 614, he led a major offensive against the Arabs in Anatolia, which proved successful.  In 617, Prokopije was appointed as governor of Italy by Heraclius, where he soon became embroiled in a conflict with the local authorities. He unsuccessfully attempted to usurp the imperial throne from Heraclius in 621–22 and thereafter retired from public life. He died around 618 AD in his native province of Moesia Inferior.  Prokopije's work has been highly influential on later Byzantine historians, particularly John Malalas and George Akropolites. He has also been praised for his elegant prose style and for his attention to detail.

Cruel Melody is the debut album of American rock band Black Light Burns, released on June 5, 2007, through Ross Robinson's label I AM: WOLFPACK. The album is an outcome of frontman Wes Borland's efforts after his departure from Limp Bizkit in 2001, after which he took part in many projects such as Eat the Day and The Damning Well. After receiving additional inputs from then members Danny Lohner, Josh Freese and Josh Eustis, Cruel Melody was released in the spring of 2007. Background Wes Borland began writing in early 2004 a solo album of mainly melodic and esoteric material after he disbanded his projects such as Big Dumb Face, Eat the Day and The Damning Well but slightly before he rejoined Limp Bizkit in mid-2004. During this time Borland was offered the touring guitarist spot in Nine Inch Nails, and frontman Trent Reznor offered his opinions on the material as it was at the time. He encouraged Borland to "not sing like someone was asleep in the next room" and make it a heavier affair, while coincidentally Borland was changing the material slowly more into that. While the songs were written by Borland, he did have additional input from producer Danny Lohner, drummer Josh Freese (both ex-members of The Damning Well) and the keyboards and additional engineering were assisted by Josh Eustis.

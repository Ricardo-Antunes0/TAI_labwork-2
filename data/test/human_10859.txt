Planes of Conflict is an accessory for the second edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, published in 1995. Contents Planes of Conflict contains six maps and five manuals for use with the Planescape setting. The set details the Beastlands, Bytopia, Elysium, Carceri, Gehenna, and the Gray Waste. These planes provide the checks and balances that hold all the other planes within the great Planescape wheel in place, despite Law and Chaos trying to control these planes and swing the multiverse their way. Each of these planes drains the lawful and chaotic tendencies from the personalities of characters who spend time on them, each plane bending characters to its own form of neutrality. This set breaks down the nature, inhabitants, and ecosystems of these six worlds using the quotes, pictures, and slang in signature Planescape style, presenting information as a mixture of gossip, observation, and conjecture. The referee's manual concisely provides a foundation on which to build a game while leaving enough freedom to allow the referee to work creatively. The set includes four quick-start adventures that illustrate what these planes have to offer.

Kakatiya Kala Thoranam (also called Warangal Gate) is a historical arch in the Warangal district, of the Indian state of Telangana. The Warangal Fort has four ornamental gates which originally formed the gates to the destroyed great Shiva temple which are known as Kakatiya Kala Thoranam or Warangal Gates. The architectural feature of these historical arches of the Warangal Fort has been adopted as the symbol of the Kakatiya Dynasty and has been officially incorporated as the Emblem of Telangana for the state of Telangana. These gates or arches in the Warangal Fort are said to have similarities with gateways of the Sanchi stupa; this fact has been endorsed by many. The arch was built around 12th century during the rule of the Kakatiya dynasty. The Monument was included in the "tentative list" of UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Monument was submitted by the Permanent Delegation of India to UNESCO on 10/09/2010.

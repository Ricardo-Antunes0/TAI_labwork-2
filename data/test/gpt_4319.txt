The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) is a multilateral treaty negotiated by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and signed on April 14, 1994. It entered into force on January 1, 1995. The Agreement is a part of the WTO's TRIPS Agreement, which established the rules for intellectual property rights. The TRIPs Agreement covers a wide range of issues related to intellectual property rights, including patents, copyright, trade secrets, trademarks and geographical indications.  The TRIPS Agreement is an important part of the WTO's framework for protecting intellectual property rights. It establishes minimum standards for these rights, and allows countries to set higher standards if they choose. It also allows countries to dispute intellectual property rights claims made by other countries. The TRIPs Agreement is periodically updated to reflect changes in technology and the global market for intellectual property.

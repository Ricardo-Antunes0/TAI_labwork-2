The Twin Mounds Site (15BA2 and 15BA14), located in eastern Iowa near the town of Manchester, consists of two mounds, each about 40 feet (12 m) high and 150 feet (46 m) wide at the base. The larger mound, 15BA2, is composed of a series of concentric ridges that rise to a height of more than 6 feet (2 m). The smaller mound, 15BA14, is composed of a series of low ridges.  The Twin Mounds Site was first noted by Europeans in the early 1800s and was first investigated in 1876. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1966. The site has been the subject of archaeological investigations since the early 1800s and remains one of the most intensively studied prehistoric sites in the United States. The mound complex and surrounding area have been designated a National Historic Landmark District.

Paint Drying is a 2016 British feature-length drama film written, directed and produced by Peter Kosminsky. It stars Emily Watson, Colin Firth, Ciar√°n Hinds and Steve Buscemi.   In the small town of Sandringham, England, retired schoolteacher Elspeth March (Watson) lives a solitary life with her dog, Rufus. One day, she receives a letter from her ex-husband (Firth), who is now living in Spain. Elspeth visits him and they reminisce about their past. Elspeth reveals that she used to be an artist and that she used to paint landscapes of Sandringham. Her husband tells her that he still has her paintings and wants her to send them to him. Elspeth is touched by this gesture and decides to start painting again.   One of Elspeth's former students, Jenny (Hinds), visits her and tells her that she's married with a young child. Elspeth invites Jenny to come stay with her in Sandringham while she paints. While Jenny is there, she helps Elspeth paint the landscapes that she had been unable to finish before.   One night, Elspeth is painting in her garden when she sees a man walking down the street. She gets a feeling that he's been watching her, so she goes inside to call Jenny. When Jenny arrives, she finds Elspeth lying on the floor bleeding from a head wound.

Khmer sastra is a sastra, or manuscript, written during and after the Khmer Empire, from at least the 12th century, in Southeast Asia. Khmer sastras are written in the pali language, and some in Khmer, on a variety of material, mostly dried palm leaves from the Corypha lecomtei palm tree, ordered and tied together in what is known as an olla book or palm-leaf manuscript. The tradition of producing olla books in Cambodia goes back as far as the influence of Indian civilization in the region and the tradition of Khmer sastras is at least contemporaneous with the introduction of Buddhism and other religions of Indian origin in the Khmer realm. Their presence in Cambodia is attested with certainty in a 12th-century bas-relief in the grandiose Angkor Wat temple, depicting an apsara (female spirit) holding an olla book. The Chinese visitor Zhou Daguan, who toured the Khmer capital in 1292, also relates in his travelogue that monks would recite daily prayers read from books made of "very evenly stacked palm leaves".

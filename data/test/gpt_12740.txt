The Grass River is a historically important tributary of the Red River in Manitoba, Canada.  The Grass River flows for from the Canadian Shield in the Municipality of Morris to its confluence with the Red River near the town of Morris, about downstream from the mouth of the Assiniboine River. The river is about long and has a drainage area of about .  The Grass River was first explored by fur traders in the mid-18th century. The name "Grass River" comes from the French word "gras", meaning "fat". In 1738, a party led by Pierre Gaultier de Varennes crossed the river on their way to rendezvous with a larger expedition under Jacques Cartier. The first settlement on the banks of the Grass River was Fort La Reine, built by a party of First Nations people in 1798. In 1806, fur trader Alexander McKay established Fort Gibraltar on the banks of the Grass River. British troops under the command of Colonel George Murray attacked and burnt Fort Gibraltar in 1814 during the War of 1812. The fort was rebuilt and served as a trading post until it was abandoned in 1892.  The first white settler on the banks of the Grass River was Christopher Simpson, who arrived there in 1827. Simpson built a trading post and settled down to live there permanently. In 1835, Simpson sold his property to John McCauley, who built a sawmill and a grist mill on the river. McCauley

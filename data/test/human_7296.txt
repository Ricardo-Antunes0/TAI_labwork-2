One of the core packages of the tidyverse in the R programming language, dplyr is primarily a set of functions designed to enable dataframe manipulation in an intuitive, user-friendly way.  Data analysts typically use dplyr in order to transform existing datasets into a format better suited for some particular type of analysis, or data visualization.       For instance, someone seeking to analyze an enormous dataset may wish to only view a smaller subset of the data.  Alternatively, a user may wish to rearrange the data in order to see the rows ranked by some numerical value, or even based on a combination of values from the original dataset.          Authored primarily by Hadley Wickham, dplyr was launched in 2014.  On the dplyr web page, the package is described as "a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges."

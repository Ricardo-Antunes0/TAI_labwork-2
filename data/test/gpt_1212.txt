R v Cheshire [1991] 1 WLR 844  In this case, the defendant was convicted of rape after engaging in sexual activity with a 13-year-old girl. The defendant appealed, claiming that the trial judge erred in refusing to allow him to call an expert witness who could have testified that the victim's alleged consent was not valid because she was too young at the time of the sexual activity. The defendant's appeal was unsuccessful.

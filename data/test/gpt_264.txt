{{Infobox college football bowl game | name  | region  | venue  | start time  | end time  | TV channel  | website  | sponsors  The Cheez-It Bowl is a college football bowl game that is part of the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The game is played annually at the Chick-fil-A Bowl in Atlanta, Georgia, and has been played since 2007. The game's official title sponsor is Cheez-It.  The game is one of the new bowls that began in 2006 with the merger of the Big Ten Conference and the Pacific-10 Conference. As such, it is one of six bowls that are part of a conference's "home" division. The other five bowls are the Rose Bowl Game, Fiesta Bowl, Orange Bowl, Cotton Bowl Classic, and Peach Bowl. The matchups for the four non-conference games are selected by a rotating committee that includes representatives from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), Big 12 Conference, Big Ten Conference, Pac-12 Conference, and SEC.   The Chick-fil-A Bowl was originally known as the Peach Bowl Game. However, due to Peaches' association with the Confederate flag, its name was changed before the game's first year.

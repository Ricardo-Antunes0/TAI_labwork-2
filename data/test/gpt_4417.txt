Sir Joseph Norman Lockyer  (17 May 1836 – 5 December 1912) was an English astronomer, physicist, and chemist who made significant contributions to our understanding of the solar system and its planets. He was also a noted popularizer of science, and helped to foster public interest in astronomy.  Born in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, Lockyer was the son of a surgeon. After studying at the Royal School of Mines and the University of Cambridge, Lockyer became a chemist in the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich. In 1862 he became head of chemistry at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, a post he held for 20 years. In 1879 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1883 he was appointed Director of the Royal Observatory Greenwich, a post he held for 27 years.  Lockyer's most famous work was his work on the solar system. In 1868 he published a paper entitled "On the nature of comets", which would eventually lead to his most famous discovery: that comets are composed of ice and dust. He also made significant contributions to our understanding of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. Lockyer also played an important role in promoting public interest in astronomy. He wrote numerous popular books on astronomy and science, and served as president of the British Astronomical Association (1887–1889).  Lockyer died in 1912 at the age of 78. He was buried in Norwood Cemetery in London.

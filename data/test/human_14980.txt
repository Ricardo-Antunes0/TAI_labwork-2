Safe Haven is the debut studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Ruth B. Released on May 5, 2017, when she was 21, the album garnered highly positive reviews and has been certified gold by Music Canada. Two of the songs from her debut extended play The Intro are included in the album. Those are "Lost Boy" and "Superficial Love", though the production for "Superficial Love" is different from that of the EP. The album was produced by Joel Little, Mike Elizondo and Ruth Berhe. Background In a 2017 interview, Ruth B. stated: "I have put the last couple years of my life into this album. My memories and stories  all make appearances in the melodies and hooks. My greatest hope is that these songs will resonate with listeners and find homes in their hearts". With producer Joel Little, she began recording the album in 2016 after the success of her debut EP. Little remarked that he became interested in working with Ruth B. after an acquaintance sent him some of her songs. "She had this phenomenal catalogue," he said, and compared her vocal style favorably with Lorde's. In addition to Joel Little, tracks on the album were produced by Mike Elizondo and Ruth Berhe.

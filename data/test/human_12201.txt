Horten Station  is a former railway station in Horten, Norway, which was the terminus of the Horten Line and in use between 1881 and 1967. The station was designed in Swiss chalet style by Balthazar Lange and was wedged between the town and the Oslofjord. It was located  from Oslo. When the Vestfold Line was being planned, some plans called for it to run via Horten. Instead, a more inland route was chosen and a  branch line was built to the town. Traffic peaked in the 1920s, when ca. 200,000 people traveled on the line, and the station saw a peak thirteen daily services during the 1940. The line past the station was converted to standard gauge in 1949 and electrified in 1957. By then the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) had started to run a bus service to Skoppum Station and gradually reduced service to Horten. From 1967 all passenger traffic was terminated. The station building has since burned down.

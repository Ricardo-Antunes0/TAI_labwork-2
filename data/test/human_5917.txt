Reload4j was created by the original author of log4j 1.x, Ceki Gülcü. Reload4j is a fork of log4j version 1.2.17. It preserves the same java package name space, in this case org.apache.log4j. However, for reasons of trademark protection, it is published under the "ch.qos.reload4j" groupId in Apache Maven Central. It can be thus considered as a drop-in replacement for log4j. The aim of the reload4j project is to provide an very easy migration path to those users wishing to correct log4j 1.x security issues. For many companies this is a requirement by the FTC. Upgrading to a newer version of log4j 1.x is not possible since the project has been declared EOL by the Apache Software Foundation. This decision was reaffirmed in 2022 and could not be rescinded despite the best efforts of several volunteers. Instead, the Log4j2 team incomprehensibly claims that deadlocks and other problems are impossible to fix. They further claim that the only safe way is to upgrade to log4j 2.x. Log4j 2.x has a considerably different API and configuration style. While some users see the benefit, the pertinence of reload4j and the necessity of a fork is subject of debate.

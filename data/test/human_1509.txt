Louisiana Highway 3127 (LA 3127)  is a state highway in Louisiana that serves Ascension, St. James, St. John the Baptist, and St. Charles Parishes.  It spans  in a northwest to southeast direction.  It parallels LA 18 along the west bank of the Mississippi River, providing a much shorter inland bypass of the River Road.  It is bannered in all four cardinal directions depending upon the part of the route. Route description Throughout its length, LA 3127 was built to eventually accommodate four lanes of traffic, as the land throughout its routing has been cleared for this accommodation.  From the northwest, LA 3127 begins at a junction with LA 70 east of Donaldsonville and immediately enters St. James Parish.  Undivided, two lanes, and largely secluded for the first several miles, it heads eastward and intersects LA 3219 near the community of St. James.  Near Vacherie, it intersects   LA 20.  Continuing eastward, the route crosses into St. John the Baptist Parish before a junction with LA 640 south of Edgard.  As LA 3127 crosses into St. Charles Parish, the highway turns toward the southeast.  Shortly afterward, it divides and expands to four lanes.  Access to the river communities of Killona, Taft, and Hahnville as well as many chemical and industrial facilities are provided via junctions with LA 3141, LA 3142, and LA 3160, respectively.

Content Examining American television's most popular stars and shows, including  Amos 'n' Andy,  Beulah, The Nat King Cole Show, Julia, The Jeffersons, Sanford and Son, Good Times, Roots, The Cosby Show, Frank's Place, and others, Riggs outlines a history of the race conflict as reflected in television.

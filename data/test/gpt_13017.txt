Bob and Margaret is an adult animated television series produced by Cartoon Network. The show is about two anthropomorphic bobcats, Bob and Margaret, who live in a suburban neighborhood and are married.  Bob and Margaret were originally conceived as a vehicle for the network's popular adult-oriented programming block Adult Swim. The show was conceived by network executives as a way to attract older viewers to the block, which was seen as struggling at the time. Development of the show was subsequently handed off to Cartoon Network Studios.  The series premiered on Cartoon Network on September 9, 2001. The first season consisted of 11 episodes. The second season, which aired from July 12 to September 8, 2002, consisted of 13 episodes. A third season of 26 episodes was released on October 25, 2002. A fourth season of 26 episodes was released on October 3, 2003. A fifth and final season of 26 episodes was released on October 9, 2004.  In March 2010, it was announced that Bob and Margaret would not be renewed for a sixth season.

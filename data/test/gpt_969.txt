The Yakovlev Yak-19 (Russian: Як-19, USAF/DOD designation: YF-19) is a Russian supersonic jet fighter designed and built by the Yakovlev Design Bureau. The aircraft entered service with the Russian Air Force in 1978.  The Yak-19 was a development of the Yak-15, which was itself a variant of the Yak-11 fighter. The primary difference between the Yak-15 and Yak-19 is that the former has a twin tail, while the latter has a single tail. The Yak-19 was originally designated as the "Yak-15M" before receiving its present designation.  The Yak-19 is a single-seat, all-weather jet fighter that uses a combination of conventional and afterburning turbojet engines for propulsion. It has an operational ceiling of 51,000 feet (15,000 m) and can reach speeds of Mach 1.85 (1,080 km/h or 546 mph). The aircraft can carry up to 2,000 pounds (910 kg) of weapons payload, including air-to-air missiles, bombs, and missiles targeting ground targets.

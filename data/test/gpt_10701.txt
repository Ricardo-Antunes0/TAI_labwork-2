Sevenstones Lightship is a lightvessel station off the coast of County Donegal, Ireland. It is operated by the Irish Coast Guard.  The Sevenstones Lightship was built in 1887 by the White Star Line as a replacement for their earlier lightship, the Mayflower. The Sevenstones was designed by Robert Stevenson, and was the first lightvessel with an electric light. The lightship served as a lighthouse and rescue vessel until it was decommissioned in 1930. The Sevenstones was donated to the Irish Coast Guard in 1948 and is now used as a navigation aid and training centre.

Tim Low (born 1956) is an Australian artist who works primarily in video and photography.  Low was born in 1956 in Melbourne, Australia. He studied at the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne, and received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1981. Low then moved to New York City, where he continued his studies at the School of Visual Arts. He has lived and worked in New York City since 1981.  Low's work often explores the relationship between humans and technology. His video works use everyday objects and footage to explore the way that our culture shapes our perceptions of reality. For example, his video "The World's Longest Time-Lapse" (2001) documents a day in the life of an office building over a period of five years. Low's photographs also often focus on the ways that technology influences our physical and mental health. For example, his series "Somatic Memory" (2002) documents people who have undergone surgery to remove tumors from their brains.  Low has exhibited his work throughout Europe, North America, and Asia. He has been the recipient of numerous awards, including the prestigious Golden Lion Award at the Venice Biennale in 2001, and the Australian Art Award in 2002. Low is currently a professor at Bard College in New York City

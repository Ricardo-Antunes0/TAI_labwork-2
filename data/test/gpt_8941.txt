Interproximal reduction (IPR) (also called interproximal enamel hypoplasia, interproximal enamel hypoplasia type I or enamel hypoplasia, congenital) is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by an altered development of the enamel on the teeth. IPR is caused by a mutation in the ENAMEP gene.  IPR is a disorder of tooth development that results in an abnormal formation of enamel on the teeth. The disorder is caused by a mutation in the ENAMEP gene, which is located on the short arm of chromosome 6. IPR is most commonly inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion, meaning that one copy of the mutation can cause the disorder. IPR occurs in approximately 1 in 5000 individuals, and it is most common in males.  IPR typically begins to develop during pregnancy as enamel begins to form on the teeth. However, IPR can also develop at any point in life. In most cases, IPR involves abnormalities in only one tooth â€“ typically the first tooth that develops. However, IPR can also affect multiple teeth simultaneously.  IPR is typically diagnosed using genetic testing. If the diagnosis is made early enough, treatment options include carrying out corrective dental procedures (such as interproximal reduction) before any permanent damage has occurred. If treatment is not available or if damage has already occurred, patients may experience difficulty eating certain foods and may experience increased sensitivity to hot and cold temperatures.

Trained immunity is a long-term functional modification of cells in the innate immune system (the one with which an organism is born) to create a "memory" of a pathogen with an altered response to a second challenge. Trained immunity creates no antibodies in preparation for a second encounter. This type of immunity is mediated mostly by epigenetic modifications, alterations in gene expression and cellular function without changes to the original DNA sequence. The resulting immunity lasts up to several months, in contrast to the classical immunological memory (which may last up to a lifetime), and is usually unspecific because there is no production of specific antibodies/receptors. As such, the trained immunity has also been suggested to possess a transgenerational effect. This effect was for example observed at lower mortality rate in children, vaccinated with Bacillus Calmetter-Guérin vaccine – the children of mothers, which underwent vaccination as well had a lower mortality rate than children of unvaccinated mothers. The term "trained immunity" is relatively new – immunological memory has previously been considered only as a part of adaptive immunity – and refers only to changes in innate immune memory of vertebrates.  The term "innate immune memory" is sometimes used as a synonym for the term trained immunity which was first coined by the Mihai Netea and his in 2011. In addition to its specific effect against tuberculosis, the trained immunity provided by the BCG vaccine might have beneficial nonspecific (off-target) effects on the immune system that protect against a wide range of other infections and that vaccination with BCG might have a role in protecting health-care workers and other vulnerable individuals against severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Innate immunity rendered by BCG vaccination is a non-specific protective response against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including, viruses, such as SARS-CoV-19, as well as bacteria (Francisella), parasites (Leishmania, Malaria), and other intracellular microbes. This protective response is shown to be nitric oxide mediated.

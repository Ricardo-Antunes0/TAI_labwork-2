Big Big Train are an English progressive rock band formed in 1967. The band's line-up has varied over the years, but has been consistently fronted by singer-guitarist Pete Gabriel, with occasional appearances by bassist Colin Edwin and drummer Simon Phillips.  The band's early music was rooted in the progressive rock movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, but they have since broadened their sound to encompass pop, folk and rock elements. They have released fourteen studio albums, as well as one live album and several compilation albums, and have sold over ten million records worldwide.  Big Big Train have been praised for their diverse and complex music, their singer-guitarist's strong vocal performance, and their ability to combine progressive rock with elements of other genres. They were awarded the Ivor Novello Award for Best Rock Band in 1992 and were nominated for the same award in 1993, 1997, 2001 and 2003.

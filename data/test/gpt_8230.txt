Weakest Link (also known as The Weakest Link, The $100,000 Pyramid, and The British Â£50,000 Pyramid) is an American television game show in which contestants compete to answer questions and win money by linking together three or more players, who are then eliminated one at a time.  The show began airing on ABC on September 14, 1984 and ended on May 20, 2002 after 14 seasons. It was revived on NBC on July 10, 2004 and ended on May 19, 2007 after six seasons. A Chinese version called The Chinese Weakest Link aired on CCTV-9 from 2005 to 2007.  The show was created by Sherwood Schwartz and produced by ABC Television Productions. The original host was Bob Eubanks, with John Davidson as the primary question-answerer.  Since its revival on NBC, a new host has been featured each season. In the first season (2004), the host was Drew Carey; in the second season (2005), it was Alex Trebek; in the third and fourth seasons (2006 and 2007), it was Michael Richards; in the fifth season (2008), it was Jeopardy! champion Ken Jennings; in the sixth and final season (2009), it was Drew Carey again; and in the seventh season (2010), it was Mario Lopez. In the eighth season (2011), it reverted to Drew Carey for one episode as part of a stunt; since then, it has been hosted by Brad Garrett.

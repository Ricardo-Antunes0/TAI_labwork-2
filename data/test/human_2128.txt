Later in 2005, it  publicly floated the business as SP Ausnet, and selling 49% of the remaining assets for about $1 billion to the public, while retaining a 51% stake. In 2007 it joined with Babcock & Brown for the $7.4 billion Alinta acquisition, and during the global financial crisis that year, it tried but failed to sell the Alinta assets into SP Ausnet.

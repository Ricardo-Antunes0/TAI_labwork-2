MyoD, also known as myoblast determination protein, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MYO5A gene. MyoD is a glycoprotein and a member of the myogenin family.  MyoD is expressed primarily in skeletal muscle, where it plays a role in the initiation and progression of muscle growth. MyoD has also been linked to Duchenne muscular dystrophy and may be a potential therapeutic target for this disease.

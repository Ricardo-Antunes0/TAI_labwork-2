Carlbrook School was a private, coeducational, college preparatory boarding school located on  in Halifax, Virginia. It was non-sectarian and covered grades 9 through 12. As of 2014, it reported enrollment of 80 students. The school closed permanently in December 2015. At that time, it had graduated almost 700 alumni. Carlbrook's mission statement was to help students discover, internalize and effectively utilize the intellectual and personal resources necessary to succeed in college and in life. History Carlbrook was founded in early 2002 by Cascade School graduates Robert "Grant" Price, Jr. and Justin J. Merritt. Within the first week of their opening, there were seven students enrolled. By June 2003, it had grown to 89 students. All new students were required to complete a wilderness therapy program before enrolling. In 2003, a school official explained that wilderness programs help prepare students for success in the school program and function as a "filter," meaning that students who successfully complete these programs are more likely to succeed at Carlbrook. Grant hired several former CEDU staff to implement a similar emotional growth program.

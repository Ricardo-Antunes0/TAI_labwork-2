Big Apple Comix is an early independent comic book company that was active from the late 1960s to the early 1980s.  Big Apple Comix was founded in 1966 by artists and writers including Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and Jerry Robinson. The company's first title, "The Big Apple", was published in 1967 and featured stories by Kirby, Ditko, and Robinson.  Big Apple Comix ceased operations in the early 1980s, but its legacy continued through the release of its titles in reprint form. In 2006, DC Comics released a collected edition of "The Big Apple" under the title "The Complete Big Apple Comics".

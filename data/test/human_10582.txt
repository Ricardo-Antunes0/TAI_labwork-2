The saw sam sai (, , , also spelled saw samsai, and occasionally called simply sam sai; literally 'three-stringed fiddle') is a traditional bowed string instrument of Thailand. It is in the saw family of Thai fiddles, which also includes the saw u and saw duang, but unlike the other two, has three strings, with a bow that is separate from the instrument. The saw sam sai is made up of three parts: the neck, the bout, and the bow. It has a three-lobed coconut bowl for a body, and a hardwood or ivory neck that has been cleaned and polished with wood varnish. The coconut bowl is covered on one end with animal skin, and it has three silk strings. Its bow is constructed of horsetail and hardwood. Other the elements include the pegs, nut, bridge, gem, lasso, and strings. Typically, the player glues a jewel onto the skin before playing, to reduce the skin's resonance. The instrument is regarded as one of high stature, and is often ornately decorated. It is believed to have been used since the Sukhothai period, and is related to a very similar Cambodian instrument called tro Khmer.

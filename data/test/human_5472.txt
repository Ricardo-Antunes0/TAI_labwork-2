Janet (Jan) Corinne Brown (born June 23, 1947 in Nanaimo, British Columbia) is a Canadian former politician.  She was first elected as a Member of Parliament under the Reform Party of Canada ticket in the Alberta riding of Calgary Southeast in the 1993 federal election.  Before entering politics, Brown was a schoolteacher and then agribusiness executive. She is of Croatian descent. Brown rose to prominence as a well-spoken and moderate member of the Reform Party, becoming Canadian Heritage Critic in its shadow cabinet when it was second Opposition in the 35th Canadian Parliament. She and Stephen Harper were the only two MPs to speak out against the motion to deny same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual ones at the 1994 Reform convention. She won much admiration for putting a yellow rose on the empty desk of rival Bloc Québécois party leader Lucien Bouchard, who was suffering from a life-threatening illness. The image of the solitary rose on his empty desk was broadcast around the nation. Brown was curious about gender roles within Canadian politics and subsequently wrote an article on the subject.

PC/104 (or PC104) is a family of small computer systems designed by Intel and first shipped in 1994.  PC/104 was designed as an embedded system platform, initially for use in point-of-sale (POS) systems and other embedded applications. The original PC/104 specification supported a maximum of 64 devices on a single bus, but later revisions doubled the bus width to 128 devices.  In 1998, Intel introduced the first PC/104-based server platform, the Xeon PC Server 1000 series. This platform targeted the small business and midrange enterprise markets. In 2002, Intel released the first PC/104-based workstation platform, the Pentium 4 PC Server G1120. This platform was aimed at the mid-market desktop market.   Intel has since ceased development of new PC/104 products, but continues to support existing platforms with software updates and support services.

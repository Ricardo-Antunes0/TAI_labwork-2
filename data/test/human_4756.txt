Bioorganometallic chemistry is the study of biologically active molecules that contain carbon directly bonded to metals or metalloids. The importance of main-group and transition-metal centers has long been recognized as important to the function of enzymes and other biomolecules.  However, only a small subset of naturally-occurring metal complexes and synthetically prepared pharmaceuticals are organometallic; that is, they feature a direct covalent bond between the metal(loid) and a carbon atom.  The first, and for a long time, the only examples of naturally occurring bioorganometallic compounds were the cobalamin cofactors (vitamin B12) in its various forms.  Due to the recent (21st century) discovery of new systems containing carbon-metal bonds in biology, bioorganometallic chemistry is rapidly emerging as a distinct subdiscipline of bioinorganic chemistry that straddles organometallic chemistry and biochemistry.  Naturally occurring bioorganometallics include enzymes and sensor proteins.  Also within this realm are synthetically prepared organometallic compounds that serve as new drugs and imaging agents (technetium-99m sestamibi) as well as the principles relevant to the toxicology of organometallic compounds (e.g., methylmercury).  Consequently, bioorganometallic chemistry is increasingly relevant to medicine and pharmacology. In cofactors and prosthetic groups  Vitamin B12 is the preeminent bioorganometallic species.  Vitamin B12 is actually a collection of related enzyme cofactors, several of which contain cobaltâ€“alkyl bonds, and is involved in biological methylation and 1,2-carbon rearrangement reactions.  For a long time since its structure was elucidated by Hodgkin in 1955, it was believed to be the only example of a naturally occurring bioorganometallic system.

Yukthivadi  (The Rationalist) was the first  rationalist/atheist journal published in Malayalam.  The contribution made by Yukthivadi to the renaissance of Kerala, India is significant. The launch of Yukthivadi marks the beginning of organised rationalism in Kerala, which is a key constituent of the Reformation Movement in the state. History and profile Yukthivadi started its publication in August 1929 from Ernakulam under the editorial board of M. Ramavarma Thampan, C. Krishnan, C. V. Kunhiraman, Sahodaran Ayyappan and M.C. Joseph. In a statement published in the first issue of Yukthivadi, Sahodaran K. Ayyappan wrote: Rationalism is not a religion. It is an attitude to accept knowledge based upon reason.   Yukthivadi will attempt to generate such an attitude amongst the people.  To do this, we will have to criticize irrational faiths and propagate rational knowledge.  Since Yukthivadi does not believe in any ultimate knowledge, it will not hesitate to correct itself based upon the latest information and knowledge.  Every rationalist is bound to do so.  The only maxim that Yukthivadi accepts as unchangeable is that the knowledge should be based upon reason.

Star-Child is a piece written in 1977 for orchestra and voices by the American composer George Crumb.  Harold C. Schonberg of The New York Times said of the work, "Star-Child…is sensitive, powerful, full of personality, and it marks a significant step in Mr. Crumb's development…. This is big music and even passionate music. In a way, it is a synthesis both of what Mr. Crumb has been doing and of many contemporary techniques. Mr. Crumb has tied everything together, creating a score that transcends any derivations." Composition and premiere Star-Child was commissioned by the Ford Foundation and written in 1977. It is Crumb's largest work and requires 47 instrumentalists as well as many vocalists. It calls for soprano, antiphonal children's voices, male speaking choir, bell ringers, and large orchestra. Originally, the orchestra members spoke as well as played, and the children’s choir also played the handbells, but this was later revised in 1979 to the current personnel list. The current personnel lists calls for 4 flutes (also playing 4 piccolos), 4 oboes (1 doubling on English horn), 3 clarinets in Bb, 1 clarinet in Eb, 3 bassoons, 1 contrabassoon, 6 french horns, 5 trumpets in C, 2 trumpets in D, 3 trombones, 1 tuba, 8 percussionists, 1 organ, 1 solo soprano, children's voices I and II (SASA), male speaking choir playing handbells, violins I, violins II, violas, cellos, and contrabasses. 2 primary conductors and 2 secondary conductors are also needed.

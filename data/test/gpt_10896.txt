It has an installed capacity of 4.5 megawatts (MW), and it was commissioned in 2010. The scheme is owned and operated by the Irish Power Authority.  The Rubicon Hydroelectric Scheme was conceived in 2006 as a way to help offset the impact of the global economic recession on the Irish Power Authority's (IPA) electricity generation portfolio. The scheme was developed by a private company, Rubicon Hydroenergy, and it was constructed by civil engineering contractor Kier. The scheme cost €2.9 million to install and €1.5 million to operate annually.  The Rubicon Hydroelectric Scheme is located on the River Rubicon, which is a tributary of the River Shannon. The reservoir formed by the scheme can hold up to 180 million litres of water, and it provides power to approximately 1,000 homes in County Kerry.

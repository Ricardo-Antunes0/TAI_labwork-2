Ruby chocolate is a variety of chocolate introduced in 2017 by Barry Callebaut, a Belgianâ€“Swiss cocoa company. In development since 2004, it was patented in 2015 by inventors Dumarche et al. and assigned to Barry Callebaut under patent number US 9107430, 2015. It was unveiled at a private event in Shanghai on 5 September 2017. It is marketed as the fourth type of chocolate alongside dark, milk, and white chocolate varieties and has a pink colour. Overview The chocolate is characterized by a taste that has been described as slightly sweet and sour, which is comparable to that of berries, as the chocolate's main characteristic is its acidity. In a comparison of the phenolic content between varieties of chocolate, ruby chocolate was rated between milk and white chocolate. According to standards set by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States ruby chocolate must contain a minimum of 1.5% nonfat cacao solids and a minimum of 20% by weight of cacao fat. It may contain antioxidants, spices, and other natural and artificial flavorings; however, these ingredients cannot mimic the flavours of chocolate, milk, butter, or a fruit, and it cannot contain additional colouring.

John C. "Jay" Cocks, Jr. (born January 3, 1953) is an American musician and songwriter. He is the founder and lead guitarist of the hardcore punk band The Dead Kennedys.  Cocks was born in Los Angeles, California. He played in a number of hardcore punk bands before starting The Dead Kennedys with drummer Jello Biafra in 1978. Cocks wrote songs that were critical of American society and its government, and the band's aggressive music and political lyrics soon made them one of the most controversial and influential rock bands of the 1980s. The Dead Kennedys released eleven albums between 1978 and 1995, including their platinum-selling album Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1987). In 2004, Cocks released an autobiography, Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death: A Life in Punk Rock.  Cocks has been married three times: to Kathleen Madigan from 1978 to 1981; to Lori Goldston from 1985 to 1992; and to Jennifer Finch from 1993 to 2007. He has two children, John and Molly.

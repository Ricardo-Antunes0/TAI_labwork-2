Prasophyllum anticum, commonly known as the Pretty Hill leek orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to Victoria. It has a single tubular, dark green leaf and between ten and twenty five scented, greenish-brown flowers and is only known from a small area in the south-west of the state. Description Prasophyllum anticum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf up to  long and  wide at the base. Between ten and twenty five scented, greenish-brown flowers are crowded along a flowering spike about  long. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped to lance-shaped and about the same size as the lateral sepals which are erect and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are oblong to lance-shaped and about  long. The labellum is egg-shaped,  long, turns upwards at about 90Â° and has slightly wavy edges. Flowering occurs from October to November.

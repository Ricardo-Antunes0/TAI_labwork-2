Building 98 at Fort D. A. Russell in the Presidio of San Francisco, California is a nine-story artillery observation tower and fortification. It was built between 1898 and 1900, and was used by the United States Army until 1957. The tower is now a tourist attraction with an observation deck open to the public.  The fortifications at Fort D. A. Russell were designed by Major General James H. Carleton, who also supervised construction of the forts at Point Defiance (1892-1894), Fort McPherson (1895-1897), and Fort Sheridan (1899-1900). Construction on Building 98 began in 1898 and was completed in 1900. The tower was built to provide artillery observers with a clear view of enemy movements on the San Francisco Bay Area, and to serve as a lookout for possible naval attacks on the city.  In 1957, the Army ceased using Building 98 as an artillery observation tower and fortification. Since then, it has been used occasionally for military ceremonies and as a tourist attraction. Today, the tower is open to the public for tours that include access to the observation deck.

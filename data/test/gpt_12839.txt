Intensive agriculture, also known as intensive farming, intensive gardening, or high-density farming, is a production farming system that relies on a high density of crops per unit of land. The main characteristic of this system is the use of inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides and water in high concentrations, which enhances crop yields. The practice has become more popular in the past several decades as it has been shown to be more efficient than traditional agriculture.  Intensive agriculture has several benefits over traditional agriculture. First, intensive farming systems are more productive. In general, a hectare of land can produce 2.5 times as much food using intensive methods as compared to traditional methods. This increased output allows for farmers to produce more food with the same amount of land, which reduces the need for land expansion or deforestation. Furthermore, intensive farming systems are less damaging to the environment. Compared to traditional agriculture, intensive farming systems use less water and fertilizer, reducing the amount of pollutants that are released into the environment. Additionally, intensive farming systems allow for more diverse crop production, which helps to maintain biodiversity.  Despite these benefits, there are some drawbacks to intensive agriculture systems. First, intensive farming can be more expensive than traditional agriculture. This is because intensive systems require higher levels of inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides. Second, intensive farming systems can lead to higher levels of pollution in the environment. This is because intensified systems use more water and fertilizer than traditional agriculture, which increases the amount of pollutants that are released into the environment. Finally, intensive

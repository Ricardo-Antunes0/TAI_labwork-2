A cyphonautes is a larva of an ectoproct or bryozoan. It is triangular in profile with a heavily-ciliated band called the corona at the base of the triangle and a sense organ at the apex (cypho-, bent; nautes, sailor).  The beating of coronal cilia propels the cyphonautes through the water and contributes to a feeding current.  The cyphonautes is very thin, i.e. laterally compressed, and is bounded laterally by two valves or shell plates.  The internal anatomy of the archetypical cyphonautes, such as the one featured in the life cycles of Membranipora, includes a complete digestive tract with a stomach entrance near the apex and a hindgut ending in an anus near one end of the base.  At the other end of the triangle's base is the pyriform organ, a heavily ciliated and glandular complex that functions in site selection at settlement.   Much of the internal space in the cyphonautes is devoted to a funnel that, in Membranipora's long-lived feeding cyphonautes, is divided by a pair of ciliated ridges into inhalant and exhalant chambers.  The ciliated ridges drive a water current that circulates through the funnel.  Ridge cilia undergo transient reversals as prey items are detected in the passing stream.  Another set of ridge cilia are stationary and create a sieve across the narrow slit between the paired ridges.  A third set of ridge cilia create a current toward the stomach entrance, assisted by cilia along the funnel walls.  These combined actions collect unicellular algae and other particles from the plankton.  Muscles connected to the valves can quickly narrow the slender aperture at the base of the triangle, expelling most of the fluid volume in a sort of a sneeze that can flush undesirable material that enters the funnel.  Combined with the action of long muscle fibers connected to the apical organ and corona, the entire body can transiently collapse between the valves.

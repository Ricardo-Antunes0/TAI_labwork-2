Demetrius (; died August 1277) was a Hungarian clergyman in the 13th century, a loyal supporter of King Béla IV of Hungary. Béla's envoy Demetrius was archdeacon of Bars. When King Béla's relationship with his oldest son and heir, Stephen, became tense in the early 1260s, he supported the elderly monarch. Timothy was appointed as Bishop of Zagreb by Pope Urban IV in September 1263. Béla IV protested against the pope's decision and sent a royal delegation led by his loyal clergyman Demetrius to Rome in October 1265 to attempt to invalidate Timothy's confirmation. There, Demetrius expressed Timothy's incompetence before the Roman Curia, arguing with his lowborn social status. Pope Clement IV was outraged by the archdeacon's claim and disrespectful tone and refused his request. Béla sent his envoy Demetrius in April 1266, but Pope Clement did not change his decision. To indicate his goodwill, he appointed Demetrius as papal chaplain. Following that Béla IV abandoned the case and acknowledged Timothy's election.

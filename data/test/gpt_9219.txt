The anthropause was a global reduction in human populations following the end of the Pleistocene epoch. This event was first proposed by the paleontologist Dr. Alan F. Wilson in his book The Mysterious Universe in 1982. The anthropause is estimated to have occurred between 12,000 and 18,000 years ago, but there is not yet a consensus on the precise time frame.  The anthropause is a term used to describe a global reduction in human populations following the end of the Pleistocene epoch, which began around 12,000 years ago. It was first proposed by the paleontologist Dr. Alan F. Wilson in his book The Mysterious Universe in 1982 and is estimated to have occurred between 12,000 and 18,000 years ago. However, there is not yet a consensus on the precise time frame.  The cause of the anthropause is unknown, but it is thought to have been caused by various factors including climate change, population growth, and disease. The anthropause has had a significant impact on human history and culture, and has had a significant impact on the development of modern civilization.

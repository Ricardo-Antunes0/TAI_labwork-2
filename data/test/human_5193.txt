The Vantuna was a marine research vessel that operated in the Southern California Bight, from 1969 until 2007. It served as a tool for coastal research and was a unique platform for Occidental College students to gain first-hand experience conducting marine research operations.  Scores of students who have worked on the Vantuna have gone on to have careers in marine science. History The vessel was built in 1961 by Ditmar-Donaldson in Costa Mesa as a personal fishing boat for Gilbert C. Van Camp III, the CEO of the Van Camp Seafood Company and makers of "Chicken of the Sea" tuna.  As a fishing boat, the Vantuna was configured for albacore fishing.  The vessel held two large,  live bait tanks and a 15-ton refrigerated fish hold. Metal racks attached to the stern provided platforms for fishermen close to the water's surface. They used long fishing poles with stainless steel leaders and barbless hooks. When large schools of albacore were located, live bait thrown into the water caused the fish to go into a feeding frenzy where they would bite anything, including the barbless hooks of the fishing poles.  Fish that were hooked were quickly pulled on board by the fisherman.  The barbless hooks would easily fall out of the fish's mouth, and then the fish was moved into the refrigerated hold.  Although this was his personal fishing boat, Mr. Van Camp took the fish he caught to the factory, where they were used by his company.

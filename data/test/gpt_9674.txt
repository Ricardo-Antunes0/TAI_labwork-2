Landscape archaeology, a sub-discipline of archaeology and historic preservation, is the study of the archaeological record within landscapes. It encompasses the examination of both natural and man-made features within the environment, in order to understand how they have been used and impacted by humans over time.  Landscape archaeology has a long history, dating back to pre-historic times. The first known practitioners of landscape archaeology were prehistoric hunter-gatherers, who used the landscape to identify prey and track game. Over time, humans have altered the landscape in a variety of ways, from building settlements and roads to planting crops and erecting monuments. By understanding how these various activities have affected the archaeological record, practitioners of landscape archaeology can gain a better understanding of human history.  Today, landscape archaeologists work throughout the world, investigating sites ranging from ancient villages to modern-day factories. Their findings can help us better understand human history and culture, as well as provide insights into current environmental practices.

The Oxford Placement Test (OPT) is an on demand computer-adaptive test of the English language for non-native speakers of English, reporting at Pre-A1, A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2 levels of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). The test was developed by Oxford University Press (OUP) to provide institutions with a quick, reliable way to place English language students into the correct level English class. Placement testing is a key stage in the learning cycle. History The Oxford Placement Test, the first globally available online computer-adaptive placement test, was launched in 2009 and has placed millions of test takers since it was launched. It tests British English, American English, or a mix of the two language variants. The OPT replaced the now retired Quick Placement Test, a CD-ROM test provided in partnership with Cambridge English. The success of the Oxford Placement Test led to the design of the Oxford Test of English, and online computer-adaptive English Proficiency test, used as proof of English ability for university entry and employment.

The Charter of Povlja  is a legal document written on 1 December 1250 in Povlja on the island of Bra훾, Croatia. It is parchment copy of an ownership document from the cartulary of the Benedictine monastery of St John the Baptist. It is one of the oldest Croatian cultural and linguistic records, which through its content provides a number of interesting insights into the various aspects of the time in which it was made. The first modern edition was published in 1881 by Franjo Ra훾ki in his book Starine (Antiquities). It is written in Cyrillic script by Ivan, the canon of the Cathedral Church of Split and a Hvar notary, at the request of the Povlja abbot Ivan, and by order of the Bishop of Hvar Nikola. The template for the first part of the charter was Prince Bre훾ko's charter from 1184, which regulated territorial relations between the estate of the monastery and the island's prince and 탑upan. That template charter is almost entirely included within the Charter of Povlja.

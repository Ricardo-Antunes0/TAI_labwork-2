A , often abbreviated as VN, is a video game genre that blends interactive storytelling with visual graphics.  Visual novels are a subgenre of video games that focus on story and characterization over action. Players control characters in a story, often with minimal interaction with the environment. Visual novels often use anime-style cutscenes and full-motion video (FMV) to advance the story.  The visual novel genre began in the early 1990s as an attempt to create more interesting and emotionally powerful stories than traditional video games could offer. The earliest examples were simple text adventures, but visual novels took off in the mid-2000s with titles such as "Karen Senki" and "Fate/stay night". Today, there are dozens of well-known visual novel titles available on various platforms, including PC, mobile devices, and consoles.

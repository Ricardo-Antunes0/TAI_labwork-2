“Lateral periodontal cysts (LPCs) are defined as fluid-filled sacs that form on the buccal and/or lingual surfaces of the maxilla or mandible. They are most commonly found in adults, but can also occur in children. They are thought to arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.”  Lateral periodontal cysts are sacs that form on the buccal and/or lingual surfaces of the maxilla or mandible. They are most commonly found in adults, but can also occur in children. They are thought to arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.  LPCs can be benign or malignant. Benign LPCs are typically filled with saliva and do not cause any symptoms. Malignant LPCs can grow and spread, leading to pain and tooth loss.  LPCs are treated with surgery if they become symptomatic or if they cause tooth loss.

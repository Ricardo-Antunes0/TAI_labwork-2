Liu Chieh (; 27 May 1907 â€“ 17 October 1993) was a Chinese mathematician and physicist who made significant contributions to the theory of partial differential equations and chaos theory.  Liu was born in 1907 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. After completing his undergraduate studies at the University of Wuhan, Liu went to the United States to continue his education at Yale University. In 1930 he received his doctorate from Yale and returned to China to teach at Peking University. He became a full professor at Peking University in 1944.  Liu's work on partial differential equations and chaos theory has had a significant impact on mathematics, physics, and engineering. He is also known for his work on the theory of flows and wavelets. Liu died in 1993 in Beijing, China.

Student Youth Network Inc., operating as SYN Media, is a nonprofit organization that provides opportunities for students in the Greater Toronto Area to develop their creativity and leadership skills.  SYN Media was founded in 1995 by a group of friends who recognized the need for a youth network in the Greater Toronto Area that would provide opportunities for students to develop their creativity and leadership skills. Today, SYN Media operates out of two locations in the GTA – the West End Cultural Centre in Toronto and the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre – and offers programs that range from arts and culture to environmental sustainability.   Through its programs and services, SYN Media strives to create a positive environment for students to explore their passions and talents. In addition to its facilities and programming, SYN Media relies on the support of its members and volunteers to continue providing quality programming and services to youth in the GTA.

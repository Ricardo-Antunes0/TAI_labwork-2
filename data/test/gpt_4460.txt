The PeregrineFund (named after the bird of prey) is a conservation organization founded in 1972 by John F. Kennedy, Jr. and his then wife, Jacqueline Bouvier. The organization's stated goal is "to conserving the Peregrine Falcon and its habitat for the benefit of humanity and nature."  The Peregrine Fund has successfully lured back Peregrines from the brink of extinction, and has been credited with helping to halt the decline of this bird of prey in North America. The organization also sponsors research into Peregrine biology and conservation.  In 1992, the Peregrine Fund opened its first European office in Barcelona, Spain. Today, the Peregrine Fund has offices in Amsterdam, Belgium; Paris, France; Vienna, Austria; Milan, Italy; Madrid, Spain; London, United Kingdom; Hamburg, Germany; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Istanbul, Turkey.

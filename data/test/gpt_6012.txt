Genoplesium filiforme, commonly known as the glandular fern or delicate fern, is a species of fern in the family Ophioglossaceae. It is endemic to California, where it grows in the chaparral and woodlands of the Central Valley.  This species is unusual for its small size (only 3â€“5 inches tall), delicate look, and glandular fronds. The fronds are flat, with a few short, stout stalks and a wide, thinblade. The underside of the blade is dark green, while the top is light green or yellow. The fronds are finely textured and have a slightly fuzzy texture.  The species is endangered due to habitat loss and degradation.

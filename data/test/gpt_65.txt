Greenwich ( ,  ,  , ) is a district of London, England, located in the London Borough of Greenwich. It forms part of the historical county of Kent. The town lies on the River Thames and at the edge of the Greenwich Peninsula.  The town has been known as Greenwich since 1086, when the Normans built a castle there. It was originally a small fishing village, but gradually grew into a wealthy maritime centre and rapidly became one of the most important ports in England. The arrival of the railway in 1839 led to rapid growth, and by 1901 Greenwich had a population of over 100,000. In 1971 it was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Today, Greenwich is still an important port and commercial centre, with many large employers and businesses based in the town. It is also home to some world-famous museums, including the National Maritime Museum, the Victoria & Albert Museum, and the British Museum.

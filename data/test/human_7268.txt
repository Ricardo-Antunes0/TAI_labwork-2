The Virginia Beach Neptunes were a proposed American professional baseball team based in Virginia Beach, Virginia. They were planned to be a member of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball. They would have been the second professional baseball club in the Hampton Roads region after the Norfolk Tides of the International League (AAA). Virginia Beach Professional Baseball, LLC, was awarded an Atlantic League franchise in April 2013 "after more than three years of effort".  In February 2014 the city council approved the team's ballpark proposal with completion expected by April 2015.  It was announced in April  2015 that the Neptunes would play their home games at Wheeler Field beginning in the 2016 season, but it was later reported that the stadium would open in 2017. A May 2016 report suggested that the team would not be ready even for the 2017 season. A July 2017 reply from the team's Facebook account said, "We are still working diligently to make this happen." (That reply was later deleted, as was their Facebook account.)

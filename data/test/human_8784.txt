Barry James Harper (30 October 1938 – 28 April 2003) was an Australian sportsman who played both Australian rules football and cricket at high levels. He played first-class cricket for Tasmania, and played and coached in the Northern Tasmanian Football Association (NTFA). Born in Launceston, Harper attended Launceston Technical High School (now Queechy High School), excelling at athletics. His football was played for City-South in the NTFA, and he later served as coach of Old Scotch, winning two premierships with the club. A right-handed opening batsman, Harper made his first-class debut for Tasmania during the 1961–62 season, having been a regular participant in the annual North v. South fixture played between NTCA and TCA representative sides. On debut against Victoria in February 1962, he opened with Glen Waters, but was dismissed cheaply in each innings – leg before wicket to Ron Gaunt for one run in the first innings, and run out for five by Alan Connolly and Ray Jordon in the second. He scored 11 and 0 in the next match against South Australia at Adelaide Oval, but in the final game of the season against Victoria at Kardinia Park, Geelong, recorded his only first-class half-century. His innings of 58 runs was made in 230 minutes, and included only two fours.

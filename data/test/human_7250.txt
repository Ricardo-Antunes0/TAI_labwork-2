In the mathematical field of differential geometry, one definition of a metric tensor is a type of function which takes as input a pair of tangent vectors  and  at a point of a surface (or higher dimensional differentiable manifold) and produces a real number scalar  in a way that generalizes many of the familiar properties of the dot product of vectors in Euclidean space.  In the same way as a dot product, metric tensors are used to define the length of and angle between tangent vectors.  Through integration, the metric tensor allows one to define and compute the length of curves on the manifold. A metric tensor is called positive-definite if it assigns a positive value  to every nonzero vector .  A manifold equipped with a positive-definite metric tensor is known as a Riemannian manifold.  On a Riemannian manifold, the curve connecting two points that (locally) has the smallest length is called a geodesic, and its length is the distance that a passenger in the manifold needs to traverse to go from one point to the other.  Equipped with this notion of length, a Riemannian manifold is a metric space, meaning that it has a distance function  whose value at a pair of points  and  is the distance from  to .  Conversely, the metric tensor itself is the derivative of the distance function (taken in a suitable manner).  Thus the metric tensor gives the infinitesimal distance on the manifold.

Scottish Forestry  is the public body responsible for the sustainable management of the country's forests. The organisation has its head office in Edinburgh and is a member of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Scottish Forestry is also a member of the UK Forest Service.  The forests of Scotland contain some of the most ancient and diverse trees in Europe. The country has an extensive area of temperate and boreal forest, as well as deciduous and coniferous woodland. Scots pine is the most common tree in Scottish forests, accounting for around 60% of all trees. Other species commonly found in Scottish forests include oak, ash, birch, juniper, larch and Douglas fir.   The management of Scottish forestry is focused on promoting sustainable forest management practices. These aim to ensure that the forest continues to provide benefits for people and nature long into the future. Key objectives include maintaining biodiversity, protecting water resources, reducing emissions, improving soil quality and contributing to climate change mitigation.    Scottish forestry plays an important role in protecting Scotland's environment and heritage. It contributes significantly to the economy by generating jobs and providing materials and services used by business and society.

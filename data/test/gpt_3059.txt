Stuckism is a contemporary art movement that began in Australia in the early 2000s. It is a reaction to the consumerism and over-production of the contemporary art world. Stuckists aim to create work that is "uncommercial, unglamorous, and unpretentious." This philosophy has led to the creation of artwork that is often simple, honest, and understated.  The Stuckist art movement began in Melbourne in 2001 with the exhibition "Stuckism: The Exhibition of Australasian Non-Objective Painting". Since then, there have been numerous exhibitions and projects throughout Australia, as well as overseas. The movement has been criticized for its lack of direction, but it has also been praised for its unique approach to art.

ImmTACs (Immune mobilising monoclonal T-cell receptors Against Cancer) are a class of T-cell receptors that bind to cancer antigens. They were first identified in patients with advanced cancer and have been shown to be effective against various types of cancer.  ImmTACs are currently being developed as a treatment for various types of cancer. They are being studied in trials for the treatment of breast, pancreatic, lung, and ovarian cancer. The first clinical trials using ImmTACs to treat cancer are expected to start in 2019.

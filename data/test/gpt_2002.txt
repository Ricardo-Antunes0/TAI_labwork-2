The Microsoft Puzzlehunt is a quasi-annual Microsoft online contest in which contestants are challenged to solve puzzles drawn from various Microsoft products. The puzzles can be found on Microsoft's website and can be solved by using common logic and reasoning skills.  The first puzzlehunt was held in 2007 and has since been released annually, with the exception of 2013, when it was replaced by the Microsoft Imagine Cup. As of 2019, there are currently eight puzzles in the puzzlehunt.  The objective of the puzzlehunt is to promote creativity and problem-solving skills among Microsoft users. The contest has been particularly successful in South Korea, where it is known as the Microsoft Brain Games.

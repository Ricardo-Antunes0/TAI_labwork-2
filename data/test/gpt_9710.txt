Reflex is a BBC television game show that premiered on 3 September 2007 and ended on 18 December 2009. Hosted by Noel Edmonds, it was produced by Avalon Television and aired on BBC One.  Reflex was conceived as a successor to the popular American game show "Pictionary" and was described as "a fast-paced and entertaining quiz show" with a "unique" format which involved contestants making rapid-fire guesses about words in a rotating panel of 24. The show had a relatively short run, lasting only three seasons and 33 episodes.   Despite its short run, the show has been well-received by television critics. It has been noted for its fast pace, humorous banter between the contestants, and various visual gags (including Noel Edmonds himself appearing in various sketches).

Palaeeudyptes antarcticus, also referred to as the Antarctic pygmy owl or the Antarctic snow owl, is a small owl found on the Antarctic Peninsula. They are not as well known as other owls in the region, partly because they are shy and difficult to spot.   The Antarctic pygmy owl is a small owl, measuring only 20 cm in length with a wingspan of about 35 cm. They have a paler hue than other owls in the region, and their facial features are also more delicate. This makes them difficult to spot, as they are mainly nocturnal and predominantly stay hidden in dense vegetation or snowfields. They feed mainly on small rodents and birds, but have been known to take down larger prey such as hares or rabbits.

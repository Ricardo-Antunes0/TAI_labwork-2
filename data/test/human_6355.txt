After Sweden lost the Great Northern War of the Baltic States, Witte moved to Sweden in 1710. In February 1710, Witte appealed to the National Council for a post in Sweden and the Council initially decided to appoint him to the vacant bishopric of Växjö. However, the decision to appoint the German-born Witte, who had insufficient knowledge of Swedish, raised strong oppositions and the Council withdrew its decision. Nonetheless, Witte managed to become the German-speaking chaplain of Ulrika Eleonora.

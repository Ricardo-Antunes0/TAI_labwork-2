He toured the United States extensively. Biography He studied law, history, natural science, and art at Halle, Munich, Freiburg, and Berlin, and traveled extensively in Europe, Canada, and the United States 1846-1847. The end of his travels in the United States found him in Cincinnati where he remained for seven months. Here he held some public presentations on "the significance of the German people in world history." Later he gathered these presentations together and published them as Geschichte und Zustände der Deutschen in Amerika (History and condition of the Germans in America; Cincinnati, 1848). As it was the first time such a book had appeared in Ohio, it made its author very popular; one passage in the book is also a likely source of the Muhlenberg legend that German almost became the official language of the United States.  He left for home 2 October 1847.

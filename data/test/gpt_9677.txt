Theodoros Papadimitriou (Greek: Θεόδωρος Παπαδημητρίου; 1931 – 11 October 2007) was a Greek economist and academic.  Born in 1931 in the town of Chalkis, Papadimitriou earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Athens in 1953 and his doctorate from the University of Cambridge in 1957. He subsequently taught at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was a professor from 1968 until his retirement in 2002. He then served as a visiting professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science, the University of Paris, and the University of Athens.  Papadimitriou is best known for his contributions to economic theory and for his work on Monetary Theory of International Trade. His most significant work includes a 1977 paper on "The New Theory of International Trade" and a 1984 article entitled "A General Equilibrium Model of International Trade". In both papers, Papadimitriou developed models that incorporated uncertainty into the analysis of international trade.  Papadimitriou also made important contributions to economic theory concerning financial markets and macroeconomic policy. His 1988 paper "The State, Money, and Credit" is considered one of the seminal works in this area.  Papadimitriou died on 11 October 2007 after a long illness. He was 83 years old.

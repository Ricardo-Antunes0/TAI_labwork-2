Filártiga v. Peña-Irala, 630 F.2d 876 (2d Cir. 1981), is a United States federal court case that determined the validity of a treaty between the United States and the Republic of Panama.  The treaty in question was signed on October 3, 1979 and ratified by the U.S. Senate on March 3, 1980. It was designed to settle a long-standing territorial dispute between the two countries over control of three small isthmuses located in the Panama Canal Zone. The isthmuses—San Lorenzo, Darien, and Balboa—were located in the Canal Zone and were claimed by both Panama and the United States.  The treaty provided that the isthmuses would be transferred to Panama, with U.S. sovereignty retained over them. Panamanian sovereignty was also granted over a strip of land linking San Lorenzo Island to the mainland. The strip of land was defined as measuring eight kilometers long by one kilometer wide.  The case before the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals was brought by Panamanian citizens residing in the isthmus areas who argued that the treaty was not valid because it did not fully transfer their territory to Panama. The court ruled in favor of the Panamanians, saying that the isthmus areas were not fully transferred and that U.S. sovereignty over them remained intact.

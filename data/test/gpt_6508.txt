The Venn Foreland  is a region of high ground on the continental shelf off the north-west coast of Wales. It forms the watershed between the Irish Sea and the Bristol Channel, and is approximately long and wide, with an average elevation of above sea level.  The Venn Foreland is notable for its geology and its role in maritime history. The area is home to a number of geological features, including the Cambrian Mountains, which are one of the oldest mountain ranges in Europe. The Venn Foreland also contains a number of important shipping routes, including the Menai Strait and the Bristol Channel.  The Venn Foreland has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic period, and during the Iron Age it was a major settlement area. The area was later occupied by the Romans, and during the Middle Ages it was part of the kingdom of Gwynedd. The Venn Foreland became part of England following the unification of England and Wales in 1536, and during the 17th century it was used as a military base by the English government. The Venn Foreland remained largely uninhabited until the mid-19th century, when it began to be populated by settlers from Wales.

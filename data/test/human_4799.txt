Bullcroft Colliery was a coal mine situated by the village of Carcroft north of Doncaster. The Bullcroft Colliery Company was formed in April 1908 and sinking of the shafts commenced immediately. In January 1909, at a depth of , a water course yielding over  per minute was struck, it was capped back and sinking continued but only a month later, at , another water course, big enough to be described as a "subterranean river", was struck - too much for the steam operated pumps to cope with. Electric pumps were brought in to cope with the flow but even with a capability of  per minute they couldn't cope and sinking was stopped so the full situation could be assessed. It was decided to withdraw the pumps and freeze the ground. Commencing January 1910 the first freeze was unsuccessful and a second, after the shafts had iron "tubbing" installed, commenced in February 1911. This was successful, and sinking recommenced finally reaching the coal measures in December 1911 at  below the surface.

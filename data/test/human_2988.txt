Parteniy Pavlovich (, "Parthenius, son of Paul") (c. 1695 – 29 April 1760) was a Bulgarian Eastern Orthodox cleric, man of letters and traveller, regarded as one of the precursors of Paisius of Hilendar. A champion of the South Slavic revival, Pavlovich was the author of the first autobiography in South Slavic literature. Education and teaching Pavlovich was born around 1695 in Silistra, a port on the Danube river located in the southwestern part of Dobruja. Then ruled by the Ottoman Empire and a major regional centre as the capital of the vast Silistra Province, today the city is part of Bulgaria. His father, Pavel, was a local Bulgarian. Parteniy began his education at the Silistra religious school under the teacher Tetradios; the curriculum at the school was in a Greek dialect. He also studied at a Bulgarian school, where he learned the literary Church Slavonic language, which he would later use in his autobiography and marginal notes. In Silistra, Pavlovich also finished a full grammar course under the teacher Palaiologos from Constantinople.

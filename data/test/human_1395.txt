Isla Bella and her sister ship Perla del Caribe are the world's first liquefied natural gas (LNG)-powered container ships. Isla Bella is currently used as part of the Florida-Puerto Rico trade, sailing out of Jacksonville, Florida and arriving in San Juan, Puerto Rico on a weekly basis. Both ships were built by NASSCO for TOTE Maritime Puerto Rico and replaced the last of the Ponce-class ships that were previously used for the route. They cost US$324 million to build and each is propelled by a single slow-speed engine capable of 25,191 kW at 104 rpm, which propels the ships at a maximum speed of 22 knots.  Isla Bella has a length of 764 feet and is 106 feet in width. It has a capacity of 3,100 TEU but can carry 20-foot, 30-foot, 40-foot, 45-foot and 53-foot containers. Isla Bella was christened on April 18 before a crowd of 3,400 people. The name Isla Bella is Spanish for “beautiful island”. The name of the vessel comes from Paola Dominguez as part of a partnership with The Puerto Rico Boys & Girls Club and TOTE.

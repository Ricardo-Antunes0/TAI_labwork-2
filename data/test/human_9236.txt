Thrill-Ville USA was an amusement park in Turner, Oregon, United States. The park was located next to the Enchanted Forest south of Salem on Interstate 5. Opened in the 1970s, the park grew to more than 20 rides before closing in 2007. Rides included roller coasters, go-karts, classic carnival rides (such as Octopus, Rock-O-Plane, Tilt-A-Whirl, Paratrooper, and many more) a  double water slide, and a regular slide. The park also had an area called "Thrill-Zone" which included a Sky Coaster, Big Sling ride, SCAD Freefall Tower, and Turbo Force. De-construction of the park's major roller coaster, the "Ripper" started in spring 2010. History In the early 1970s what later became Thrill-Ville USA opened as a go-cart track. The Vettrus family added the go-carts as a children's amusement feature next to the family's recreational vehicle (RV) park. The Vettrus brothers later owned and operated the amusement park that grew to more than 20 different rides. In 1984, the park added a  waterslide.

Fredonia is a city in Louisa County, Iowa, United States. The population was 222 at the time of the 2020 census. It is part of the Muscatine Micropolitan Statistical Area. History Fredonia was laid out in 1836, by Alvin Clark, who had a squatters claim on the land and was surveyed by John Gilliland. It is located on the east side of the Iowa River, immediately below the junction of the Iowa and Cedar rivers. It is a part of section 20, township 75, range 4 west. It is said Alvin Clark and his brother Gibbs were the first settlers in Fredonia. As such it is one of the oldest continuously-incorporated towns in Iowa. It is sometimes claimed that Fredonia came near being the capital of Iowa and only lost by 1 vote. This however, was not a truly serious consideration in the House of Representatives, as many other names were being brought up at the time.

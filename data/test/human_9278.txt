At 2:32, the track is paused and interrupted by Garbi's voice reciting the following lines: "We women are strong. And whenever necessary we know how to fight to protect what we love. We love our partner. We appreciate and respect them. That is why we want them to love us, to respect us and to appreciate us the same. We want them to stand by us. Neither to overtake us, nor to follow us. Otherwise, we leave, and move forward on our own. We are not afraid, because we are strong." The spoken work by Garbi is accompanied by a freeze frame from the music video and lasts for 34 seconds.

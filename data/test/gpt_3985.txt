The Lomas Rishi Cave, also called the Lomas Barbary Cave, is a cave located in the Bradshaw Mountains of southern Utah, United States. It is the longest known cave in North America and the tenth-longest cave in the world. The cave was first explored in 1872 by members of the Bradshaw Mountain Expedition, who named it for Lomas Barbary, an Islamic governor of Algiers.  The cave's complex system of passageways and chambers has been extensively explored and mapped, and it is now a popular tourist destination. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1978.

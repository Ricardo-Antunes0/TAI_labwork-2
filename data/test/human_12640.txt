Viale Pasubio is an avenue in Milan, Italy. It is part of the circonvallazione interna ring road, a major traffic route that runs along the former Spanish walls of Milan. The street is 350 m long and connects two former city gates, namely Porta Garibaldi (now Piazza XXV Aprile) and Porta Volta (now Piazzale Antonio Bajamonti). The street was formerly known as "Viale di Porta Garibaldi" (Porta Garibaldi Avenue), and was renamed after World War I in remembrance of the fightings on the Pasubio massif (Dolomites) that occurred during the war. The buildings in Viale Pasubio were severely damaged by Allied bombings in World War II; those on the southern side of the street were never fully restored or replaced.  The ruins have been adapted to diverse purposes: a large plant nursery has been established, and a number of slum-like, abusive settlements have formed (and have been cleared by the local police) over time.

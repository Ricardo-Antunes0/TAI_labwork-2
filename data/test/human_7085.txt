La Peste Negra (Spanish for "The Black Plague") was a Mexican lucha libre (professional wrestling) rudo, or villainous, group also known as a stable that works for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). The core of the group is the Casas wrestling family, which includes members Negro Casas and El Felino and former members Heavy Metal and Princesa Blanca. The group is rounded out by Mr. Niebla and rookies Bárbaro Cavernario and Herodes, Jr. The group was founded in July 2008 when Mr. Niebla returned to CMLL after working for Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) and has consistently been used at the main event and semi-main event level in CMLL. Their motto is "be heinous and stinky" History In July 2008 Mr. Niebla returned to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) after working for its rival Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) for over a year. Upon his return to CMLL he formed a group with Negro Casas and Heavy Metal called La Peste Negra (Spanish for "the Black Plague). The group was a rudo (bad guy) group that had a more comical approach to wrestling. The trio started wearing large afro wigs, painting their faces black and dancing during their entrances and generally worked a less serious style of match than unusual, especially for a serious wrestler like Negro Casas. On September 2, 2008 the last Casas brother, El Felino turned rudo as well and joined La Peste Negra. After Felino joined the group Heavy Metal was quietly phased out as he was not comfortable working the comedic style. Felino's wife Princesa Blanca joined the group in January 2009, turning rudo to work with La Peste Negra, the turn led to Princesa Blanca winning the Mexican National Women's Championship from Marcela on January 30, 2009.

Cecily Jordan Farrar was one of the earliest women settlers of colonial Jamestown, Virginia.  She arrived in the colony as a child in 1610 and was established as one of the few female ancient planters by 1620.  After her husband Samuel Jordan died in 1623, Cecily obtained oversight of his 450-acre plantation, Jordan's Journey. In the Jamestown Muster of 1624/25, she is one of fewer than 10 women who are mentioned as a head of household, and the only woman listed as sharing the head of household with a man she was not married to. In the year of Samuel Jordan's death, she also set off the first breach of promise lawsuit in English North America when she chose the marriage proposal of William Farrar, who was bonded to help settle her estate, over that of Greville Pooley, who claimed his proposal had already been accepted. In 1625, Cecily prevailed when Pooley withdrew his claim. Afterwards, she married William Farrar. The early years in the Virginia Colony

Emory Delmont Alvord (March 25, 1899 â€“ May 6, 1959) was an American missionary and agriculturalist.  Known for his missionary work in Rhodesia, Alvord's demonstrative methods are credited with revolutionising African agriculture. Biography  Alvord was born in Utah on March 25, 1899.  He studied for a Master of Science degree in agriculture at Washington State College and after graduation worked as a teacher, specialising in agricultural science after 1913. He joined the US Department of Agriculture's Extension Service in 1919.  The same year he volunteered to serve as a missionary with the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) and was sent to the Mount Selinda mission in Chipinge District Rhodesia as an agriculturalist.  At Mount Selinda he taught modern agricultural techniques to Africans and introduced terrace farming as a means of preserving soil cover to hillside plots. Some of the European settlers disagreed with Alvord's teachings as they enabled the African population to earn money from cash crops. In 1920 he was asked to help draw up plans for a new state-run agricultural school at Domboshawa.  As well as establishing the school Alvord spent some time there training the staff and teaching students about legumes, crop rotation, ploughing, fertilising and row planting.

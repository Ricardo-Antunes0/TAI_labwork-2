In graph theory, the Heawood conjecture or Heawoodâ€“Simons conjecture is a conjecture in the theory of graphs that concerns the existence of a graph with a certain property.  The conjecture was first proposed by Leslie Heawood and Herbert Simons in 1951. It is named for them, and also for the mathematician E. H. Moore who first described it mathematically in 1954. The conjecture states that there exists a graph with at least two vertices that are connected by an edge that is not a cycle.

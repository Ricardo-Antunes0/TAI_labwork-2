A price ceiling is a government- or industry-imposed limitation on the price of a good or service. Price ceilings are most commonly used in markets where there is a shortage of a good or service, to protect consumers from excessive price increases.  Price ceilings are controversial because they may lead to shortages and rationing of goods, and may be an ineffective way to control inflation. They are also unpopular because they can lead to increased prices for some goods and services, while others remain unchanged.

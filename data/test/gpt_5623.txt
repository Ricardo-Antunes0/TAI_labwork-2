The Parliament House is a public building in Singapore that houses both the Parliament of Singapore and the Supreme Court of Singapore. The building is located near the central business district in the city-state and was designed by British architect Sir Harold Fraser.  The Parliament House was first proposed in 1952 as a temporary home for the Parliament of Singapore, but construction did not commence until 1969 due to concerns over the country's economic stability. The building was finally completed in 1984 and was officially opened by then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. The Parliament House has been used for various Parliamentary and judicial proceedings, as well as various national events. In 2009, plans were announced to refurbish and extend the building to accommodate future needs.

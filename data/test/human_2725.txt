The Abetare is a children's textbook written in the Albanian language. It was created to help teach the basic language to children and young adults throughout Albania and the surrounding region where Albanians live. Abetare has played a significant role  in the history of Albanian education and laid the groundwork for literary Albanian which helped raise the national consciousness for future generations. By learning to read and write, young Albanians were introduced to the history and culture of their homeland. History The first alphabet book of the Albanian language titled "The very brief and useful Albanian Evetar" was written in 1844 by prominent author of the National Revival period Naum Veqilharxhi. Since that time, more than 150 revised iterations of the Abetare have been printed in Albania and abroad. Veqilharxhi's work was followed by Kostandin Kristoforidhi, another prominent figure of the National Revival period who in 1867 published his own version of the Abetare in both gheg and tosk. Three decades later, on February 27, 1897 in Istanbul, the "Alphabet of the Albanian Language" was published at the initiative of Sami FrashÃ«ri, Jani Vreto, Pashko Vasa and Koto Hoxhi, all intellectuals who had founded the Society for the Publication of Albanian Letters.

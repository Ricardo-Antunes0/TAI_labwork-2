Blackie was a swaybacked horse who, for reasons that remain unknown, became an international sensation in the early 20th century. He was known for his extreme awkward gait, which some claimed was the result of being cursed.  Blackie was born in Scotland in 1896, and quickly became renowned for his peculiar walk. Some believe that the horse's gait was actually the result of a curse, as according to legend, he had been cursed by a witch who had once ridden him. Regardless of his true origins, Blackie quickly became a popular attraction at fairs and carnivals across the world.  Sadly, Blackie's fame would not last long. In 1923 he was brought to the United States for a visit, and quickly became known as "the worst horse in the world". He was reportedly incapable of performing even the simplest tasks, and quickly became a laughing stock at circuses and fairs.  Blackie ultimately died in obscurity in 1931, but his story remains one of bizarre and tragic beauty.

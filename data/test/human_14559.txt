Dewstow House, Caldicot, Monmouthshire, Wales, is an earlier nineteenth century villa in a Neoclassical style. The house is notable as the site of "one of the strangest gardens in Wales."  The building itself is plain; described by architectural writer John Newman as a "simple three-bay villa", it has extensive views over the Severn Estuary. It is a Grade II listed building. Within, and under, the grounds lies a "network of very rare and unusual underground gardens" constructed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Comprising "underground passages and top-light chambers with artificial rock-work and stalactities,"  the garden structures have three separate Grade II* listings as a result of their importance. After the death of the garden's creator, Harry Oakley, in 1940, the gardens were gradually abandoned. In the 1960s, during the construction of the M4 motorway and the Severn Bridge, soil from these sites was used to fill in the grottoes and pools.

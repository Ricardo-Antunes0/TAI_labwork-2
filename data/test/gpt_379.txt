In IBM System z9 and successor mainframes, the Zero Insertion, Initialization, and Parsing (ZIIP) instruction is a 32-bit general-purpose ALU instruction that is used for floating-point arithmetic, bitwise operations, and string manipulation.  ZIIP is also the name of a programming language created in conjunction with System z9.

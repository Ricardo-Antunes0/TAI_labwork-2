SERVIR-Mekong project is a joint initiative by the US agency for International Development (USAID), NASA and five other countries which are Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. "Servir" is a Spanish word which means "to serve". The project aims to use the latest technologies to help the Mekong river region protect its vital ecosystem. It helps to connect USAID's development network with NASA's technology and satellite data to provide mapping information and satellite imagery. History The first such experimental hub was launched in Panama in 2005 to serve the near region. The project was initially undertaken by researchers at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama. In the Earth Observation Summit, 2007, SERVIR was recognized as a model for the effectuation of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). In 2010, the organisation had a presence in the Himalayas when a hub, SERVIR-Himalaya, was established at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) in Kathmandu, Nepal. The organization has launched similar projects in the past for other regions in Latin America, Africa and Asia.

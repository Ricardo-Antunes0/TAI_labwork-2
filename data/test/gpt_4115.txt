The Roman Inquisition, formally the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office, was a tribunal in the Catholic Church that operated from 1233 to 1814. It was initially established to deal with heresy, but its remit gradually expanded to include religious blasphemy, heretical teachings in general, witchcraft, and other forms of religious dissent.  The Inquisition was abolished by the French Revolution and later revived by Pope Pius VII in 1814. It has been the subject of criticism for its alleged victims and for its perceived activities, which included torture and execution. The Roman Inquisition is considered one of the most notorious and tragic episodes in the history of the Catholic Church.

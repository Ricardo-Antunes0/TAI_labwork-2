Joseph L. Kearney (April 28, 1927 – May 5, 2010) was an American coach and sports administrator in university athletics.  He served as athletic director at three major universities: the University of Washington (1969–1976), Michigan State University (1976–1980), and Arizona State University (1980).  He was commissioner of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) from 1980 until his retirement in 1994. Career After serving in the United States Navy during World War II, Kearney attended Seattle Pacific University and attained his BA degree in history.  He was also a member of the SPU basketball team.  This was then followed by teaching and coaching stints in Paradise High School (Paradise, California); the University of Washington (as assistant basketball coach for Tippy Dye) and Sunnyside High School (Sunnyside, Washington).  He then became a high school principal in the state of Washington when he was hired by Onalaska High School (Onalaska, Washington), where he also taught and coached.  In 1961, he was appointed as the inaugural principal at Tumwater High School in Tumwater, Washington.  He concurrently pursued and completed a master's degree in education at San Jose State University and moved back to the University of Washington to finish his PhD, where he was also strongly linked to the UW Athletic Department and quickly rose to the rank of assistant athletic director under Jim Owens, who was Washington's football coach and athletic director when Kearney joined the Athletic Department.  From this position, he was appointed athletic director for the University of Washington when Owens decided to focus solely on his job as football coach.

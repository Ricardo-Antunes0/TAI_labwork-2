In engineering, some methods or components make use of an overhead or overhead line. These methods or components can be classified into three groups:  1. Methods or components using an overhead line to suspend the workpiece, such as swing arms, gantry machines, and cranes.  2. Methods or components that use an overhead line to move the workpiece between different positions, such as CNC machines and extrusion machines.  3. Methods or components that use an overhead line to hold the workpiece in a particular position, such as laser cutters and 3D printers.

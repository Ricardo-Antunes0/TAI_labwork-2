The Joint Intelligence Operations Center Europe (JIOCEUR) Analytic Center (JAC), formerly known as the Joint Analysis Center, is a Joint Intelligence Center serving as a military intelligence analysis centre for the United States European Command located at RAF Molesworth, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom and managed by the Defense Intelligence Agency. The area of responsibility includes over 50 countries in Europe, 33 Sub-Saharan and West African countries, and the Middle East. It was moved to Molesworth in 1992 with all Tactical Intelligence assets coming from ODCSINT USAREUR/7A and all Administration and Strategic Intelligence assets coming from Stuttgart. Staff Sergeant (SSG) Joy√© LaBarge Gecowetts was the first "Plank Owner" at the JAC as she moved all Tactical Intelligence assets from ODCSINT USAREUR/7A at Campbell Barracks, Heidelberg, Germany, as their Noncommissioned Officer In Charge (NCOIC) of the Ground Order of Battle Division (GOBD). SSG "Jake" Gecowetts, a Senior Tactical and Strategic Intelligence Analyst, was also the first US Army Soldier assigned to England from USAREUR/7A since World War II.

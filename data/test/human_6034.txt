DAISY is a band based in Los Angeles, California. DAISY is composed of Daisy Hamel-Buffa, Alex Kasvikis, Maxx Morando, Matt Fildey, and Ben Roswell Salk. Their genre has been described as "loud jazz" and "R&B punk." History  DAISY has been making music together since 2014, with connections to The Internet because they "just kind of lived down the street from my friend," explained Daisy Hamel-Buffa for Impose Magazine. DAISY released their first album, Smoke About It in 2016. DAISY released their first single in 2018 with "Still Here" off their album Have A Snack. The track "Still Here" was originally supposed to feature a rap verse but when that fell through, the verse was replaced with a call-and-response verse with pitched vocals. In 2019 they released their second single named "Day Off." The beat for "Day Off" was provided by The Internet's Matt Martians and Hamel-Buffa wrote the lyrics about "this very big crush I had on this boy that works at the Trader Joe's down my street and having this unsolicited crush on this guy and does he even know that I exist, and does he notice that I'm obsessed with him," as she explained in an interview with The FADER. The music video for "Day Off" was directed by Seannie Bryan.

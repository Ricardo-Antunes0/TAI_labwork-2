Poison dart frog (also known as dart-poison frog, frog-venom frog, and cascading poison frog) is a common name for a group of frogs in the family Dendrobatidae. Species within this group are known to produce toxic secretions from their skin, which can be harmful if ingested.  Poison dart frogs are found in the Americas, Central and South America, as well as Southeast Asia. They inhabit moist habitats such as rain forests and streams. Many of these frogs are brightly colored and often have distinctive markings on their skin.  The venom of poison dart frogs is toxic to both humans and other animals. While most people are not harmed by the secretions, those with allergies or sensitivity to toxins should avoid touching or handling these frogs.

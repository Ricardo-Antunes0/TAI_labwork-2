, is a Japanese saving method. The word is derived from the verb "kakei" (to save, to guard), and refers to the practice of setting aside a designated amount of money or other valuable items in case of an emergency.   Kakeibo is most commonly used in Japan, where it is considered a folk practice. It can be used to save for any purpose, such as for a rainy day, a car repair, or to cover an unexpected bill. Kakeibo can also be used as a source of liquid savings, as people typically set aside a fixed percentage of their income for kakeibo.

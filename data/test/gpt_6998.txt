Ethel Jackson Morris (1891–1985) was an Australian artist, best known for her paintings of Aboriginal people.  Morris was born in Melbourne, Australia on 1891 to Richard Morris and his wife Annie (née Lamb). She began her artistic training at the Melbourne School of Arts in 1907, and then studied at the National Gallery of Victoria under Arthur Streeton and John Peter Russell. In 1919, she travelled to Paris to continue her education at the Académie Julian.  Upon her return to Australia, Morris exhibited her work at the Sydney Salon and the Melbourne Salon. In 1925, she won the Wynne Prize for her painting "Aboriginal Woman". Between 1926 and 1933, Morris travelled extensively throughout Australia, painting scenes of Aboriginal life.   In 1934, Morris was awarded a commission by the Australian Government to paint a series of portraits of prominent Australians for the National Library of Australia. She continued to produce paintings throughout her life, most notably "Bushmen" (1947), which was purchased by the Australian government in 1978 and is now part of the National Gallery of Australia collection. Morris died in 1985.

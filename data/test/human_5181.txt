Tysnes Church  is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Tysnes Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. It is located in the village of Våge on the northern shore of the island of Tysnesøya. It is the church for the Tysnes parish which is part of the Sunnhordland prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church design in 1867 using plans drawn up by the architects Georg Andreas Bull and Hartvig Sverdrup Eckhoff. The church seats about 370 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1329, but it was not new at that time. The first church here was a wooden stave church located at Tysnes, about  north of the present church site. It was likely built during the 13th century. From 1685 to 1688, the old church was torn down and a new timber-framed long church was built on the same site. It was built by Erik Fyllingsnes from Lindaas and Oluf Bysemb from Osterøy.

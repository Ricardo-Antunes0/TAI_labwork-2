Handstyle or hand style is a term in graffiti culture denoting the unique handwriting or signature/tag of an artist, also known as a writer. The same way that in typography there are different typefaces or fonts, in graffiti there are different handstyles. Similarly to the way a typographer would focus on typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), a writer would focus on line lengths, line direction, line curvature, letter size and letter balance.  The concept of having unique and expressive handstyles developed slowly. When graffiti first started in the '70s, a tag's style was the writer's personal handwriting. In the New York and Philadelphia in the mid '70s, different writers and crews started stylizing and personalizing their tags. Over time, the concept of a handstyle emerged through the stylising of these tags. Today specific handstyles are associated to specific writers, crews, gangs and even cities, such as the Philly Handstyle.

Filippo Scannabecchi (1352 â€“ c. 1410), known as Lippo di Dalmasio, was an Italian painter of the Early Renaissance.  Born in Siena, he is best known for his frescoes in the Palazzo Pubblico of Siena, and the Gallery of the Uffizi in Florence. He also painted a "Last Supper" for the Duomo of Siena, as well as a "Moses receiving the Torah" for the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence.  He was described by Vasari as "the most eminent painter of his time... his excellence is seen not only in his own works but also in those of his pupils".

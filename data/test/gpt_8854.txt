In the colony of New South Wales, the first census was held in 1823. The aim of the census was to determine the number of European settlers, the number of convicts, and the number of landholders. The census also counted the aboriginal population.   The census was conducted by counting heads of households. Each household was asked to give an estimate of the number of people living in it. The census was not voluntary and many people refused to take part. In 1825, a second census was held to correct errors made in the first census.

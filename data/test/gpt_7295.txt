Dendrobium toressae, commonly known as the sparkle orchid, is a species of orchid native to central and southern Queensland.  The orchid grows in tall, slender stems up to 50 cm tall and has a single, bright yellow flower which is held above a long green stem. The flowers have a strong fragrance and are often pollinated by insects such as bees.  The orchid is found in open forests and near creeks and rivers. It is threatened by the destruction of its habitat and the illegal trade of the flowers.

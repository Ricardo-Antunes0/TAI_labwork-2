The Object 416 (Russian: Объект 416) is a Russian nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that was first deployed in the late 1960s. It is currently the longest-range ICBM in the Russian arsenal, with a maximum range of 8,000 kilometers (5,500 miles). The Object 416 has been replaced by the newer and more advanced Object 956 ICBM.

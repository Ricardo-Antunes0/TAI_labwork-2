Jurjentje Aukes Rauwerda (14 December 1812, in Rauwerda â€“ 6 March 1884, in Amsterdam) was a Dutch painter.  Born in Rauwerda, Aukes moved to Amsterdam in 1827 to study with Pieter de Hooch. After de Hooch's death in 1849, she continued her studies at the Royal Academy of Arts in Amsterdam with Gerard ter Borch and Jan Toorop. Her earliest works focus on historical and mythological subjects, but she soon branched out into domestic scenes and genre scenes of everyday life. She was a member of the artists' society "De Kunstkring" and exhibited her work at their exhibitions from 1853 onward.

Polymerisation inhibitors (US: polymerization inhibitors) are chemical compounds added to monomers to prevent their auto-polymerisation. Unsaturated monomers such as acrylates, vinyl chloride, butadiene and styrene require inhibitors for both processing and safe transport and storage. Many monomers are purified industrially by distillation, which can lead to thermally initiated polymerisation. Styrene for example is distilled at temperatures above 100 °C whereupon it undergoes thermal polymerisation at a rate of ~2% per hour. This polymerisation is undesirable, as it can foul the fractionating tower, it is also typically exothermic which can lead to a runaway reaction and potential explosion if left unchecked. Once initiated polymerisation is typically radical in mechanism and as such many polymerisation inhibitors act as radical scavengers. Inhibitors vs Retarders The term 'inhibitor' is often used in a general sense to describe any compound used to prevent unwanted polymerisation, however these compounds are often divided into 'retarders' and 'true inhibitors'. A true inhibitor has a well defined induction period during which no noticeable polymerisation takes place. They are consumed during this period and once gone polymerisation occurs as normal. Retarders display no induction period but provide a permanent decrease in the rate of polymerisation, while themselves being degraded only slowly. Attempts have been made to define the difference quantitatively in terms of reaction rate. In an industrial setting compounds from both classes will usually be used together, with the true inhibitor providing optimal plant performance and the retarder acting as a failsafe.

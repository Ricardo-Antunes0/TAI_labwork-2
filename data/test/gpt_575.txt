Pure John Gorka is a "best of" compilation album by the Hungarian-born American rock musician John Gorka, released in 1978. It was issued on LP, cassette and CD by A&M Records.  The album comprises recordings from the period from 1967 to 1978, when Gorka was a member of the band The Outsiders. It features covers of songs by The Beatles, The Kinks, The Rolling Stones, Otis Redding and others.  Allmusic critic Stewart Mason wrote of the album "Pure John Gorka is an entertaining compendium of Outsider rock highlights from the late '60s and early '70s, including some excellent covers of classic British Invasion songs. Although not as essential as some of Gorka's later work, it's worth checking out for any fans of early hard rock."

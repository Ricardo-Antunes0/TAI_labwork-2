In World War II espionage, the Lucy spy ring was a group of female United States intelligence agents who operated in Nazi-occupied Europe.  The Lucy spy ring was first identified in 1944, when the Office of Strategic Services (OSS; later to become the Central Intelligence Agency [CIA]) discovered that a group of women had been passing classified information to the British. The ring consisted of eight women, all of whom were employed by the American intelligence service as secretaries or stenographers. Over the course of the war, they transmitted over 1,000 messages to British intelligence, helping to save thousands of lives.  The Lucy spy ring remains a highly sensitive subject; although several members have since been identified, the precise circumstances surrounding their recruitment and role in the ring remain largely unknown.

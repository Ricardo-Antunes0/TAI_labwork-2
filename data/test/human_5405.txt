The Metcalfe Bond Stores is a heritage-listed former bond store and warehouse and now shops and offices located at 68-84 George Street in the inner city Sydney suburb of The Rocks in the City of Sydney local government area of New South Wales, Australia. It was built from 1912 to 1916. It is also known as New Metcalfe Bond Stores. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002. History  The building stands upon the site of the former garden and orchard for Robert Campbell's Wharf House (1800-1883), itself on a grant made to Campbell on 29 June 1814. Part of it was later used as a quarry. The existing stone retaining wall at George Street probably dates from the mid to late 19th century. For much of the 19th century the site was apparently used as Campbell's garden and was acquired by the Colonial Government in 1887 and then used as a stone quarry. In 1900 the site was vested in the NSW Government as part of the Darling Harbour Resumptions, following the outbreak of bubonic plague.

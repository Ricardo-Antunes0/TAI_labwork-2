Knights Out is an organization of West Point alumni, staff and faculty who support the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people to serve openly in the U.S. military and who wish to educate young officers about the issues and contributions of LGBT troops. The group's name is in reference to the Army Black Knights, West Point's athletic mascot. History In January 2009, two United States Military Academy alumni, L Paul Morris '80, and Dan Manning '04, along with Annapolis graduate Steve Clark Hall, USNA '75, started work to establish a West Point organization parallel to USNA Out, the LGBT alumni association of the United States Naval Academy. At the time, L. Paul Morris was serving as the chair of SAGALA, the joint service academy gay and lesbian alumni network, while Dan Manning was the USMA board representative. This led to the founding of Knights Out in March 2009.

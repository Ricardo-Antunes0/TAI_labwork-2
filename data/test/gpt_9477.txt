The infrared atmospheric window refers to a layer of the Earth's atmosphere that allows significant amounts of radiation from the Sun to reach the Earth's surface. The window is located near the tropopause, and is approximately 10 to 20 kilometers wide. It opens during solar maxima and closes during solar minima.

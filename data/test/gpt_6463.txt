Eardwulf (fl. 790 –  830) was king of Northumbria from 790 to 830. He was the son of Oswald, a Scot, and the brother of Æthelfrith of Northumbria. He succeeded his father in 790, and was initially subject to his uncle, Æthelred I of Mercia. In 805 he defeated an army sent by Æthelred to besiege him at York. In 810 he made a treaty with Æthelred, whereby the latter recognised him as king of all Northumbria, and Eardwulf granted him the city of York as a residence. In 812 Eardwulf fought a successful war against the Welsh, and in 816 he defeated an army sent by Guthrum, king of East Anglia, at the Battle of Fulford.  In 819 Eardwulf fought a war with Wessex, but was unsuccessful. In 820 he made peace with Wessex, and in 821 he fought a war with Mercia but again was unsuccessful. In 824 he made peace with Mercia and in 828 he fought a war with East Anglia but again was unsuccessful. In 829 Eardwulf made peace with East Anglia and in 830 died of natural causes. Eardwulf is often considered one of the most successful Anglo-Saxon kings. He is also noted for his building projects, most notably the construction of Hexham Abbey.

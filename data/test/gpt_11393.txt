"Thumbs Up! is an original, never-before-seen musical comedy that tells the story of four friends—Jerry, Vince, Julie, and Rick—who are trying to make it in Hollywood. They're young, talented, and full of energy, but they're also up against the odds. Jerry is a wannabe actor; Vince is a struggling musician; Julie is a waitress with a big dream; and Rick is an unemployed writer. Despite their differences, the four of them band together to take on the tough competition and make it in the entertainment business. Along the way, they'll face challenges such as auditions, disagreements, and even breakups. But in the end, they'll find that together they have more power than any one of them could ever imagine."  The show features music by Russ Ballard (who also wrote the book) and choreography by Sergio Trujillo. It has been seen by over 1 million people worldwide since its premiere in 2006.

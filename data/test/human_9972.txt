Fulton Lewis III (January 25, 1936 - September 6, 2017) was an American journalist, the only son of the late network American news commentator Fulton Lewis Jr. and Alice Huston Lewis. Education and early career Fulton Lewis III attended Landon School in Bethesda, Maryland and the University of Virginia, graduating from the latter in 1957.  His first job was News Director of a small station in Jamestown, New York but soon afterwards (1959) he was hired by the House Un-American Activities Committee of the U.S. Congress as its Research Director. The following year, he produced and narrated the Committee's documentary film of the May 1960 riots in San Francisco protesting the Committee's hearings there. The script was written by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and showed evidence of involvement by members of the Communist Party USA in the incitement and leadership of the riots. In 1961, Lewis resigned from the Committee to embark on a nationwide lecture/debate tour in defense of the validity of the film. He appeared on over 750 college and university campuses.

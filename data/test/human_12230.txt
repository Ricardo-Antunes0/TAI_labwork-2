Hollyoaks Later (originally Late Night Hollyoaks) is a British television spin-off of the Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks. The series allows for more sexual content, 'edgier' storylines and stronger language than Hollyoaks. The show was on hiatus from 2014 to 2020, where it returned on 6 January 2020 for a one-off episode focusing on the conclusion of Breda McQueen's (Moya Brady) serial killer storyline. Concept Hollyoaks Later was devised after Hollyoaks had improved ratings. Tony Wood, creative director of Lime Pictures the production company of Hollyoaks, explained that it was decided that Hollyoaks would be expanded on because of its increased audience. Camilla Campbell, the commissioning editor for drama at Channel 4, said that Hollyoaks had grown up in "eyes of the viewers" and had begun being taken seriously by the television industry and critics. This meant that a late night slot for Hollyoaks allows for writers and producers to take "the drama to another level and show some willies and fannies, whilst also keeping the fun playfulness that Hollyoaks fans love". The series is darker in tone than parent show Hollyoaks and "explores issues difficult to dramatise in-depth before the watershed". Lime Pictures described the show and its purpose saying that "the series delves deeper into the lives, loves and misdemeanours of the Hollyoaks regulars, shedding their teen image as they look to find their feet away from the Village".

GOES-16, formerly known as GOES-R before reaching full operational capability, is a geostationary weather satellite operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for meteorological and climatic purposes. The satellite was constructed by Lockheed Martin, with its launch taking place on August 3, 2017.  GOES-16 is designed to provide improved accuracy and timeliness of weather forecasts than earlier geostationary satellites. It will also be capable of providing new images of Earth's surface that can be used for mapping and land management applications.

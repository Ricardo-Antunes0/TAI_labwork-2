Standing Bear (c. 1829–1908) (Ponca official orthography: Tashbaantuŋa Wabasha) was a Ponca chief, or tribal leader, who resisted United States expansion into the Great Lakes region in the mid-19th century. He is most notable for his resistance to the US Army in 1876, during the Battle of the Little Bighorn.  Standing Bear was born circa 1829 in present-day Nebraska, likely near what is now Eagle Butte. He was a member of the Ponca Tribe and a prominent chief. In 1876, he led a resistance against US expansion into the Great Lakes region. The US Army attempted to march into his territory, and Standing Bear fought them off. The battle is notable for being one of the most bloody in American history, with over 500 casualties on both sides. Standing Bear was eventually defeated, and he was exiled to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) in 1877. He died there in 1908.

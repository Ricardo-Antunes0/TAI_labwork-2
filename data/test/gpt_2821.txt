The New Mexico class was a class of battleships built by the United States Navy in the early 20th century. The class consisted of four ships, all commissioned between 1905 and 1907. The ships were designed to counter the growing power of the Imperial Japanese Navy, and they played a significant role in the US victory in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905.  The New Mexico class was a significant advance over previous US battleships. They were larger and had more powerful guns, making them better suited for combat against larger enemy ships. The class also had a more advanced design than previous US battleships, making them less vulnerable to fire from enemy shore batteries.  The New Mexico class played a key role in the US victory in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. They destroyed several Japanese ships, including two destroyers and a cruiser, and helped protect US forces ashore during the Battle of Port Arthur. The class also played a role in the Battle of Tsushima, where they helped repel a Japanese invasion fleet.  The New Mexico class was replaced by the Nevada class in 1911. All four ships of the New Mexico class were scrapped between 1928 and 1931.

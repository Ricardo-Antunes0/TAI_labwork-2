Career Rowbotham began his professional career in 1987 with Plymouth Argyle, spending five years at Home Park.

In his three years with Rovers, Rowbotham suffered relegation from the Premier Division but won the resulting First Division, with a League Cup win in between.

In his two years at Adams Park, Rowbotham featured in over thirty matches and after a loan spell with first club Plymouth, returned to the club for a second permanent spell in 1997. Following his release in 2000, Rowbotham played a handful of matches for Torquay United on a non-contract basis before leaving in January 2001 and finishing his career in non-league football with Weymouth and Merthyr Tydfil.

It is located on the banks of the Waikato River, about halfway between Hamilton and Tauranga. The population was 4,716 at the 2013 census.  The township was originally settled by a group of MƒÅori in 1841. It was named after Tataraimaka, a major chief on the island of Rangitoto. The first settler, William Wakefield, arrived in 1842 and established a farm on the banks of the Waikato River. The township was initially known as Wakefield's Settlement. The first school was opened in 1859 and the township became a municipality in 1874.  The township has a strong agricultural background and is home to many dairy farms, as well as large orchards and vineyards. Tataraimaka also has a significant manufacturing sector, including car parts and machinery factories. The main tourist attraction is Tataraimaka Caves, which are located about south of the township.

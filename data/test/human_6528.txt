He went on to play for many years in Belgian football, including seven seasons in the First Division, for Charleroi, La Louvière, Francs Borains and Sambreville. Life and career Pugh was born in Corbridge, Northumberland, and attended Framwellgate Moor Comprehensive School in Durham. Offered trials by several clubs, he chose to begin his club career with Newcastle United. He made only one substitute appearance for the club's first team, on 7 November 1981, replacing Imre Varadi in a 2–1 defeat at Chelsea in the Second Division. He was released at the end of that season, and dropped into non-league football with Gateshead, playing regularly as they won the 1982–83 Northern Premier League title and with it promotion to the Alliance Premier League. He began the new season with Gateshead, joined Darlington for long enough to make two substitute appearances in the Fourth Division, and was back with Gateshead by October. He finished his Gateshead career with 24 goals from 76 appearances in all competitions, 5 goals from 36 appearances in the Alliance Premier League.

The Tampico Affair began as a minor border incident between the United States and Mexico on October 14, 1914. It quickly escalated into a full-blown diplomatic crisis between the two countries, culminating in the United States' declaration of war on Mexico on April 25, 1917. The crisis ultimately led to the breakup of the Mexican Empire and the rise of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), as well as the death of General Porfirio Díaz.  The Tampico Affair began when a group of American sailors aboard the USS Panther allegedly fired upon a group of Mexican soldiers stationed onshore. The Mexicans responded by sending in reinforcements, and an all-out battle ensued. The Panther was eventually destroyed and several American sailors were killed. The Mexicans claimed that the Americans had fired first, and the United States responded by declaring war on Mexico.  The United States quickly overwhelmed Mexico's military forces, and by April 1917 had occupied much of northern Mexico. In response, Díaz resigned as president and fled to exile in Europe. The United States installed a provisional government led by General Victoriano Huerta, who quickly began to consolidate his power. Huerta's rule was soon challenged by radical factions within Mexico City, notably the Revolutionary Socialist Party (P SR) and the Mexican Communist Party (PCM).  In February 1920, Huerta was overthrown by a military coup led by General Pancho Villa. Villa's rule was short-lived, however; he was assassinated in March

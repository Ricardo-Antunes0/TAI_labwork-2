Sir Michael Anthony Eardley Dummett  (27 October 1918 â€“ 10 October 2018) was a British mathematician and logician who made significant contributions to mathematics, especially to mathematical logic, set theory, and philosophy of mathematics. He was also an acclaimed writer on mathematics, philosophy and other subjects.  Dummett was born in Belfast, the son of a tailor. After attending Belfast High School for Boys, he studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he received his B.A. in 1938 and his M.A. in 1941. He then served in the Royal Artillery during World War II, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel.  After the war, Dummett returned to Trinity College, where he became a fellow in 1949. In 1951 he was awarded a doctorate for his thesis "On a Certain Model of Proof". He then joined the University of Cambridge faculty as a lecturer in mathematics. In 1962 he was promoted to reader and professor of mathematics there.  In 1967 Dummett moved to the University of Oxford as Rouse Ball Professor of Logic and Philosophy; he remained at Oxford until his retirement in 1984. In 1977 he was elected to the Royal Society and in 1978 he became a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.  Dummett's most important work is in mathematical logic, including two books on the subject: "Logical Positivism" (1951) and "Mathematical Logic" (1959). In this work he defended logical positivism against various objections and developed the now-standard

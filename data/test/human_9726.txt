The MPL-50 (, malaya pekhotnaya lopata-50, small infantry spade-50) is a small spade ( length) invented by Danish officer Mads Johan Buch Linnemann in 1869. It was used by rank and file military personnel in the Russian Empire, Soviet Union and its successor states since late 19th century. While nominally an entrenching tool, the MPL-50 saw wide ranged wartime applications ranging from a close quarters combat weapon to a cooking utensil. History The MPL-50 was invented in 1869 by the Danish officer Mads Johan Buch Linnemann. In 1870 it was patented and supplied to the Danish Army. The next year it was adopted by the much bigger Austrian Army, and Linnemann founded a factory in Vienna to produce his spade. It was later introduced to Germany, France, Romania and Russia, though only Russia recognized Linnemann's patent rights, and paid him 30,000 rubles and ordered 60,000 spades. The MPL-50 remained almost unchanged through its history in Russia and the Soviet Union; attempts to introduce a folded-handle design not being approved.

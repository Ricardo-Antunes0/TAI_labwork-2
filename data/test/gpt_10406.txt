The Pacific angelshark (Squatina californica) is a species of shark in the family Carcharhinidae. It is found in coastal waters of the western North Pacific, from southern California to Japan. This species can reach a length of 1.8 metres (6.1 ft).  The Pacific angelshark has a slender body with a short head and moderately long pectoral fins. The skin is smooth and lacks scales, and is colorless to light brown above and cream below. The eyes are small and located just in front of the snout. The mouth is small and toothless, with small gills on the roof of the mouth. There are no anal fins, but there are well-developed pelvic fins. The Pacific angelshark is a ambush predator that feeds mainly on fish, but has been known to feed on other animals such as seabirds and marine mammals.

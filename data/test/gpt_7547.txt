Earle Francis Brucker Sr. (May 6, 1901 â€“ March 30, 1984) was an American mathematician, who made significant contributions to the theory of operator algebras and mathematical physics.  Earle Francis Brucker was born on May 6, 1901 in Buffalo, New York. After completing his undergraduate studies at Cornell University in 1923, he received his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1928 under the direction of David Hilbert.  Brucker spent most of his career at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was a professor from 1949 until his retirement in 1974. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He died on March 30, 1984.  Brucker's research in mathematics focused on Operator algebras and mathematical physics. In particular, he developed the theory of operator algebras as a tool for understanding problems in statistical mechanics and fluid dynamics. His work has had a profound impact on these fields, and has been cited more than 2,000 times.

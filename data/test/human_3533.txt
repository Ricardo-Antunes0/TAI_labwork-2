Heugel was a French music publishing company, founded in 1839, that became one of the most prolific and ubiquitous businesses of its kind in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. It was taken over in 1980 by Alphonse Leduc and dissolved in 2014. Founding years The French music publishing house of Heugel was founded on 1 January 1839 in Paris by Jacques-Léopold Heugel (1 March 1815 – 12 November 1883) and Jean-Antoine Meissonnier (1783–1857). Heugel was born in La Rochelle and was active as a music teacher in Nantes before he came to Paris. The company branded initially as "A. Meissonnier et J. L. Heugel". Until 1974, the seat of the company was at 2bis, rue Vivienne. After four years, Meissonnier sold his share to Heugel to concentrate on his own business, which was brought to success by his son, Jean-Racine Meissonnier. From then on, the company added "Au Ménestrel" to its name, alluding to the weekly music journal Le Ménestrel, which was founded in 1833 by Joseph Hippolyte L'Henry at the same address and that had been taken over by Heugel and Meissonnier. Le Ménestrel provided a convenient publicising forum for the music publishing business, also including, for a time, music supplements for the journal's subscribers. It was published by Heugel and his successors until 1940, with only a short interruption during World War I.

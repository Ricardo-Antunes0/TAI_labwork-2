The Renault Juvaquatre  is a small, rear-wheel-drive sports car that was produced by the French automaker Renault between 1968 and 1976. It was the company's first small sports car, and was initially powered by a 1.5-liter inline-four engine.  The Juvaquatre competed in a range of racing series during its production life, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the World Sportscar Championship. It also achieved some success in the street racing circuit, winning several championships. The car has since been largely supplanted by more modern models from Renault, but remains a popular collector's item.

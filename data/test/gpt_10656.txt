After completing his secondary education at the Government Arts College in Tiruchirapalli, he studied mathematics at the University of Madras, where he obtained his M.A. in 1912 and his Ph.D. in 1916.

He died there on November 22, 1974.  Ramakrishnan's work in mathematics has had a profound impact on twentieth century philosophy and mathematical thought. His contributions to set theory, functional analysis, metric spaces, topology and other areas have been highly influential and are still being studied today. He is also considered to be one of the founders of modern mathematical philosophy.

Larry La Trobe is the name given to a popular, cast bronze statue of a dog situated on the northern end of Melbourne's City Square (corner of Collins Street and Swanston Street). Along with the Burke and Wills monument, the statue is one of only two free standing art works in the City Square precinct. The statue now located in the square is the second statue of 'Larry', the original having been stolen. History Melbourne artist Pamela Irving created the statue as a result of a commission from the Melbourne City Council in 1992 and it was the first sculpture for Melbourne's Open Air Sculpture Museum. Based on her own dog, Lucy, the statue is not representative of any particular breed but was crafted to generate a sense of Australian larrikinism in the viewer. Irving named the statue after her uncle Larry and the surname 'La Trobe' was appended to represent the relationship with Melbourne and the state of Victoria. Charles La Trobe was the first Lieutenant-Governor of the state of Victoria.

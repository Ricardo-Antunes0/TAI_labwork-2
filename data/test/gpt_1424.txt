Potheridge (alias Great Potheridge, Poderigge, Poderidge or Potheridge Manor) is a historic manor house in Northumberland, England. It is located about south-west of Morpeth and about north-east of Newcastle upon Tyne.  The manor house is situated on a hill overlooking the River Tyne, in the hamlet of Potheridge. The surrounding countryside is rural and agricultural. The manor was originally built by the de Potheridges in the 12th century, but it was extensively rebuilt in the 16th century by Sir Ralph Poderidge (1560–1625), who also constructed nearby Poderiggia Castle. The manor passed through the Poderidges' family until 1728, when it was sold to Sir George Carteret. In 1792, the manor house and estate were sold to Richard Bolingbroke, 3rd Viscount Bolingbroke (1751–1830), who had it redesigned by James Wyatt. The Bolingbroke family retained ownership of the manor until 1964, when it was sold to the National Trust for England.  The manor is now a hotel and restaurant, known as Potheridge Manor Hotel and Potheridge Manor Restaurant.

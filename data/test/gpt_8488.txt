Bunhill Fields is a former burial ground in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It is located in the East End of London, on the boundary between Whitechapel and Bethnal Green.  Bunhill Fields was opened in 1657 and was originally just an open field. It became a burial ground in 1795, when the nearby St Bartholomew's Churchyard filled up. It was closed in 1856, although some burials continued until 1885. In 1907, it was bought by the City of London Corporation and used as a dump until it was closed in 1964. It has been a nature reserve since 1971.  The site is now a protected open space, with a visitors' centre and gardens open to the public. The site is also home to a large population of birds, including swans, grebes, ducks and coots.

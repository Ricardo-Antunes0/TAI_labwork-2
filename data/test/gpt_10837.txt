The Road to Indy Presented by Cooper Tires is an open-wheel racing series that runs in the United States and Canada. The series is sanctioned by IndyCar and is made up of races that are part of the IndyCar Series and the Cooper Tires USF2000 Championship. The Road to Indy is open to drivers who are not signed to a full-time IndyCar team.  The Road to Indy began in 2008 as a way for drivers who were not signed by a full-time IndyCar team to compete in races around North America. In its inaugural year, the series consisted of eight races. The following year, the series increased to ten races, and has since grown to include thirty events. In 2017, the series was renamed the Road to Indy Presented by Cooper Tires in order to better reflect its focus on junior drivers.  The Road to Indy is divided into three stages: the Pre-season Program, the Cooper Tires USF2000 Championship, and the IndyCar Series. The Pre-season Program consists of four rounds of races that are open to all drivers, including those who are not signed by a full-time IndyCar team. The Cooper Tires USF2000 Championship is a series of ten races that features drivers who are not signed by a full-time IndyCar team. The Indianapolis 500 is the only race in the IndyCar Series that is open to drivers who are not signed by a full-time IndyCar team.

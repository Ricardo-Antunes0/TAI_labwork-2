A motion compensator is a device that decreases the undesirable effects of the relative motion between two connected objects.  Motion compensators are usually placed between a floating object and a more stationary object, such as a vessel or a structure fixed to the seabed. The motion compensator does not prevent the motion, but tries to eliminate the negative effects of the movement. These negative effects include (1) the changes in force and stresses, and (2) the hysteresis, i.e., the rapid start-and-stop "jerking" of the objects.  A heave compensator is a kind of motion compensator. Whereas most motion compensators will compensate for movement in all directions, the heave compensator will compensate for movement in only one direction, for instance, for vertical movement. In practice, the words motion compensator and heave compensator are used interchangeably. Sensor technologies being used are inertial sensors and GNSS (example: iMAR Navigation) or image processing.

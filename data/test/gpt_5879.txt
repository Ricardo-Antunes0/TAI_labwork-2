Pax Nicephori, Latin for the "Peace of Nicephorus," was a treaty between the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire and the Sasanian Empire which ended the long-standing conflict between the two empires. The treaty was signed in 829 at the Nicean conference and ratified by Emperor Michael III in 836.  The long-standing conflict between the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire and the Sasanian Empire was due to their mutual rivalry for control of the Middle East and Central Asia. The two empires had been fighting each other since the late 4th century AD. The Byzantines had a strong advantage in terms of manpower, wealth, and naval power, while the Sasanians were skilled in siege warfare.  In 419, the Sasanian Emperor Khosrau I captured Constantinople, which marked the end of the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire. In 565, however, the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Emperor Justinian I reconquered Constantinople, marking the beginning of their resurgence as a superpower. The Byzantines continued to expand their territory throughout Asia Minor and into Syria and Anatolia. The Sasanians, meanwhile, lost control of most of their territory in Central Asia, including their capital Ctesiphon.  The long-standing conflict between the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire and the Sasanian Empire came to an end with the Peace of Nicephorus. The treaty was signed in 829 at the Nicean conference and ratified by Emperor Michael III in 836. The main concessions made by the Byzantines

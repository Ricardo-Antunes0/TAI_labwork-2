Dame Mabel June Hinekahukura Mariu  (née Williams; 3 October 1893 – 8 December 1978) was a New Zealand artist, suffragist and educator.  Mariu was born in Blenheim on 3 October 1893, the daughter of Alfred Williams and Hinekahukura (née Hughes). She was educated at Hamilton Girls' High School and Canterbury Training College, before studying art at the Elam School of Fine Arts in Auckland. In 1917, she married John Mariu, with whom she had two children. She died in Auckland on 8 December 1978.  Mariu's early work was in the Ashburton School of painting style, but she later developed her own style which combined traditional Māori art with European abstraction. Her work is held in many collections around the world, including the Auckland War Memorial Museum, Te Papa Tongarewa, and the New Zealand National Gallery.

Bingo is a game of probability in which players try to obtain as many correct answers as possible. The game is played with a board of 64 squares divided into nine rows and eight columns. Players place chips or tickets on the squares in front of them, and then attempt to win combinations of matching numbers. Bingo is sometimes called British poker, as it was originally played with the same deck of cards.  Bingo was first recorded in 1675, in the village of Whitechapel in London. It was then called "bing-a-bing", and was a popular game among the working class. In 1876, the Reverend James Simeon Bingham created a set of rules for bingo which are still used today. Bingo became popular in North America during the 1930s, and has since become one of the world's most popular games. There are now over 100 million people playing bingo around the world each week.  Bingo is a simple game which can be enjoyed by anyone. The rules are easy to learn, and there are many variations which can be made to make the game more challenging or interesting. There is also a social aspect to bingo which makes it a great way to spend an evening with friends.

Rashid Rauf (ca. 1981 â€“ 22 November 2013) was a British Muslim activist and imam who co-founded the Islamic Forum Europe (IFE) in 2007.  Rauf served as IFE's director until his death from cancer in 2013. He was a vocal critic of the British government's counter-terrorism policies, and advocated for the implementation of Sharia law in Britain.  Rauf was born in 1981 in London, England to Pakistani parents. He grew up in North London, and attended Whitechapel High School and then the University of Westminster, where he earned a degree in Islamic Studies.  In 2007, Rauf co-founded the Islamic Forum Europe (IFE), an organisation which aimed to promote dialogue between Muslims and non-Muslims. IFE organised events such as interfaith dialogues, lectures on Islam and interfaith relations, and debates on controversial issues such as Sharia law. IFE also published a quarterly magazine, "Islamic Perspectives".  Rauf was a vocal critic of the British government's counter-terrorism policies, and advocated for the implementation of Sharia law in Britain. He was also critical of Western liberalism, saying that it "promotes secularism at the expense of faith". In an interview with "The Guardian", Rauf criticised British Prime Minister David Cameron for his combative stance against extremism, saying that it would only serve to radicalise young Britons.  Rauf died from cancer on 22 November 2013 at the age of 36.

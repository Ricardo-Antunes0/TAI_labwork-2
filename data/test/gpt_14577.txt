The Vozvraschaemyi Apparat (, GRAU index 11F74), also known as VA, was a Soviet spacecraft used to study the atmosphere and space environment. It was the first spacecraft to use an all-metal frame and it was also the first spacecraft to be powered by an ion engine.  The VA spacecraft was launched on October 12, 1965, and it remained in orbit around the Earth for over five years. The VA spacecraft made numerous scientific observations of the Earth's atmosphere and space environment, including the first detailed study of the upper atmosphere. The VA spacecraft also made important measurements of the Van Allen radiation belt.

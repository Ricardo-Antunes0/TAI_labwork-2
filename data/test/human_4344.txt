Plot summary At the beginning of the story, ten birds are on a riverbank trying to figure out a way to cross to the other side. One by one the birds find a way to cross the river using different building materials. The first bird, the one they call "Brilliant", builds some slits and crosses the river. The next bird, the one they call "Quite Advanced", engineers an underwater paddle to get to the other side. As the book goes on one by one they cross the river, each with different names. The last bird to cross the river is the one they call "Needs Improvement." This bird devises a simple plan, to just walk across the bridge to the other side of the river, leaving all the birds astounded.

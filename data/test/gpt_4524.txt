Napoléon-Louis Bonaparte (11 October 1804 – 17 July 1873) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and later ruled as Emperor of the French from 1852 to 1871.  Napoléon was born in Corsica to a relatively modest family from the minor nobility. He became an artillery officer in the French army, fighting in the Peninsular War (1807–1814). He later served as an officer in the Egyptian and Italian campaigns, and was promoted to general in 1841. In 1848, he led a military expedition to Rome which became known as the "Italian Campaign". He became head of the French government in 1849, and then again in 1852 after the death of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte.  In 1858, Napoleon led France against Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War, winning a decisive victory at the Battle of Sedan that effectively ended Prussia's ambitions of hegemony over Europe. In 1870, Napoleon was forced to abdicate after losing the War of the Third Coalition. He died a few months later at the age of 81.

Seal of Approval (foaled 31 March 2009) is an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He is best known for his victory in the 2014 Epsom Derby.  Seal of Approval is a bay horse with a white sock on his left hind foot and a white blaze on his right hind foot bred in Ireland by the Coolmore Stud. He was sent to England to be trained by Gordon Elliott at the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes stable in Newmarket, Suffolk.  Seal of Approval made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 27 April and finished second, beaten just one and a half lengths by the filly Special Tiara. Eleven days later he contested his first Group One race, a Listed race over ten furlongs at Salisbury Racecourse and finished second again, this time beaten three quarters of a length by stablemate Kauto Star.  On 7 June Seal of Approval started the 4/1 second favourite for the Group One Royal Ascot Gold Cup over one mile but was beaten two and a half lengths by the French-trained mare Moonstone. Three weeks later he contested his first major classic, the Epsom Derby over One Mile and One Quarter. Ridden by Richard Hughes he started at odds of 10/1 in a field of twenty-four runners and won "comfortably" by four lengths from Golden Fleece, with Special Tiara third.

The Melbourne–Voyager collision, also known as the Melbourne incident, was a collision between two spacecraft, the Australian-built Melbourne and the American Voyager 1, on 13 February 1996. The collision resulted in the destruction of both spacecraft and the loss of all aboard.  The Voyager 1 probe was launched in 1977 on a 2118-day journey to explore the outer reaches of the Solar System. On 13 February 1996, less than three months after its encounter with Saturn, Voyager 1 crossed paths with Melbourne, a smaller Australian-built spacecraft travelling at a higher speed. The collision destroyed both spacecraft and all their crews.  Although it was not the only such incident in history, the Melbourne–Voyager collision has been widely regarded as one of the most catastrophic due to its high loss of life and technological achievements. The collision also raised questions about the feasibility of using small spacecraft for interstellar exploration.

The Malaysian language (, Jawi: ) or Malaysian Malay (, Jawi: Melayu Malay) is a major language spoken in Malaysia. It is the national language of Malaysia, and the official language of the government of Malaysia. The language is also the lingua franca of Singapore.  Malaysian is a member of the Austronesian family of languages, and is one of the few languages in Southeast Asia not descended from Chinese. It is also the only Malaysian language with a significant number of speakers in Brunei, Indonesia and Thailand. The official name of the language is Melayu Malay.  Like other Austronesian languages, Malaysian is classified as a member of the Southeast Asian branch of the Austronesian language family. The closest relatives of Malaysian are the Sundanese and Javanese languages. There are about fifty million speakers of Malaysian, making it one of the world's most-spoken languages.  Malaysian emerged as a distinct language in the early 15th century, when Muslim traders and missionaries began arriving on the Malacca Peninsula from what is now Indonesia. Prior to this, the only linguistic record of Malaysian was found in Old Malay inscriptions from the 9th century. These inscriptions show that Old Malay had some similarities to modern Malaysian, but was not a cohesive language.  The first written records of Malaysian were made in 1511 by an Arabic trader called Abdullah Shahbandar, who recorded some words and phrases from local people in his journal.

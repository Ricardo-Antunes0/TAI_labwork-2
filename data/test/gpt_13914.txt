Robert Montgomery (1807â€“1855) was an English poet, playwright and novelist. He wrote both light verse and serious poetry, and is best known for his romantic love poetry. His most famous works include The Moon Is Blue and The Wine of Age.  Robert Montgomery was born in London on 3 November 1807, the eldest son of the Reverend George Montgomery, a clergyman in the Church of England who served as the Bishop of London from 1824 to 1855. After attending Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, he began a career in law, but abandoned it in 1829 to become a full-time writer.  His first publication was a volume of poems, Poems (1829). He followed this with two more volumes of poetry, Poems (1830) and Poems (1833), which established him as one of the leading Romantic poets in England. His first play, The Clandestine Marriage (1836), was a great success on stage and won him widespread critical acclaim. His other plays include The Second Mrs Tanqueray (1841), The Heiress (1849), and The Fair Maid of Perth (1852).  Montgomery's novels include The Yeomanry (1838), which tells the story of an impoverished English country gentleman who joins the British Yeomanry cavalry and rises to become a captain; A Summer Love (1845), about a love triangle between an English gentleman, a French girl and an American girl; and The Lost Lady of Pembroke Hall

Shape of Despair is a funeral doom metal band from the United States. Formed in 2005, the band has released two full-length albums, one EP, and four singles.  Shape of Despair was founded in 2005 by guitarist/vocalist Devin Townsend and drummer Joel Stroetzel. The two had met while playing in another band together and decided to start their own project. After practicing for a few months, they recruited bassist JB Leppard and vocalist/guitarist Mike Martin to complete the lineup. The band's original name was Lillith, but they eventually changed it to Shape of Despair after discovering a song by the same name by Norwegian black metal band Dimmu Borgir.  The band's first release was an EP called "The Great Desolation" in 2006. The album was reissued by Metal Blade Records in 2007 with three bonus tracks. In 2007, the band toured North America with labelmates Symphony X and Iced Earth.  The band's debut full-length album, "The Shape of Despair", was released on March 26, 2008 through Metal Blade Records. The album debuted at number 49 on the "Billboard" Top 200 chart, and has since sold over 2,000 copies in the United States. The album was produced by Townsend and David Bottrill (Tool, Dream Theater) at their studio in England. Townsend has said that the album is influenced by bands such as Darkthrone, Carcass, Obituary, and Bathory

MIVEC (Mitsubishi Innovative Valve timing Electronic Control) is a type of electronic control system used in Mitsubishi engines, first introduced on the Lancer Evolution VI. It replaces the traditional engine management system with a single controller that monitors and manages all the engine parameters.  MIVEC was designed to improve fuel economy and emissions by improving combustion and air/fuel mixture efficiency. It also allows for more flexible tuning of engine performance, including modifications to spark timing, fuel injection, and exhaust valve timing. MIVEC has been successful in achieving these goals on a wide variety of engines, including both gasoline and diesel models.

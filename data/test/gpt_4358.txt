A tethered flight test is a type of flight test in which an aerospace vehicle is attached to a ground or airborne support system for the purpose of controlling its flight. The aerospace vehicle is typically tethered to the ground or support system by a cable, but may also be flown using various other techniques.  A tethered flight test allows for more accurate control of the aerospace vehicle than would be possible if it were free to fly. This is especially important when testing aircraft designs that are not yet ready for full flight certification, or when testing aircraft components that must be precisely positioned in order to achieve satisfactory results. In addition, tethered flights can provide valuable information about the aerodynamic capabilities of an aircraft, the stability of an airframe, and the performance of aircraft systems.

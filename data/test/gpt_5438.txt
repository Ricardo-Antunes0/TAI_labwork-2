In telecommunication technology, a Barker code, or Barker code modulation, is a modulation scheme used in wire and radio communication. It is named after American electrical engineer Edwin Barker.  Barker code uses a 5-bit alphabet, with each letter represented by two bits. Each letter is spread out across two octets, with the first octet representing the most significant bit and the second octet representing the least significant bit. Each character can be represented by a sequence of eight bits, which are combined to create the transmitted message.  Barker code is most commonly used in digital subscriber line (DSL) and cable modem service providers to send data over telephone lines. It is also used in satellite communications, point-to-point links, mobile phone networks, and other applications where low bit rate and high reliability are required.

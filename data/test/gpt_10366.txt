Paul Auguste Hariot (1854 – 5 July 1920) was a French historian and archaeologist who specialized in the history of the Israelites.  He was born in Paris to a Protestant family of modest means. He began his studies at the École Pratique des Hautes Études and then went on to study history at the University of Paris, where he obtained his doctorate in 1881.   Hariot spent most of his career teaching at the University of Orléans, where he served as professor of ancient history from 1893 until his death. He also served as president of the French Archaeological Society from 1907 to 1908.  Hariot is best known for his work on the History of the Israelites, which he wrote over a period of nearly 40 years. His book, L'Ancienne Egypte et la Palestine (1892), was one of the first works to introduce archaeological evidence into historical studies. His other major works include La Civilisation du Proche-Orient (1904), La Méditerranée et le monde antique (1909), and Les Religions de l'Antiquité (1913). Hariot was also a renowned philologist and wrote numerous articles on classical and biblical subjects. He was awarded the Légion d'honneur in 1902 and the Grand Prix de Rome in 1913.

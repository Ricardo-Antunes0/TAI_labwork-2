Hotel Marselis or Marselis Hotel - Aarhus is a hotel in Aarhus, Denmark. It is located in the Marselisborg Forests, in the HÃ¸jbjerg district. It overlooks the Bay of Aarhus from a prominent position on the coast. The hotel is owned by the company Helnan Hotels which also operates a hotel in Aalborg. The hotel includes 163 rooms and beyond common amenities also feature conference and meeting rooms. Marselis Hotel is a four star hotel (2016) and is member of the Danish hotel organization Horesta.   Marselis Hotel was the culmination of almost a century of efforts to have a hotel established in the Marselisborg Forests. In 1965 the local master mason Anker Jakobsen bought the half-timbered Frydenlund house which used to be home to the local park ranger. Jakobsen was deeply engaged in the project and demanded that all bricks be handmade rather than factory produced. The hotel was completed in 1967 and operated until 2001 when it was bought by the hotel chain Helnan International Hotels, founded by Enan Galaly. After 2001 the hotel faced a large renovation and expansion in a modern and maritime style.

Malay Singaporeans (, Jawi: ) are a Singaporean ethnic group who are of Malay descent. They numbered around 43,000 people in 2006, the majority of whom reside in the Singaporean state of Johor.  The Malays are the largest ethnic group in Singapore, constituting around 60% of the population. The Malays are divided into three main groups: the Straits-born Malays, who are descendants of the original settlers from southern Malaysia; the Bugis Malays, who are from Sulawesi; and the Javanese Muslims, who trace their ancestry to Java. The Malays form a distinct community within Singapore, with their own language, culture, and traditions.  The Malays in Singapore have played an important role in its history and culture. They have been instrumental in building up Singapore as a prosperous nation and have played a significant role in its political life. The Malays also form a significant section of the labour force in Singapore, and many of them have achieved prominence in various fields of business and industry.

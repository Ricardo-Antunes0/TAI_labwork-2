In crystalline materials, Umklapp scattering (also U-process scattering) is a type of Rayleigh scattering that occurs when an incident wave encounters a crystal surface that is not perpendicular to the wavevector. The scattered waves are parallel to the surface and form an angle with the incident wavevector. This angle is called the umklapp angle and depends on the crystal orientation.

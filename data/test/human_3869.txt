Eternal Law is a 2012 ITV fantasy drama series created  by Ashley Pharoah and Matthew Graham. The show stars Samuel West, Ukweli Roach, Orla Brady, Tobias Menzies and Hattie Morahan. Set in York, it is centred on two angels sent to Earth to assist in court cases. The first episode premiered on 5 January 2012. The show was axed after one series due to low ratings. Plot Mr. Mountjoy (God, spoken of but never seen) sends two wing-bearing angels to Earth to help humans with their problems. Humans cannot see the angels' wings except in exceptional circumstances, like being close to death. Zak Gist (Samuel West) is an experienced angel, 14 billion years old (episode six), who has been to Earth before. Tom Greening (Ukweli Roach) is an angel still learning the ways of humans. It is decided that the pair can best help humans as barristers in York, England. In York they are met by Mrs. Sheringham (Orla Brady), an angel who became mortal to marry Billy, a human, but, was widowed; she arranges offices and accommodation with her at The Belfry. She kept her old pair of wings in a trunk before throwing them into a river during the series. In court they cross paths with a fallen angel, Richard Pembroke, who is also a barrister, usually prosecuting. In episode six, Richard's wings are seen - they are black. Zak also meets Hannah English, a woman with whom he is in love from one of his past visits to Earth, but who does not recognize him.

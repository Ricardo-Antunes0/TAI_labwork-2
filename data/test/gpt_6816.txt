The Agena Target Vehicle (ATV), also known as the Agena Explorer, is a American expendable launch system (ELA) used to launch payloads into low Earth orbit (LEO). The ATV was developed by Boeing in the 1970s as a replacement for its Delta II family of launch vehicles.  The ATV is a two-stage launch vehicle. The first stage, or Launcher 1, is a nine-metric-ton (10.4 ton) solid-fueled rocket equipped with a single Aerojet AJ-26 engine. The second stage, or Launcher 2, is a three-metric-ton (3.7 ton) solid-fueled rocket that uses an Aerojet AJ-36 engine.

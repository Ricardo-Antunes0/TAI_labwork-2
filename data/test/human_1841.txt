"Je te survivrai"  is a 1989 pop song recorded by French singer and former footballer Jean-Pierre François. Written by Didier Barbelivien, it was released first in June 1989 as the first single from his only album Des Nuits (1990), on which it is the ninth and last track. It was a summer hit in France, reaching number two on the singles chart, and has become a popular song throughout years. Background François, who had just experienced a romantic separation, went to the Côte d'Azur where he met famous lyricist Didier Barbelivien in a nightclub; it was said that Barbelivien, impressed by François' athletic physique, would have said to his friend Félix Gray: "You see this guy? I'm going to write him a hit". He thus proposed François to write him a song that would deal with his recent split. The recording of "Je te survivrai" was difficult because François had a slight lisp and a thinner voice than expected, so that Barbelivien first wanted to give up; however, sound engineer Bernard Estardy had the idea to record François with a broken voice, then mixed the song for weeks. At the time, a persistent rumor stated that the song used Barbelivien's voice, later modified in the studio. The success of the single allowed François to record an album, Des Nuits, which was released in 1990 and provided another top ten hit, "Il a neigé sur les lacs".

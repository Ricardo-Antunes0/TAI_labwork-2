Carter Carburetor Company in St. Louis, Missouri, was founded in 1908 by Carter W. Carburetor and his brother-in-law, Willard A. Brown. The company produced carburetors for automobiles and motorcycles. In the early days of aviation, Carter carburetors were used on some early aircraft engines.  The Carter carburetor was a popular product in its day, and was used on a wide variety of vehicles including automobiles, motorcycles, and aircraft engines. The Carter carburetor was a fuel injection system that utilized an intake manifold with several ports that fed air into the carburetor bowl via a needle valve mechanism. The air was then mixed with fuel and ignited to create heat that vaporized the fuel and created engine power.  The Carter carburetor was one of the first fuel injection systems to become popular, and it was used on a wide variety of vehicles. The Carter carburetor is still popular today, and is used on a variety of vehicles including automobiles, motorcycles, and aircraft engines.

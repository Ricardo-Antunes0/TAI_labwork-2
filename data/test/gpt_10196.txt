Gassenhauer nach Hans Neusiedler (1536), commonly known simply as Gassenhauer, is a German composer, violinist and violist.  Gassenhauer was born in 1536 in Eisenach, Thuringia. He studied at the University of Leipzig where he was a student of Georg Muffat and Heinrich Schütz. In 1572 he moved to Augsburg where he became court musician to Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. He died in 1612.  Gassenhauer's music is marked by its rhythmic complexity and virtuosity. He is best known for his six string pieces "Musikalisches Opfer" (Music of Sacrifice), "Orgelbüchlein" (Orgel Book), and "Cantata Domini" (Lord's Cantata).

Gyrinocheilus is the single genus in the family Gyrinocheilidae, comprising two species of fish that inhabit Southeast Asia and parts of the Indian Ocean. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek γυρινός (gurĩos), meaning "wavy", and κεφαλή (kephalē), meaning "head". The specific name, bicolor, refers to the fish's two colors, black on the back and white on the belly.  The Gyrinocheilus genus is distributed throughout Southeast Asia and parts of the Indian Ocean. They are found in both fresh and salt water habitats. They are predators that feed on small fishes and other aquatic invertebrates.  The two species in the genus Gyrinocheilus are the black-bellied gyrinocheilid fish and the white-bellied gyrinocheilid fish. The black-bellied gyrinocheilid fish has a black back and a white belly, while the white-bellied gyrinocheilid fish has a white back and a black belly.

Eva Margareta Steinby FSA (born 21 November 1945) is a Swedish artist who lives and works in London, England. Steinby is recognised for her abstract paintings and sculptures, which often depict everyday objects transformed into strange and enigmatic forms.  Born in Västerås, Sweden, Steinby studied at the Royal College of Art in London, England from 1964 to 1968, where she was influenced by the work of Anthony McCall and Richard Serra. After completing her studies, she worked as an assistant to the sculptor Barbara Hepworth between 1968 and 1970. In 1971, she moved to New York City, where she worked with the painter Sol LeWitt and the architect Philip Johnson. In 1975, she returned to London and has since exhibited her work at numerous galleries around the world.  Steinby was awarded the prestigious Turner Prize in 1992.

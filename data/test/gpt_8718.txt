Sonia Petrovna (name also credited as Petrova and Petrovna; Russian: Софья Петровна, pronounced [ˈsɒfʲa ˈpetrəvnə]) was the last Empress consort of Russia, the second wife of Emperor Alexander III, and mother of his successor, Nicholas II.  Sonia Petrovna was born in 1858 in the town of Nizhny Novgorod, in the Russian Empire. She was the youngest daughter of Count Pyotr Andreyevich Petrov and his wife Ekaterina Andreyevna Mostovskaya. Her siblings were Anna, Vasiliy, Olga and Anastasia. After her father's death in 1884, her mother remarried to Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, and moved with her new family to Saint Petersburg.  In 1895, at the age of thirty-six, Sonia Petrovna became Empress consort of Russia upon her husband's accession to the throne. She brought a contemporary and radical outlook to court life, and reigned alongside her husband as an influential figure within the government. During Alexander's long reign, she played a key role in promoting reform within Russia. She was particularly noted for her work on behalf of women's rights and social welfare. In 1905, she was widowed when Alexander died from a heart attack. Nine months later, her son Nicholas II ascended to the throne

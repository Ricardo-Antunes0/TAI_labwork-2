Skatteskrapan ("The Tax Scraper") is a 26-storey,  building in Stockholm, Sweden. It is located at Götgatan 76 in the district of Södermalm, in a block named Gamen (The Vulture). With an initial height of 81 metres and 25 floors, it was the tallest building in Sweden from its completion in 1959 to 1964 when it was surpassed by the 84 metres tall Dagens Nyheter Tower. The building was designed by architect Paul Hedqvist for the Swedish National Tax Board (hence its name). It served as the office of the Tax Board until 2003, when it was decided under then Mayor of Stockholm Annika Billström that the building be rebuilt internally to turn it into student apartments. Svenska Bostäder took over ownership of the building from its former host Vasakronan on 29 December 2003. In 2008 the building was bought by AP Fastigheter which soon merged with Vasakronan. The building is protected as a cultural landmark by the City of Stockholm, which means it can't be rebuilt externally.

In the study of hierarchical clustering, Dasgupta's objective (Dasgupta, 1971) is an algorithm used to find a partitioning of a data set into clusters.  The Dasgupta's objective algorithm is a partitioning algorithm that uses a criterion to determine the best partitioning of a data set into clusters. The algorithm was developed by P. C. Dasgupta in 1971. The algorithm is based on the concept of mutual information between pairs of objects in a data set. The Dasgupta's objective algorithm uses the Mutual Information between pairs of objects to find the best partitioning of a data set into clusters.

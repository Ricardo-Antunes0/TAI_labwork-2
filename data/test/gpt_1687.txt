The arm贸nico, also known as trilina, is a type of string instrument popular in Spain and Latin America. The name arm贸nico is derived from the Spanish word "arm贸nico", meaning "of the harpsichord". The arm贸nico is a plucked string instrument with six strings, tuned in fifths. It is similar in construction to the vihuela, but has a higher tuning and a wider range.

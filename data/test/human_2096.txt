Darryl & Lori Schroeder Park (formerly known as Cougar Field) is a baseball park in Houston, Texas.  It is the home field of the Houston Cougars baseball team.  Several iterations of the ballpark have existed.  The current stadium holds 5,000 people, and opened for baseball in 1995.  With a 1,500 square foot Daktronics video board, Schroeder Park features the second-largest scoreboard in college baseball. Since its opening, Schroeder Park has hosted several notable college baseball events.  In February 2016, the University of Houston announced that, as a response to a large donation to the baseball program, Cougar Field would be renamed Darryl & Lori Schroeder Park. History Prior to 1961, the Cougars played at Buff Stadium.  The original baseball stadium named Cougar Field was built roughly in the same area as the current one.  Before 1968, it existed where Hofheinz Pavilion is today.  To make room for the then new basketball arena, Cougar Field was moved next door.  This iteration of Cougar Field stayed in the same location until March 29, 1994, when it was demolished in preparation for the establishment of the UH Athletics/Alumni center.  To finish the rest of their season's home games, the Cougars played at Texas A&M University's Olsen Field and crosstown Rice University's Cameron Field.  After a multimillion-dollar donation from Cougar alumnus and San Diego Padres owner John Moores, the current stadium was built throughout the remainder of the year, and had its first game on February 22, 1995.

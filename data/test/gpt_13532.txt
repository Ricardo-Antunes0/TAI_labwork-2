In Israeli law, an outpost (, Ma'ahaz) is a civilian population center or settlement in the West Bank, which was established without the prior military approval of Israel's Central Command. Outposts are considered illegal under international law, and are considered an obstacle to the establishment of a contiguous Palestinian state.   Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are considered illegal under international law, but Israel has defended them as necessary for security purposes. The International Court of Justice ruled in 2004 that Israeli settlements were illegal, but Israel has continued to build new settlements in defiance of this ruling.   As of May 2010, there were 508 Israeli outposts in the West Bank, of which 303 were considered active. The outpost population numbered 9,318 as of that date.

Clara Collet (10 September 1860 – 3 June 1933) was an Italian operatic soprano. She was born in Rome to a family of artists and was educated at the Conservatorio di Santa Cecilia in Rome. In 1883 she made her debut as Octavian in La traviata at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome and quickly established herself as one of the leading opera singers of her time. She was a regular performer at the major opera houses of Europe, appearing in roles from Verdi to Wagner and Massenet. Among her most notable roles were Kundry in Parsifal, Amneris in Aida, and Elisabeth in Tannhäuser. Her last major role was that of Aida's sister Arsinoe in 1898. Collet retired from the stage in 1907 and later lived in retirement in Nice.

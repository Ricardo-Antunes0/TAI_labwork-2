Hudson's Bay Centre is an office and shopping complex in the heart of downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The complex is located on the southwest corner of Bay and Dundas Streets.  The complex was built on the site of the old Eaton's department store, which had been demolished in 1965 to make way for the construction of the Toronto Eaton Centre. The first phase of development, which opened in 1978, included a two-storey shopping mall with 150 stores and a five-screen movie theatre. The second phase, which opened in 1988, added a three-storey office tower and a 12-screen movie theatre. In 2002, the complex was expanded with the addition of a six-storey office tower and a 20-screen movie theatre.  Today, Hudson's Bay Centre encompasses over 1 million square feet (90,000 mÂ²) of retail space, including flagship stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Holt Renfrew as well as national chains such as Zara and H&M. It is also home to several large office buildings including One Canada Square and HSBC's Canadian headquarters.

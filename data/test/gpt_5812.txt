Sphaeria or Sphairia , later called Hiera, is a genus of fungi in the family Marasmiaceae. Species in this genus are parasitic on plants, and produce fruiting bodies that are often mistaken for mushrooms. The genus is widespread and diverse, with about 120 species known.  The fruit bodies of species in this genus are generally convex to flattened and typically measure up to 20 cm across. They can be brightly colored, and have a characteristic veil of fine hairs that covers the surface of the fruit body. The veil is often broken into small pieces or pulled away entirely, revealing the spore-bearing surface beneath. The sterility of many species of this genus is an important tool for plant researchers, as it allows them to isolate specific strains of plant without fear of cross-contamination.  The name Hiera is derived from the Ancient Greek word χεῖρα (khēra), meaning "chamber," and refers to the characteristic veil structure.

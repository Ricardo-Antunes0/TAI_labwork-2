Prescott Farm is a historic preservation of an 18th century farmstead in Johnston, Rhode Island. The farm is home to a working farm, with crops, livestock, and a historic mill. The farmstead includes a barn, smokehouse, dairy, and two tenant houses.  The farm was first settled by the Prescott family in the early 18th century. The original farmhouse was built in 1740 and is one of the oldest surviving structures in Johnston. The property was acquired by the Johnston Historical Society in 1981 and has since been preserved as a historic farmstead.  The property is open to the public for tours and educational programs, and is used as a venue for weddings and other events.

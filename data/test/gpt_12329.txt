The Broadway Kids was a concert group assembled by producer Lou Adler in the early 1960s. The group consisted of a core of young singers who had just started their careers on Broadway, and featured future stars such as Barbra Streisand, Neil Diamond, and Dionne Warwick.  The Broadway Kids toured extensively throughout the early 1960s, performing in major cities around the world. They were often compared to the Beatles, and their concerts were popular with both young and old. The group disbanded in 1968, but their music continues to be played on radio and television worldwide.

Ruby Mountain is a prominent  mountain located in the North Cascades of Washington state. With an elevation of 8,753 feet (2,611 m), it is the highest peak in the North Cascades. The mountain is located within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and is part of the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.  The mountain was first climbed on July 17, 1928 by a party led by A.L. Kincaid and consisted of Charles Wilkinson, Frederick H. West and Ralph H. Anderson. The peak was first named Ruby Mountain after a small red rock near the summit that climbers found while ascending the mountain. In 1931, the peak was renamed Mount Baker after Mount Baker in Oregon which had recently been named after American mountaineer Benjamin L. King. In 1938, the name was changed to Ruby Mountain after the mountain's namesake gemstone, ruby. The name has remained unchanged since then.  The summit of Ruby Mountain offers spectacular views of both the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and Mount Baker to the east. The summit also contains several endangered plant species, including pitcher plants and cushion plants. The mountain is part of a long-standing tradition among mountaineers to leave gear hidden on the summit in order to leave it as unclaimed territory for future climbers.

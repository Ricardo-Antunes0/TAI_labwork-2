The Earldom of Chester (Welsh: Iarllaeth Caer) was a title in the Peerage of England. It was first created in the early 12th century for Ranulf de Gernon, a Norman baron. The title became extinct in 1399 on the death of the fourth earl, but was revived in 1525 for Thomas Audley, who served as Lord Chancellor. The Audley family held the title until it was forfeited by James Butler, 3rd Duke of Ormonde in 1715.  The title was later recreated in 1766 for George Augustus Frederick, Prince of Wales and Duke of Cumberland, son of George III. The dukedom merged with the crown in 1801, and the earldom became extinct on the death of George Augustus in 1827.

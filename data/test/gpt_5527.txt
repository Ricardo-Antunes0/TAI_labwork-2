Alsap Butte is a 7,494-foot-elevation (2,284 meter) butte in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, in the United States. The butte is located in the town of Conway, about 10 miles (16 km) north of the town of North Conway and about 25 miles (40 km) southwest of the town of Mount Washington.  The butte is part of the Presidential Range and lies within the boundaries of the White Mountain National Forest. It is one of the highest points in New Hampshire. The butte is composed mostly of sedimentary rock, with a smaller component of granite.  The butte is named for Alsap Buttes, two adjacent ridges on either side of which it is located. These ridges are also known as Horseshoe Buttes because their shapes are similar to a horseshoe. The first Alsap Butte was named by Colonel John Wesley Powell in 1869 after his guide, Joe Alsap, who died shortly after reaching the summit.

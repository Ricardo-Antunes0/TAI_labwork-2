Caroline Pounds (n√©e Elam) (fl. 1840-1880) was an Irish watercolour artist. She produced studies of plants and birds of New Guinea and Australia. Life There is little known about Caroline Pounds. She was born Caroline Elam and a descendant of Yorkshire Quakers, the daughter of Lt. Joseph Elam (d. 1829). She married Dr James Baker Pounds, Protestant apothecary and entrepreneur, of New Ross, County Wexford (d. 1884). The couple's eldest son, Joseph Elam Pounds, was born in 1838 at Moathill, County Waterford. The family had emigrated to Sydney around 1846, as they appear to have been bankrupted by the Irish Famine. Dr Pounds' obituary stated that he initially worked in Ballarat, Victoria. Having lost a large amount of money on imported mining machinery he intended to sell, he worked as the medical officer at HM Prison Pentridge until 1862. He was then appointed the corner for the Sandhurst (Bendigo) district, retiring in 1877. After this, he and Pounds travelled to places such as Japan to visit their youngest son, Charles J. W. Pfoundes. More recent research into their son Charles, indicates that the couple separated when he was 6 years old in 1846, that he was raised solely by his father and that he emigrated to Australia alone. Most of Pounds' work is undated, but that which is marked 1846. Bocking believes that Pounds did not live in Australia continuously, rather she spent a period of time there in 1846 before returning to Ireland where she died in 1898.

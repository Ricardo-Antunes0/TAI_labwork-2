Tropospheric scatter, also known as troposcatter, is the scattering of short-wavelength radiation by the Earth's atmosphere. The scatter decreases the intensity of the radiation below a certain threshold, which can be an issue for signal transmission in the lower atmosphere.  Tropospheric scatter is caused by several factors, including the size, shape, and density of the atmosphere; its temperature; and the amount of water vapor, dust, and other small particles in the atmosphere. The scatter also depends on the wavelength of radiation being scattered. Short-wavelength radiation, including visible light and infrared radiation, is scattered more than long-wavelength radiation, including radio waves and microwaves.

Sun Microsystems' UltraSPARC T1 microprocessor, known until the introduction of the UltraSPARC T2 in 1995 as the Sun UltraSPARC I, is a high-end microprocessor that was designed and manufactured by Sun Microsystems.  The first Sun UltraSPARC I microprocessor was made available in March 1994. It had a single-issue, four-way superscalar pipeline that ran at a frequency of 100 MHz. The UltraSPARC I's execution unit consisted of two pipelines, each of which could execute two instructions per clock cycle. The UltraSPARC I had 8 KB of data cache and a 16-KB instruction cache. Although the original design called for an on-chip level 2 cache, this was not included in the final product.  The UltraSPARC I was succeeded by the UltraSPARC I+ in 1995. The UltraSPARC I+ had two extra execution pipelines and increased data cache capacity to 64 KB. The original design for the level 2 cache was reintroduced, and it was now 128 KB in size.

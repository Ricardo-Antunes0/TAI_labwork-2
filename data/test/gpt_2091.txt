Queer Appalachia (also known as the Queer Mountain Region) is an unofficial term used to describe the mountainous region of eastern Kentucky, southern West Virginia and northern Tennessee in the United States. The region is home to a large population of LGBT people who self-identify as Appalachian.  The history of Queer Appalachia is often tied to that of the coal industry. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many queer people in Appalachia worked in the coal mines, often in dangerous and hazardous conditions. As a result, many queer Appalachians have a strong connection to the region's mining culture, which has helped to form the region's queer identity.  Despite some progress made in recent years, Queer Appalachia remains a marginalized region. Many queer people in the area face discrimination and exclusion from mainstream society. As a result, many of them have developed their own unique cultures and social networks, which play a major role in shaping Queer Appalachia's identity.

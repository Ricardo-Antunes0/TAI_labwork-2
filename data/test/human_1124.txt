The  is an 11 kilometer long canal built in the Edo period in the city of Kanazawa, Ishikawa Japan. A 8.7 kilometer portion of this canal was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2010. Overview The Tatsumi Canal was completed in 1632 by the 3rd daimyō of Kanazawa Domain, Maeda Toshinori. After the Kanazawa Great Fire of 1631 destroyed the jōkamachi and most of Kanazawa Castle, he ordered the construction of a canal for the purpose of fire protection and to provide water for the Kenrokuen gardens and moats of Kanazawa Castle. Water was diverted at Kamitatsumi upstream of the Sai River, and to the Kodatsuno plateau via a water tunnel of about 4 kilometers and the use of an inverse siphon to bring water against an uphill gradient. The Tatsumi canal proper then extended for 11 kilometers. En route, it was also used for irrigation purposes.

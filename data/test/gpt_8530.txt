White privilege, or white skin privilege, is the unearned advantage enjoyed by people of white skin in some societies, often referred to as racist systems. White privilege can include things like not having to worry about your race being a determining factor in whether you are hired, being seen as more intelligent or competent than people of other races, or not experiencing racism or discrimination.  There is no one answer to the question of whether white privilege exists, as it can vary from person to person and from country to country. Some people who are white may feel that they do not benefit from white privilege, while others may feel that they benefit from it more than others do. The term "white privilege" was first introduced into academic discourse in the late 1980s by sociologists Patricia Hill Collins and Richard Troyna.  There is no single definition of white privilege, but examples of what might be considered to be privileges associated with being white include: not having to worry about your race being a determining factor in whether you are hired; being seen as more intelligent or competent than people of other races; and not experiencing racism or discrimination.

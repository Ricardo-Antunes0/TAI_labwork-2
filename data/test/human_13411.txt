Stephen Huneck (October 8, 1948 in Columbus, Ohio â€“ January 7, 2010 in Littleton, New Hampshire) was an American wood carving artist, furniture maker, painter, and author. Most of his later artwork is composed of carvings of dogs. Huneck credited the change in his artwork to his dogs coming into the hospital and bringing him out of a long coma. The coma was caused by him falling down the stairs of his barn studio and hitting his head. He had to learn to read, walk and write again and changed the focus of his work to dogs...which Steve noted is "God" spelled backwards. Prior to this, a lot of Huneck's work was devoted to social commentary. In addition to carvings, Huneck also wrote several children's books, the main character of which was his black Labrador Retriever, Sally.  Huneck was originally from Sudbury, Massachusetts. Before becoming an artist, Huneck lived for several years at Quarry Hill Creative Center, Rochester, Vermont, where he began to work in wood. He then became an antiques dealer. He was discovered in 1984 when he found a man pulling one of his carvings, an angel, out of the back of Huneck's pick-up truck. The man asked how much he wanted for the angel. Not intending to sell it and believing that the man would not pay such a high price, Huneck told him that he wanted $1,000. The man revealed himself to be an art dealer from Manhattan and paid Huneck the money. Pieces of Huneck's artwork are in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian Institution, the Dog Museum of America and the American Kennel Club.  Huneck received commissions for works from celebrities and politicians, including Sandra Bullock, Dr. Phil McGraw, and US Senator Patrick Leahy. Much of the basswood, cherry, maple and pine he worked with came from his farm.

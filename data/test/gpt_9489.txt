Gu Taiqing (; Pinyin: Gù Tàiqīng; 1799–1872) was a Chinese scholar, educator and philosopher. He played an important role in the revival of Confucianism during the mid-19th century.  Gu Taiqing was born in 1799 in Xinyang, Henan province. He was educated at the prestigious Peking Academy, where he studied under such noted figures as Kang Youwei and Zou Yan. After completing his studies, Gu served as a teacher at the academy before moving to Beijing to take up a position at the National Academy of Military Sciences. It was here that Gu began to make a name for himself as a leading figure in the revival of Confucianism. Much of his work during this time was focused on restoring traditional Confucian values to the academy and promoting education and understanding of Confucian texts amongst the general populace.  Gu died in 1872 at the age of 73. He is traditionally considered to be one of the most significant thinkers in the history of Chinese philosophy, and has been praised for his contributions to both Confucianism and education. Gu's work has had a significant impact on both East and West, and he is still widely recognised as one of China's most eminent intellectuals.

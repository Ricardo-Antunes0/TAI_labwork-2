RNA silencing or RNA interference refers to a type of gene regulation in which the production or activity of a particular gene is inhibited by the presence of specific RNA molecules. These molecules can act as siRNA (small interfering RNA), miRNA (microRNA), or siMIR (mimic microRNA) molecules, and can be produced by either the host cell or the virus itself. RNA silencing is used to control the expression of target genes, and has been found to be involved in a wide range of biological processes, including development, cancer, and immunity.

Celie refuses to comply with Kellard's desires in order to gain the papers. Meanwhile, High Spade McQueen is angered by McTabb and threatens to kill him. McTabb agrees to kill Kellard, although his cowardliness makes him stay close to Celie for protection. When McTabb buys two horses, he is accused of being a horse thief by a posse, until he proves his innocence. McTabb tells Celie he has killed Kellard, when McQueen has actually beaten him to it. Celie recognizes that McTabb is a liar, but she forgives him after he promises never to lie again.

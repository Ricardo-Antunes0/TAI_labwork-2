In operations research, cuckoo search is an optimization technique for finding a best solution to a problem. The name is derived from the cuckoo bird, which is known to lay its eggs in other birds' nests and to watch the chicks hatch and grow before stealing them away.  Cuckoo search is a method of searching for the best possible solution to a problem by first ensuring that no solution is better than a previously found solution, and then searching for new solutions that are better than the current best solution. The cuckoo search algorithm is based on the observation that there may be multiple solutions that are equally good, and that it is possible to find these solutions by repeatedly altering an already found solution until it becomes better.  Cuckoo search can be used in a number of different situations, including optimization problems, network routing problems, and scheduling problems. In optimization problems, cuckoo search can be used to find the best possible solution to a problem by first ensuring that no solution is better than a previously found solution, and then searching for new solutions that are better than the current best solution. In network routing problems, cuckoo search can be used to find the best possible route between two networks. In scheduling problems, cuckoo search can be used to find the best possible time for a task to be completed.

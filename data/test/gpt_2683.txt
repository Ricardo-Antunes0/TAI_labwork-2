WCVF-FM is an FM radio station in the Tampa Bay Area, broadcasting on 107.5 MHz. The station is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. and airs a classic rock format. WCVF-FM's studios are located in Plant City, and its transmitter is located in Riverview.   WCVF-FM signed on the air on October 25, 1976 as WKNW-FM, simulcasting its AM sister station. The station was founded by Wayne and LaDonna Haney, who also ran WKNW-AM. The Haney family sold the station to Clear Channel Communications in 1997. In 2006, Clear Channel changed the format from oldies to country music, as part of a larger effort to move country music away from urban areas and into more rural areas of the country. In 2007, Clear Channel changed the format back to classic rock after a poor ratings performance with country music.

He was the director of the Institute in 2003–2011.  He works in the field of theoretical atomic and molecular physics with a special focus on numerical solutions to integral and differential equations of scattering theory and on numerical analytic continuation methods localizing the poles of scattering quantities related to resonances. Life  Jiří Horáček spent his early life in Nová Paka. His mother Marta Horáčková (née Pátá) was a music teacher. In early  youth he started playing violin. His teacher was a famous music virtuoso Josef Muzika.  Although Jiří Horáček later pursued a different subject, violin has always been an important part of his life and he performs  regularly with a music group Four and a Half or with friends.

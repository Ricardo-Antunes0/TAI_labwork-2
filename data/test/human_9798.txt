With regard to the planning of the Salt Lake Theatre, Church leader Brigham Young was enthusiastic about the project and styled himself as "designer and general dictator of the whole affair" but in fact the exterior was designed by William H. Folsom, architect of the nearby Salt Lake Temple, and the interior by E. L. T. Harrison based on the Drury Lane Theatre in London. Upon completion in 1862 at a cost of $100,000, it was the largest building in Utah. In his dedication speech, Henry Miller stated that the Salt Lake Theatre was “the cathedral in the desert.”

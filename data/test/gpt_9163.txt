Crewe Almshouses or Crewe's Almshouses is a Grade II* listed almshouse in the town of Nantwich, Cheshire, England. The almshouses were built between 1787 and 1789 and are now managed by the National Trust.  The Crewe Almshouses were built between 1787 and 1789 by Thomas Crewe, a wealthy local linen manufacturer, as a home for retired wool workers and their families. They are now managed by the National Trust, and are one of only two Grade II* listed almshouses in Cheshire. The other is the Warrington Almshouses.  The Crewe Almshouses comprise a collection of three buildings: a central block with five wings, each wing containing four lodging rooms. The central block is in neoclassical style, with a pedimented frontispiece and Corinthian pilasters. The almshouses are also notable for their fine plasterwork, including ceiling coffers, cornices and door surrounds.

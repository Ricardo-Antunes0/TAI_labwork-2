Diptericin is a 9 kDa  antimicrobial peptide that specifically targets Gram-positive bacteria. Diptericin is a derivative of the natural peptide dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV). DPPIV inhibitors are being developed for the treatment of respiratory and skin infections.  Diptericin was discovered by scientists at Novartis in 2006. It is being studied for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, such as pneumonia, skin and respiratory infections. Diptericin has been shown to be effective against a variety of strains of bacteria, and it has low toxicity. Diptericin is being developed as a potential drug therapy for Gram-positive bacterial infections.

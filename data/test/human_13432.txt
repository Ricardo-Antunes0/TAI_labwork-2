Shortcake generally refers to a sweet cake or crumbly biscuit in the American sense. Shortcakes, particularly layered with strawberries and whipped cream, are now found world-wide, but generally considered to be North American in origin. Variations between sweet biscuits and something more like a sponge cake may reflect regional preferences. Japanese strawberry cake tends to use a sponge cake base, and is a popular holiday treat in Japan. History The "short" part of the name "shortcake" indicates something crumbly or crispy, generally through the addition of a fat such as butter or lard. The earliest mention of the term shortcake occurred in 1588,  in the second English cookbook to be printed, The Good Huswifes Handmaid for Cookerie in her Kitchen (London, 1588). It describes a cookie or biscuit in the English sense, made of flour, cream, sugar, egg yolk and spices. It was similar to shortbread but less dense and more crunchy and dry than shortbread.

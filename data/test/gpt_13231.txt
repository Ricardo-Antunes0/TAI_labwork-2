Anthony Phelps (born August 25, 1928) is an American biochemist and molecular biologist who is known for his work on the genetic code and protein synthesis.  Anthony Phelps was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on August 25, 1928. He received a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Harvard University in 1950 and a doctorate in biochemistry from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1953. After working for several years as a research associate at the California Institute of Technology, Phelps joined the faculty of Yale University in 1958. He served as chairman of the department of biochemistry at Yale from 1975 to 1978 and as provost of Yale from 1978 to 1984. During that time, he also served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) from 1981 to 1982.  Phelps has made significant contributions to the field of molecular biology. His work on the genetic code has led to a better understanding of how genes are translated into proteins and how proteins function within cells. His work on protein synthesis has provided new insights into how proteins are assembled into biological molecules and how diseases can be caused by alterations in protein synthesis. Phelps has also been involved in research into cancer and immune system disorders. He is a fellow of both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Clinton in 1997.

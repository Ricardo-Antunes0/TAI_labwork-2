Janakinath Bose (Bengali: জানকীনাথ বসু) (also Janaki Nath Bose; 28 May 1860 – 2 December 1934) was an Indian lawyer and advocate, who was the father of Indian independence leader Subhas Chandra Bose. He is also the father of barrister Sarat Chandra Bose. Early life He had descended from the Boses (kulin kayastha) of Mahinagar (South 24 Parganas). The fourth son of Haranath Bose, he was born on 28 May 1860 in village Kodalia, in the present South 24 Parganas district, West Bengal. Janaki Nath was born in Kodalia on 28 May 1860 as the third son of Haranath Bose. The gate of the house still stands bearing this name. Although the Bose family of Mahinagar can traces its lineage back to Gopinath Bose who was given the title Purandar Khan by Sultan Hussain Shah, by the time of his birth it had been reduced to modest means. Janaki Nath passed the Entrance examination in December 1877 from Albert School, Kolkata.

Re-evaluation Counseling (RC) is a peer-based counseling procedure – 'co-counseling' – in which people aim to help each other deal with the effects of emotional hurt. The theory and practice of RC were developed in Seattle in the United States by Harvey Jackins beginning in the 1950s. In the early 1970s, the Re-evaluation Counseling Community was formed, made up of local groups of Co-Counselors in Seattle and beyond. The theory developed to recognize the importance of challenging oppressions such as sexism and racism, and working to eliminate them. RC now teaches co-counseling and holds workshops throughout the world. While membership of the RC Community requires only a commitment to a one-point program of using the co-counseling process, the community has a number of projects that directly tackle the issues of racism, sexism, anti-semitism and the climate emergency. The International Re-evaluation Counseling Community is based in Shoreline, Washington, USA. It was led by Harvey Jackins until his death in 1999. It is currently led by his son Tim Jackins. History  In the early 1950s, Harvey Jackins, a shipyard worker, building maintenance worker and labor organizer, developed Re-evaluation Co-Counseling after observing that a troubled friend made changes in his thinking process as a result of being patiently listened to while he cried and expressed a range of other emotions. Jackins worked with others to develop a method of counseling based on the recollection of psychological and physical traumas or "hurts" accompanied by various types of emotional catharsis. He called these effects "discharge", which he came to believe led to clearer thinking or "re-evaluation".

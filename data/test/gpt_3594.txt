Arthur Schopenhauer ( , ; 22 February 1788 – 1860) was a German philosopher who developed a pessimistic and ascetic view of the world. He is best known for his essays on ethics, aesthetics, and philosophy of religion.  Born in Frankfurt am Main, Schopenhauer studied philosophy at the University of Göttingen and then at the University of Berlin, where he became acquainted with the work of Immanuel Kant. After two years in Heidelberg, he returned to Berlin, where he became a professor in 1819. In 1841 he retired to Weimar, where he died six years later.  Schopenhauer's main philosophical work is The World As Will and Representation (1818), in which he attempted to combine ideas from Kant and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. His writing has been influential on 20th century philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Bertrand Russell, and Martin Heidegger.

The Limes Saxoniae (Latin for "Limit of Saxony") was a frontier defense system of the Roman Empire in the late 1st century AD. Located in what is now eastern Germany and northwestern Poland, it was part of the northern limes.  The Limes Saxoniae was the last line of defense against barbarian invasions before the northern frontiers of the empire. The construction of the Limes Saxoniae began in 107 AD under Emperor Trajan, and was completed by Hadrian in 117 AD. The Limes consisted of a double wall with a ditch on either side, with a total length of about 105 kilometers. The Romans stationed troops at intervals along the wall to monitor and defend it against invasions.  The Limes Saxoniae remains an important historic site, as it is one of the few Roman sites that have been extensively excavated.

Li Yiji (268â€“204 BC) was a Chinese philosopher and politician. He served as a political adviser to Liu Bang, the founding emperor of the Han dynasty. His brother Li Shang, served as a military general under the Han dynasty. Life Li Yiji was from Gaoyang, Chenliu (near present-day Kaifeng, Henan). He joined Liu Bang in around 207 BC when Liu rebelled against the Qin dynasty. Liu Bang's rebel army was preparing to attack the city of Chenliu, when Li Yiji came to Liu's camp and requested to see Liu, identifying himself as a Confucian scholar. Liu Bang disliked scholars and did not want to meet Li Yiji. Li Yiji was furious and he shouted at the sentry, "You go in and tell the Duke of Pei (Liu Bang) that I'm a drinker from Gaoyang, not a scholar!" Liu Bang was pleased when he heard that a drinker wanted to meet him and he immediately prepared a feast to welcome Li Yiji.

Philippe Petit (; born 13 August 1949) is a French high-wire artist, performer and filmmaker. He is the only person to have ever performed a tightrope walk across the top of the World Trade Center, a feat which he accomplished on 4 July 1974.  Petit was born in Rouen, France, to a family of circus performers. At the age of 16 he began to train as a high-wire artist, and by the early 1970s he was one of the world's leading performers. On 4 July 1974, Petit walked a tightrope between the towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, a feat which has since been described as an "audacious stunt". Following his achievement, Petit toured worldwide and made several films. In 1984, he was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident, and retired from performing. He later resumed making films and directed several successful projects. Petit was married twice and has two children. He is currently married to actress Catherine Deneuve.

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a rare genetic disorder that causes a deficiency in the production of the protein X-linked agammaglobulins. This protein is responsible for the assembly and function of the immune system's memory cells, known as B cells. As a result, people with XLA are prone to infections and other illnesses, as their immune system is not able to fight off infections as effectively as it should.  XLA is caused by a mutation in one of the X-linked genes. The most common form of XLA is caused by a mutation in the MHC class I gene, which codes for the protein X-linked agammaglobulins. Other forms of XLA are also caused by mutations in other X-linked genes.  Most people with XLA develop symptoms during infancy or early childhood. Symptoms may include recurrent infections, poor response to vaccines, and a decreased ability to fight off infections. As XLA progresses, it can lead to serious health problems, including severe immunodeficiency and death. There is currently no cure for XLA, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications.

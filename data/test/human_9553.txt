An amalgamated hromada or amalgamated territorial community , also known as a united territorial community, was a special unit of administrative division in Ukraine from 2015 to 2020. First created in 2015, amalgamated hromadas were formed through the voluntary merger of preexisting hromadas, a form of third-level administrative unit including cities, villages, urban-type settlements, and rural settlements, to form a new enlarged administrative unit. On 6 March 2020 Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal stated that (at the time) 1,045 amalgamated hromadas had been established and that 350 more had to be created. As of 2020 the amalgamated hromadas already took over most tasks of the raions (education, healthcare, sport facilities, culture, and social welfare). On 12 June 2020 the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine established the basic level of administrative division of Ukraine covering its whole territory except for Crimea. All previously established amalgamated hromadas, as well as preexisting hromadas, were subsumed by new units called simply hromadas or territorial communities .

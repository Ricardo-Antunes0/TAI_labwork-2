Madinat al-Baath , also known as City of Baath , is a city in central Syria, administratively part of the Homs Governorate. According to the 2004 census, the population of the city was 126,000.   The city of Baath was founded by Hafez al-Assad in 1966 as the capital of the newly created Alawite State. The city served as Assad's home town until he moved to Damascus in 2000. Assad's two sons, Bashar al-Assad and Maher al-Assad, were also born in Baath.   Madinat al-Baath is best known as the birthplace of Bashar al-Assad, who succeeded his father as President of Syria in 2000. However, Madinat al-Baath also houses several other important government institutions, including the Presidential Palace and Military Intelligence headquarters.

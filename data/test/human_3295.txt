"The Cure" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Lady Gaga. She co-wrote the song with DJ White Shadow, Nick Monson, Lukas Nelson, and Mark Nilan; Detroit City, Gaga, and Monson produced the song. The song originated from a positive vibe between the collaborators, created as a response to atrocities happening around the world. It was developed in Los Angeles, California, where Gaga and her team were working on some music before the singer started filming the 2018 remake of A Star Is Born. Consisting of finger snaps and an electronic pop beat, "The Cure" is composed around an R&B sound. Lyrically, the song talks about the healing effects of love, with the singer advocating herself as the one administering 'the cure'. The song was released as a standalone single by Interscope Records on April 16, 2017, after Gaga performed it live at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, where she was a main headliner. Gaga later included it on the setlist of the Joanne World Tour (2017â€“2018). Critics analysed the sudden release of the track, finding it to be a departure from the singer's previous releases, and wrote about the anthemic nature of the composition. Commercially, "The Cure" reached the top 10 of the record charts in Australia, Hungary, Lebanon, Scotland, Slovakia and Venezuela, and the digital charts of Finland, Greece, and combined-Europe, as well as the top 20 in the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, Latvia, and Malaysia.

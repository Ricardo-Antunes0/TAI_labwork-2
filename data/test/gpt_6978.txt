Expo, for three performers with shortwave radio transmitters, is a work that uses a variety of sound sources, including radio broadcasts, recorded music, and environmental effects. It was composed over a period of about two years beginning in 1976.  Expo began as a commission by the Swiss television network SRF for an hour-long performance to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the International Radio Conference in Montreux. The work was completed in 1978, but was not premiered until 2003, by the Cologne Musik Festival. The Cologne performance was given an extensive reworking for its DVD release in 2009.  The work is divided into four sections, each lasting around twenty minutes. The first section, "Conference", introduces the sounds of radio broadcasts and recorded music from around the world. The second section, "Distance", features natural and man-made sound effects from different parts of the world. The third section, "Medium", features sounds created by Expo's performers using shortwave radios and other electronic equipment. The fourth and final section, "Close", features a collage of sounds created by Expo's performers during the course of the preceding three sections.  Expo has been described as an "ambient sonic landscape", containing elements of musicology, ecology, and technology. It has been influential on subsequent experimental sound works.

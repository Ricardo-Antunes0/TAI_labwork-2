(, The Work of the People) was the first francophone newspaper published by the Moroccan Nationalist Movement in the area under the control of the French Protectorate in Morocco. As the French authorities would not allow a nationalist publication in Arabic, it was published in French. Its founder and editor was Muhammad Ibn al-Hassan al-Wazzaani. Its first issue was published in Fes on August 4, 1933, four months before the first Throne Day, which the newspaper promoted. It was edited by Khadija Diouri, wife of the nationalist leader . History  Muhammad Ibn al-Hassan al-Wazzaani proposed the idea of publishing this newspaper to members of az-Zawiya (, from zawiya), the leadership of the Covert Nationalist Organization . Most members—particularly those who were associated with al-Qarawiyiin University and whom the aristocrats that funded the Moroccan Nationalist Movement held in high esteem—disagreed with the idea, objecting to the use of the French language. They believed it was necessary to speak to the people in their own language to inform them and mobilize them around the nationalist cause.

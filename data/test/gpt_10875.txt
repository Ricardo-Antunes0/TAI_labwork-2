An oil refinery or petroleum refinery is a plant used to refine crude oil into various types of fuels and chemicals. Refineries can be found on both coasts of the United States, in many parts of the world, and in both large and small sizes.  Oil refineries are typically composed of three main sections: the crude-oil-processing section, the chemical-processing section, and the product-distribution section. Crude oil is transported into the refinery via pipelines from wellheads. The process of refining crude oil into different types of fuels and chemicals involves a number of stages that are divided into units known as departments. Units may be dedicated to specific processes, such as distillation, fractionation, or purification.  The largest refineries are often located in coastal areas because of their ability to process large quantities of oil. Smaller refineries are commonly found in rural areas or suburbs. Many refineries are operated by multinational companies.

ANNE is a 2014 play dramatising the story of Jewish diarist Anne Frank's period in hiding in the Secret Annex in Amsterdam during the Second World War. The play was the first major new adaptation of Frank's diary since the 1955 play, and was both authorised and initiated by the Anne Frank Foundation in Basel, the organisation set up by Frank's father Otto Frank to preserve his daughter's legacy and work. As such, Anne was the first adaptation allowed to quote literal passages from the diary. After a near two-year run in the Netherlands, the play closed in 2016, and had production runs in Germany and Israel. The play also formed the basis for the first German film adaptation of the diary. Synopsis  ANNE begins with a framing narrative set in Paris some years after the end of the Second World War. A girl in her early twenties, a student at a prestigious Parisian university, meets with friends and fellow students in a Paris restaurant. There, she runs into Dutch emigr√© Peter Schiff, who, like herself, has survived the war and has since established a publishing business in Paris. The girl reveals herself to be Anne Frank, a childhood friend of Schiff's from Amsterdam. She tells him her story, in chronological order, of the time between June 1942 and August 1944. Anne Frank subsequently frequently steps into and out of the narrative and back into the frame story to talk to Schiff, who remains part of the play as a confidante of Anne's.

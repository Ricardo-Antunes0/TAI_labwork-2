Arizona Territory, colloquially referred to as Confederate Arizona, was a U.S. territory that existed from 1863 until 1912. It was created during the American Civil War as part of the New Mexico Territory and admitted to the Union as the 48th state on February 14, 1912. The territory encompassed present-day Arizona, Nevada, and parts of Utah and Colorado.  Confederate Arizona was a key stronghold for the Confederacy during the American Civil War. The territory was home to a significant number of Confederate soldiers and officials, as well as a large supply of munitions and materiel. Confederate Arizona also played an important role in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the war, serving as a base of operations for several Confederate campaigns in the west. After the war, Confederate Arizona was effectively abandoned by the Confederate government and fell into disarray. The territory was eventually reincorporated into the United States as part of Arizona Territory in 1912.

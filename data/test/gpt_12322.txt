Education in Niger, as in other nations in West and Central Africa, is compulsory from the ages of 6 to 16 years. Primary education is compulsory for all children in Niger, but there are no secondary schools. There are, however, a number of "collèges" (secondary schools), which offer a three-year program leading to the baccalauréat. The University of Niamey was founded in 1965.  Niger's educational system has been criticized for its low quality and lack of resources. The country has only about one-third the number of teachers required to meet its population's needs, and the literacy rate is only about 60%. In recent years, Niger has made efforts to improve its educational system by establishing new schools and hiring more teachers. The government also sponsors scholarships for students to attend university in other countries.

Smith Falls, at 63 feet (19 m), is the highest waterfall in the state of Nebraska and the centerpiece of Smith Falls State Park. The state park and falls are located  east-north east of Valentine and 3 miles south west of Sparks, on the south side of the Niobrara River. Access to the falls is via a footbridge across the river from the north side of the park. History First known as Arikaree Falls, the waterfall bears the name of Orrin B. Smith, a pioneer in the Seven Creeks area (1885 State Census). His step-son, Frederick Smith will later file for a homestead claim 5 Sept. 1889 on the south side of the river in Section 30. The site was subsequently owned by Fred Krzyzanowski, who purchased it in 1941, adding a picnic area and campground to capitalize on its popularity among tourists. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission established the  Smith Falls State Park through a lease agreement with Krzyzanowski family in 1992. A new 25-year lease was signed in 2018. Footbridge In 1996, the historic Verdigre bridge was moved to the park and reconfigured as a footbridge spanning the Niobrara River. The bridge had been previously located at the mouth of Verdigre Creek, then had been moved to carry traffic on Highway 14 in the village of Verdigre, before being dismantled in 1991, then reassembled as a restored 160-foot-long iron truss span at the park in 1996.

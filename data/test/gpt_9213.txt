The South Mowich Glacier is a glacier located in the Mount Cook region of the Southern Alps in New Zealand. The glacier is named after South Mowich Lake, which was named in 1884 by J.M.D. Barrow after Captain George Mowich, a Wellington merchant who had explored the area.  The South Mowich Glacier is one of the largest and most active glaciers in the Mount Cook region, with a length of about 12 km and a total area of about 4 square kilometers. The glacier has been retreating since the early 20th century, and is now only about 4 km long and 0.8 square kilometers in area. It is still growing slowly, however, and may reach its current extent within the next few decades.  The South Mowich Glacier is drained by three tributaries: the Tasman River (which flows into Lake Wakatipu), the South Mowich River, and the Stuart River. The glacier forms part of the boundary between the Canterbury region and Nelson region, and its meltwater contributes to Lake Wakatipu and other reservoirs in these regions.

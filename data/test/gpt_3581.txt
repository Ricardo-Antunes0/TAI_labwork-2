He graduated from Harvard University in 1942 with a degree in electrical engineering, and later received a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley.  Loeb began his academic career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he worked on microwave technology and helped to develop the first operational laser. He then moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he continued his work on lasers and developed techniques that allowed them to be used more effectively.  In 1967, Loeb was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his work on lasers. The citation read: "For his fundamental work on the development of laser technology, which has led to great improvements in precision measurements and has made possible many applications in industry and science."  Loeb died on May 21, 2003, at the age of 86.

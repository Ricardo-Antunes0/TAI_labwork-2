The open-source-software movement is a movement that encourages the sharing of source code for software projects. This sharing allows others to inspect the code, make changes if they wish, and distribute their modifications under the same license as the original software. The open-source-software movement is different from traditional software development in several ways. First, the source code for most open-source software is publicly available. Second, open-source software is developed in a collaborative environment. Finally, open-source software is often developed for free, rather than for profit.

Østhorn (until 1939 Korsvoll) is a station on the Sognsvann Line (line 5) of the Oslo Metro in Norway. It is located  from Stortinget station between Tåsen and Holstein stations. As one of the original stations on the line, Østhorn was opened on 10 October 1934. Nordberg was formerly the next northbound station, but it was closed in 1992, when the Sognsvann Line was upgraded to metro standard. Østhorn is located near a hill named Havnabakken, where local residents toboggan at winter's time. History Korsvoll station opened on 10 October 1934, when Akersbanerne had finished the Songsvann Line from Majorstuen to Sognsvann station. The line was double-tracked from Majorstuen to Korsvoll, and single-tracked from there to Sognsvann. In 1939, the section Korsvoll–Sognsvann was upgraded to double tracks, and the station Korsvoll had its name changed to Østhorn. The name "Østhorn" owes its origins to a crag by the same name that was demolished during the construction of the Sognsvann Line. The station is now positioned inside the remains of the crag, with a metal nest put up to prevent any crumbling of the surrounding crag.

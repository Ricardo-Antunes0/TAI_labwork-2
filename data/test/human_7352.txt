Alspach's conjecture is a mathematical theorem that characterizes the disjoint cycle covers of complete graphs with prescribed cycle lengths. It is named after Brian Alspach, who posed it as a research problem in 1981. A proof was published by . Formulation In this context, a disjoint cycle cover is a set of simple cycles, no two of which use the same edge, that include all of the edges of a graph. For a disjoint cycle cover to exist, it is necessary for every vertex to have even degree, because the degree of each vertex is two times the number of cycles that include that vertex, an even number. And for the cycles in a disjoint cycle cover to have a given collection of lengths, it is also necessary for the sum of the given cycle lengths to equal the total number of edges in the given graph. Alspach conjectured that, for complete graphs, these two necessary conditions are also sufficient: if  is odd (so that the degrees are even) and a given list of cycle lengths (all at most ) adds to  (the number of edges in the complete graph) then the complete graph  can always be decomposed into cycles of the given length. It is this statement that Bryant, Horsley, and Pettersson proved.

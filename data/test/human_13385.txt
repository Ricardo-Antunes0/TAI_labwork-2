Elizabeth Maud Hoffman, née Morgan, also known as Aunty Liz or Yarmauk, (10 March 1927 – 6 April 2009) was an Australian Indigenous rights activist and public servant. She co-founded the first Indigenous Woman's Refuge in Australia, named "The Elizabeth Hoffman House" in her honour. She was one of 250 women included in the Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2001 and received the inaugural NAIDOC Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006. Life  Elizabeth Maud Morgan was born on 10 March 1927 in Cummeragunja, an Aboriginal reserve in New South Wales. She was the second child of Michael Stafford Morgan and Maud Miriam Morgan (née Ross). Morgan's mother died when she was eleven, shortly after she had been removed from the family sent to live at the station hospital, where she worked as a domestic servant. In 1939, Morgan experienced the Cummeragunja walk-off, a protest by Aboriginal people against restrictive practices at the reserve, which shaped her further determination to fight for Aboriginal people's rights.

Separatism is the advocacy of cultural, ethnic, or linguistic separation from the majority culture or language group in a given area.  Separatism can take many forms, including political separatism, religious separatism, and social separatism. It is often associated with nationalisms and is seen as a precursor to full-blown secessionism.  There are several reasons why people might desire a separation from the majority culture or language group. Some separatists may feel that their culture or language is being oppressed by the dominant culture or language group, while others may believe that their own culture or language is superior to those of the majority.  There is no one definition of separatism, and its usage varies across time and place. In some cases, separatists may advocate for complete separation from the majority culture, while in others they may only seek limited separations, such as in the case of linguistic separatists who want to preserve their own language but not necessarily break away from the larger society.

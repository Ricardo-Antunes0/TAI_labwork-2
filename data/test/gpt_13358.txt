Similar braille conventions are used for three other languages of India: Tamil Braille, Kannada Braille, and Telugu Braille.  Devanagari Braille is the braille alphabet of the Indian language Devanagari. It is based on the 1875 British convention, but with a few modifications.  There are 36 letters in Devanagari Braille. Each letter is represented by a unique symbol, called a Devanagari diacritic. The 26 consonants and 6 vowels of the Indian language are represented by the 26 letters of the braille alphabet, along with 4 special letters known as matras (“mothers”).  To write Devanagari Braille, you first need to learn the 26 letters of the braille alphabet. Then you can use the Devanagari diacritic marks to represent each letter. For example, to write the letter “a” in Devanagari Braille, you would use the diacritic mark called an akshar (अक्षा).

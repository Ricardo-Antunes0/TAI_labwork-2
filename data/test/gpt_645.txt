The Forts of Texas include a number of forts and military installations built by the United States Army, Navy, and Marines in the state of Texas during the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. The forts were built to protect American interests in Texas during times of war and to protect the state's burgeoning economy.  Today, the Forts of Texas are a popular tourist destination, and many of the installations are open to the public. The forts are also used by the United States military for training purposes.

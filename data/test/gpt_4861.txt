Transgender Dysphoria Blues is the sixth studio album by Canadian musician Jeff Buckley. It was released on September 24, 1995, by Columbia Records. The album's title is taken from a line in the song "So What" (from Buckley's previous album Grace): "And I can't escape the feeling that I'm stuck in a transgender dysphoria blues."  The album was recorded in 1994 at the Sunset Sound studios in Hollywood, California, and produced by David Kahne. It is considered to be Buckley's most experimental and musically daring record, featuring an eclectic mix of styles that range from acoustic ballads to psychedelic rock. The album has been noted for its use of unusual time signatures and unusual chord progressions.  Transgender Dysphoria Blues received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised its experimental nature and praised Buckley's vocals and songwriting. The album has sold over two million copies worldwide.

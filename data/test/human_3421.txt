Martin Kreuzer (born 15 July 1962 in Ihrlerstein) is a German mathematics professor and chess player who holds the chess titles of International Correspondence Chess Grandmaster and FIDE Master. Kreuzer did his graduate studies in mathematics at the University of Regensburg, located on the Danube River in Bavaria. After spending one year in the United States as a foreign exchange student at Brandeis University in Boston, he finished his diploma in Mathematics in Regensburg in 1986. Next came a post-doctoral fellowship at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, from 1989 to 1991, working in algebraic geometry with Professor Anthony Geramita. He then returned to Germany, worked as a scientific assistant at the University of Regensburg and gained his habilitation in Mathematics in 1997. After substituting for the chair of algebraic geometry at the University of Bayreuth in 2000-2001 and for the chair of algebra at Technical University of Dortmund from 2002 to 2007, he moved to Passau where he holds the chair of symbolic computation at the University of Passau. His main research interests are computer algebra, cryptography, computational commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and their industrial applications.

David Walter Jourdan (born December 5, 1954) is a Canadian-American physicist who has made significant contributions to the understanding of high-energy particle physics and the physics of the universe at large.  Jourdan was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He received his B.Sc. in Physics from McGill University in 1976 and his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1981, where he worked with Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne. From 1981 until 1988 he was a postdoctoral fellow at the California Institute of Technology, where he worked with John Wheeler and Roger Penrose.  Jourdan is currently a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he has been since 1988. He was also a visiting professor at the University of Oxford from 2003 to 2004 and at the University of Cambridge from 2007 to 2008. He is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Jourdan's research focuses on high-energy particle physics, including studies of the collisions that create quarks and gluons, as well as the large-scale structure of the universe. He has also made contributions to theories concerning quantum gravity and black holes. His work has been published in peer-reviewed journals such as "Nature", "Science", "Nature Physics", "Physics Letters B", and "The Astrophysical Journal".  Jourdan has been awarded numerous awards for his work, including the Dirac Medal (1993), the

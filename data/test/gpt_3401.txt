Siward Barn  was an 11th-century English castle, located in the village of Blythburgh in Northumberland. It was captured by the Scots in 1093, but recaptured by Henry I of England a year later. The castle was destroyed by the Scots again in 1174.  Built by Siward, Earl of Northumbria in the late eleventh century on the site of an earlier settlement, the castle was originally a motte and bailey type structure. Its strategic location on a narrow ridge overlooking the River Blyth made it an important stronghold against Scottish raids. In 1093, it was captured by the Scots under Kenneth III, but was recaptured a year later by Henry I. In 1174, it was destroyed by the Scots under William I.  The remains of Siward Barn are now a Scheduled Ancient Monument and are open to visitors.

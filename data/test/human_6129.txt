Hans Borchsenius (September 19, 1832 – April 20, 1908) was an American politician and newspaperman. Biography Hans Theodor Sophus Borchsenius was born at Næstved in Zealand, Denmark. His parents Carl Wilhelm Borchsenius (1803–1858) and Elisabeth Dorothea  (Arneson) Borchsenius (1804–1839) never came to the United States. His father worked in the mercantile business in Denmark. Borchsenius received his educational training at the Nestved high school and academy. In 1856, he sailed for the US arriving in July at Madison, Wisconsin. In Denmark, he had been in the same business as his father, but in the US, he struggled with the new language. For several months he ran the mail stage between Madison and Portage. He felt that the best means of accomplishing his object was to learn a trade, so he served an apprenticeship at the Norwegian language newspaper The Norwegian American (Den Norske Amerikaner), and soon afterward was able to purchase controlling interest in it, changing its name to the North Star (Nordstjernen). He maintained control of the newspaper until 1860, when it was absorbed by the Norwegian language Emigranten which was published by Carl Fredrik Solberg (1833–1924). Through his publication, he became interested in politics and in 1858 was the candidate of the Democratic Party for county clerk, being defeated by a small majority. General Lucius Fairchild and Wisconsin Associate Justice Silas U. Pinney were on the same ticket and were also defeated.

Between the late 11th century and 1844, Shropshire was a county in the south west of England. It is now divided between the Welsh counties of Bridgend and Montgomery and the English county of Herefordshire. The metropolitan county of Shropshire covers a smaller area than either of the other two counties.  The county town, Shropshire, is also the largest town in the county. Other major towns include Telford, Wellington, and Oswestry. The county is rural with many hills and small villages and has a population of around 615,000. The economy is based on agriculture, manufacturing, service industries, and tourism.  The name Shropshire is derived from the Old English word scirp, meaning "a piece of wood", and shire, meaning "a county". The name may have been derived from the Anglo-Saxon word for "a short person", or alternatively from the Old Norse word for "a long person".

Francis Kramarz (born March 8, 1958) is an American author and journalist, who has written about crime fiction, mystery, and suspense for more than two decades. He is the author of the Lincoln Rhyme novels, which are set in New York City and follow the detective's investigations into crimes.   Kramarz was born in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York City, to Polish-Jewish parents who had immigrated to the United States from Łódź in the early 1930s. After attending college at Fordham University in Bronx, he worked as a reporter for The New York Times. Kramarz's first book, a novel set in the fictional Midtown West section of Manhattan, was published in 1991. The book was well-received by critics and won a Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America.   The Lincoln Rhyme novels are set in New York City and follow the detective's investigations into crimes. They were published between 1993 and 2006, with a gap between 2006 and 2010 due to Kramarz's battle with leukemia. The novels have been praised for their complex plotting and characterization, as well as their depiction of contemporary urban life.

The Arbuthnot Bank crash led to the failure of Arbuthnot Bank, a Scottish bank, on 12 January 1827. The crash was the largest financial disaster in British history at the time, and caused a public outcry.  The bank was founded in 1797 by John Arbuthnot and operated initially as a private bank. In 1824, it became a joint-stock company and began to offer loans to businesses and consumers. In 1827, the bank became insolvent due to bad investments in property. This led to a collapse of the Scottish banking system and a general economic depression in Scotland.

Carl Crow (1884–1945) was a Highland, Missouri-born newspaperman, businessman, and author who managed several newspapers and then opened the first Western advertising agency in Shanghai, China. He ran the agency for 19 years, creating calendar advertisements and the so-called sexy China Girl poster. He was also the founding editor of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury. With A.R. Burt and J.B. Powell, Crow published the bilingual Biographies of Prominent Chinese (c. 1925). In the 1930s and 1940s, Crow wrote 13 books, including the explanation of his Confucianism, Master Kung: The Story of Confucius (1937); the anecdotal The Chinese are Like That (1938), titled My Friends the Chinese in England; and his most popular book, 400 Million Customers (1937). The latter won one of the early National Book Awards: the Most Original Book of 1937, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association. 400 Million Customers has been reprinted at least twice in the new millennium.

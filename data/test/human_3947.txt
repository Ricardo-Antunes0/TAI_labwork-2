Toki (sometimes Toki PDX or Toki Restaurant) is a Korean restaurant in Portland, Oregon. Description  Toki is a Korean restaurant in downtown Portland, "spun off" from Han Oak and specializing in bao bun burgers and "snacky" brunch specials. The menu is an expanded version of Han Oak's and includes bibimbap, bulgogi, dumplings, gimbap, Korean fried chicken, noodles, and a steamed bao burger. There are three varieties of Korean fried chicken: Korean-style hot chili oil, sweet garlic soy glaze, and Han Oak's "essence of instant ramen" seasoning blend intended to taste like instant noodle flavor packets. According to Willamette Week, the Gim-bap Supreme "takes its inspiration from both Taco Bell and the TikTok "wrap" trend, in which a tortilla is partially cut into four quadrants, topped with four different ingredients, folded into layers, and griddled". The Buldak-ra-Bboki has been described as a "creative mashup" of buldak and tteokbokki. The brunch menu has doughnuts and breakfast sandwiches, including a bao bun with everything bagel seasoning, koji-cured pork belly or a sausage patty, egg, and cheese. Dalgona coffee is also served.

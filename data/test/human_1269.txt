The "Ghost Town" of Varosha can be clearly viewed from the roof of the Cultural Centre, as can the craters from shells fired during the invasion in the field opposite. The village has agricultural land around it, and is one of the "Kokkinochoria" (red villages) so called from the red soil. Potatoes are widely grown but Deryneia is famous for its strawberries and holds a biennial strawberry festival at the football ground of Anagennisi Deryneia on the Dherynia to Sotira road.

The Spemann-Mangold organizer is a group of cells that are responsible for the induction of the neural tissues during development in amphibian embryos. First described in 1924 by Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold, the introduction of the organizer provided evidence that the fate of cells can be influenced by factors from other cell populations. This discovery significantly impacted the world of developmental biology and fundamentally changed the understanding of early development. Discovery  The Spemann-Mangold organizer was first described in 1924 by Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold. Prior to its discovery, it had been hypothesized by multiple groups that there exists a portion of the developing embryo that serves as an "organization center". In 1918 and 1921, Hans Spemann showed that transplanting presumptive epidermis into the area of presumptive neural tissue would change the fate of the transplanted cells to that of their new destination, and likewise when he transplanted presumptive neural tissue to where the presumptive epidermis was forming. Spemann also showed that by transplanting a piece from the upper blastopore lip into an area of presumptive epidermis, a secondary embryonic primordium formed, including a secondary neural tube, notochord and somites. Additionally, splitting the embryo in half and rotating the animal pole in respect to the vegetal pole resulted in determination spreading from the lower vegetal pole, where the upper blastopore lip was located, to the upper animal half. He also fused together two identical halves from different embryos and observed formation of the neural plate. This work provided the initial evidence to support the notion that there existed some “organization center” that was determined prior to the other embryonic tissue and influenced the determination of surrounding cells.

Digger is an American pop punk band from Pennsylvania, signed to Hopeless Records. History Digger formed in the Lehigh Valley in the mid-1990s and signed to Hopeless Records in 1996. Upon the event of Digger's live recording being played on WMUH the word of the band spread quickly, which led to the band's sign to Hopeless Records. The band released their first LP, Powerbait, and toured until the band came back to the studio to record The Promise of an Uncertain Future.  The band became a three piece in this era, and launched a world tour. Then Monte Carlo was released as a follow up. Not very long afterward, Digger released the Trainwreck EP.  Then after another member change, Digger released what would be their last full album, Keystone.   The departure of the group's bassist and guitarist resulted in their canceling their tour to support the album. After replacing the members, the group continued touring and recording up until the summer of 2004, when they disbanded.

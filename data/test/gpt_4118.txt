Ann Spence Black (1861 - 1947) was an American journalist and activist. She was a founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and served as its first president from 1911 to 1912. She also served as the organization's general secretary from 1914 to 1944.  Black was born in 1861 in Beaufort, South Carolina, one of twelve children of James and Elizabeth (Smith) Black. After completing her elementary education, Black worked as a domestic servant before moving to New York City in 1884 to work as a seamstress.   In 1895, Black founded the African American newspaper "The Independent", which she edited until 1902. In 1902, she became the first woman to be hired as a full-time editorial writer by a white newspaper, the "New York Evening Post". During her time at the "Post", Black wrote articles critical of lynching and segregation, and her writing helped to foster public awareness of racism and sexism within American society.   In 1910, Black helped organize the NAACP, serving as its first president until 1912. During her tenure as president, Black advocated for civil rights for black Americans and worked to build relationships with other civil rights organizations. In 1914, she became the general secretary of the NAACP, a position she held until 1944.   Black died in 1947 at the age of 88. She was posthumously awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by Simmons College in 1949.

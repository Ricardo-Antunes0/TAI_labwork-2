Hung Hei-gun or Hong Xiguan (1745â€”1825) was a military general of the Qing dynasty. Hung was born in 1745 in the Guangdong province of southern China, during the War of the Austrian Succession. He joined the Qing Army in 1768 and rose through the ranks to become a general in 1792.   During the Sino-French War (1894-1895), Hung was given command of the Qing Army's Eighth Military District. He successfully repelled a French invasion of northern Vietnam, and his victory earned him promotion to the rank of generalissimo. In 1898, he was appointed commander in chief of all Qing armies in Southeast Asia. He died in 1825.

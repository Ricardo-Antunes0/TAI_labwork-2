The Uinta Basin Rail project is a proposed  rail line to connect the shale oil rich Uinta Basin region of eastern Utah to the national rail network. Numerous proposals have been made, some as far back as 1902, that are still under consideration. The current effort is a public-private partnership between a coalition of 7 counties in Utah, the Rio Grande Pacific Corporation and Drexel Hamilton Infrastructure Partners. If the rail line is built it will be the first major greenfield rail line built in the United States since the line to the Powder River Basin was built in the 1970s. Construction for this line is projected to begin in 2021; however, environmental groups have filed lawsuits to try to stop construction. Past efforts The Uinta basin's oil and mineral resources have long attracted the attention of railroad builders. The Denver and Salt Lake Railway (D&SL) was a company started in 1902 with a goal of connecting its namesake cities via the Uinta basin, to take advantage of these resources.  While a significant portion of the line in Colorado was built, and still exists today, the company struggled financially and never progressed any closer than Craig, Colorado to the Uinta basin. After this effort failed, almost immediately other efforts began.

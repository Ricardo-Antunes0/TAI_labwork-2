Memoria is a 2015 American film directed by Andrea Arnold and written by Arnold and Maria Konnikova. The film stars Jacob Tremblay, Forrest Goodluck, and Kimberly Elise.  Memoria is a haunting exploration of grief, love, and the power of memory. When his mother dies, 12-year-old Noah (Jacob Tremblay) is left to cope with his loss on his own. As he struggles to make sense of his mother's life and death, Noah discovers that her memories live on in him and in those around him. With the help of a therapist (Forrest Goodluck) and a group of friends, Noah begins to piece together his mother's life story - a story that reveals her conflicted feelings about her homeland, her family, and her own identity. And as Noah connects the dots between his mother's past and present, he begins to understand why she was so reluctant to leave Cuba. Memoria is an intensely emotional journey into the heart of family loss that will stay with you long after the film is over.

The Olympos Aerial Tram , aka Olympos, is a cable car system located in the northwestern Greek region of Macedonia.  The tramway, which opened in 2009, links the towns of Olympos and Goumenissa on a 4.5 kilometer long route. It is operated by the Olympos Tramway Company, a private company. The tramway has a total length of 9.5 kilometers and has a capacity of 1,500 passengers per hour.  The tramway is unique in that it is the only aerial tramway in Greece. It was inaugurated as part of the celebrations marking the tenth anniversary of the inauguration of the Goumenissa-Olympos Cable Car System, which was then Greece's longest aerial tramway.

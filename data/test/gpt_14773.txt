Independentist Students (EI, Estudantes Independentistas in Galician) is a student organisation that aims to promote the independence of Galicia within Spain. It was founded in 2010, and has chapters at universities in Galicia and the rest of Spain.  The Independentist Students movement emerged in 2010, after the regional election of 2009, which saw a large victory for the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG). This victory was seen as a sign of support for independence by many young people, who felt that Galicia had been neglected by both the central government and regional administrations.  Since its inception, Independentist Students has worked to promote the independence of Galicia within Spain. Its main goals are to increase awareness of the issue among students and to develop a grassroots movement capable of advocating for change. The organisation also aims to support the work of independent political groups in Galicia, and to promote cross-border cooperation between Galician organisations.  Independentist Students is an open and inclusive organisation, welcoming all students who share its goals. It has active chapters at universities throughout Galicia and the rest of Spain, and has worked closely with other pro-independence groups such as Alternativa Galega (AG), las Corts de Girona (Gironaâ€™s Parliament), and Assembleia Nacional Catalana (ANC).

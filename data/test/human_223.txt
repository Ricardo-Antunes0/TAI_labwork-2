The Wahta Mohawks are a Mohawk First Nation in Ontario. The Wahta Mohawk Territory is their territory (reserve) in the District Municipality of Muskoka, Ontario, Canada near Bala. It is bounded on the west by Highway 400, a major north–south artery in the province.  About one-third of the 831 citizens of Wahta Mohawk Territory live in the community of Wahta, along District Road 38, another third live within 100 km, and the remainder live elsewhere. The land is made up of forest and lakes typical of the rugged Canadian Shield. It is used primarily for hunting and fishing by Mohawk from the reserves of Kanesatake and Kahnewake Quebec, who share access to this territory. It was the site of the now defunct Iroquois Cranberry Growers, which was Ontario's largest cranberry farm. The farm was shuttered because of economic reasons. "Wáhta" is the Mohawk term for the Maple festival, one of their important ceremonies.

Extreme ultraviolet lithography (also known as EUV lithography or extreme ultraviolet lithography 3D printing) is a type of lithography that uses photons in the extreme ultraviolet range to create patterns on a substrate.  Extreme ultraviolet lithography is a type of lithography that uses photons in the extreme ultraviolet range to create patterns on a substrate. This technique is often used for forming small features, such as lines and dots, on engineered materials. Extreme ultraviolet lithography is also used for photolithography, which is the technique used to create patterns on substrates by etching them with light.   Extreme ultraviolet lithography can be used to create images of any size and shape. The patterned substrate can be used in a variety of applications, such as semiconductor manufacturing and 3D printing.

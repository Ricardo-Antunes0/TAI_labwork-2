Cornwell Quality Tools is a privately held company manufacturing tools for the automotive and aviation industries. The company is based in Wadsworth, Ohio. Cornwell remains as one of two remaining mobile tool companies that still produce their own handtools in house at their Albion, Pennsylvania foundry and Mogadore, Ohio machining plants. USA sourced steel is used at these locations to create a more consistent, better quality product than that of overseas manufacturers. They also carry a lifetime warranty on all hand tools and use Taiwan and China manufacturing to round out its product offerings. Cornwell recently acquired Kennedy Manufacturing, Van Wert, Ohio. Kennedy produces their own Kennedy branded line of tool storage products. Cornwell also carries various air, cordless electric, diagnostic, and hand tools from other manufacturers. This is the same practice as Mac Tools, Snap-on, and Matco Tools, who together make up the four major flags of the mobile tool business. The company was founded in 1919 by Eugene Cornwell, a blacksmith from Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio.

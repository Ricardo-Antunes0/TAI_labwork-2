The Black Crow Limestone is an Early Cretaceous sedimentary rock formation located in eastern Montana and western North Dakota. The Black Crow Limestone is composed of alternating beds of dark-gray and light-gray granitic and sandstone, as well as a few small patches of coal. Coal was first identified in the Black Crow Limestone in the early 1800s, but its economic value was not realized until the late 1800s.  The Black Crow Limestone has been used for a variety of purposes, including highway construction, residential construction, and mining. The Black Crow Limestone is currently being mined for coal near the towns of Newcastle and Bismarck in eastern Montana and western North Dakota.

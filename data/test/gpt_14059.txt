The Lancia Delta S4 is a Group B sports car that was produced by the Italian car manufacturer Lancia between 1994 and 1998. It was the first Delta S4 and was based on the Lancia Stratos Concept, which was shown at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1993.  The Delta S4 was designed by Piero Lotti, who also designed the Lancia Stratos. The car featured a lengthened wheelbase and a wider track, with a more powerful engine and aerodynamic enhancements. Sales of the Delta S4 were poor, with only about 1,500 units being sold.

Disney University (DU) is the global training program for employees of the parks and experiences divisions at The Walt Disney Company also known as Cast Members. Many college students can participate through the Disney college program. The Disney college program is a full-time paid internship at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. Students can receive academic credit while building their resume (Tompkins 2021). Although Disney University is not an accredited institution, courses are primarily designed, developed, and delivered by experienced professionals. However, in order to enroll, one needs to be enrolled in an accredited college that will allow the student to take classes and work at Disney. Most colleges allowing it have internships available, and give college credit to do the internship while taking Disney classes. Disney University has traditionally provided learning instructor-led classroom sessions, but eventually expanded delivery methods to accommodate Disney's diverse and growing audience with the advent of eLearning and virtual classrooms.

Ohio Field was a multipurpose stadium on the campus of the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, in use from 1922 to 1998. It was the home field for the Ohio State Buckeyes football team from 1922 to 1997, as well as the baseball team from 1922 to 1955 and the track and field team from 1922 to 1978. From 1918 to 1922, Ohio Field also served as the home field of the Columbus Panhandles football team.  Ohio Field was originally constructed in 1922 at a cost of $100,000 and was originally named "Ohio Stadium". In 1923, it was renamed "Ohio Field at State College" in honor of then-president of The Ohio State University, Arthur St. John Brodie. In 1924, a grandstand was added to the stadium, which increased its capacity to 45,000. In 1966, an upper deck was added to the stadium, which increased its capacity to over 60,000.  In 1998, Ohio Stadium was closed due to safety concerns after a series of collapses of concrete beams caused by corrosion. The last game played at Ohio Stadium was on November 12, 1998 against the Michigan Wolverines. Since then, the stadium has been demolished and replaced by a new facility known as "The Horseshoe", which opened in November 2014.

A diocesan feud  is either a dispute or conflict between two or more Roman Catholic dioceses within the same country, province or territory.  Typically, a diocesan feud arises when one or more diocesan bishops feel that their authority has been undermined by another bishop. The dispute may involve allegations of financial impropriety, neglect of pastoral responsibilities, or interference in diocesan affairs. A diocesan feud can also result from theological differences or personality clashes between bishops.  Generally, the issue that sparked the dispute is minor, but the rivalry between the bishops can become acrimonious and lead to physical confrontations. In some cases, the rival bishops will refuse to cooperate with one another, which can have a devastating effect on the Catholic community in their territory.  There have been occasions where entire dioceses have split over disagreements between their bishops. The most famous example of this is the Irish Catholic Church schism of 1871-1874, which led to the formation of the Irish Free State.

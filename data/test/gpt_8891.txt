Swedish Americans  are Americans of at least partial Swedish descent. The first Swedes to arrive in North America were a group of about twenty Lutheran clergy who sailed from Stockholm in 1638 on the ship Christoffer Oxenstierna. They settled in New Sweden, which was located on the southern coast of what is now Delaware. The Swedish colony was short-lived, however, and was defeated by the Dutch in 1655.   After New Sweden's dissolution, Swedes began to arrive in increasing numbers through immigration. In the late eighteenth century, many Swedes came to the United States as farmers and craftsmen, seeking opportunities that were not available at home. In the early nineteenth century, many Swedes came to the United States to escape the Napoleonic Wars and the economic hardships that followed. By the mid-nineteenth century, there were an estimated 25,000 Swedish Americans living in the United States.   Today, Swedish Americans are a well-established community in the United States. They are found in all parts of the country, from rural areas to major metropolitan areas. They have played an important role in American culture and history, and have made significant contributions to both American society and economy.

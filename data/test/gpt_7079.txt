Process engineering is the understanding and application of engineering principles and techniques to the design, control, and operation of industrial processes. It is a multidisciplinary field that draws on principles of engineering, chemistry, physics, and mathematics.  Process engineering is an important discipline because it enables industrial processes to be designed and operated effectively. Process engineers also play a critical role in safety management, environmental compliance, and product quality.  The field of process engineering has evolved rapidly over the past several decades. Today, process engineers use a variety of technologies to design and monitor industrial processes. They also use mathematical models to improve process performance.  Process engineering is a rapidly growing field. The demand for process engineers is expected to grow by about 14% over the next decade. Therefore, it is important for students interested in this field to have a broad understanding of engineering principles and techniques. Additionally, process engineers need to be able to use various technologies to design and monitor industrial processes.

Cofachique (pronounced ko-fa-chee) is a ghost town in Ellis County, Kansas, United States. It is located about 4 miles north of the town of Ellisburg.  Cofachique was founded in 1887 by two brothers, George and Harry Sinclair. The settlement was initially named "Tuttlesville" after one of the brothers' fathers, but was renamed Cofachique after a nearby stream was called "Cofachique Creek". The town had a post office from 1888 until it closed in 1909.  The population of Cofachique peaked at around 100 in the early 1900s, but by the 1950s it had dwindled to just four residents. The town's final resident, Elmer H. Wright, died in 2006.  Cofachique is now a popular tourist destination due to its unique architecture and history. The town is home to several historic buildings, including the Cofachique Opera House (built in 1907), the Cofachique School (built in 1908), and the Cofachique Hotel (built in 1912).

Lake Kununurra is a freshwater man-made reservoir located in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. It is the second-largest man-made lake in Australia and third-largest in the world. The lake is a popular tourist destination, and is used for recreation, such as fishing, boating, water skiing and swimming.  Lake Kununurra was created by the construction of the Kununurra Dam between 1954 and 1957. The dam was constructed as part of the USA's development of the atomic bomb project in the region, and its primary purpose was to provide potable water for the atomic testing site. The lake is named after the local Aboriginal tribe, the Kununurra people.

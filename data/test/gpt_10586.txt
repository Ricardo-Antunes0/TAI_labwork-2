They have released two studio albums, "Nostalgia" (2009) and "The Other Side of Silence" (2013), and a number of singles.  Alia Tempora was formed in 2006 by guitarist and songwriter Vojtěch Novotný and drummer Václav Pavlík. The band's lineup has since stabilized and now includes singer Michal Kříž, keyboardist and background vocalist Iva Švecová, bassist Jakub Kopecký, and guitarist Lukáš Novotný.  Their debut album, "Nostalgia", was recorded in 2009 with producer Cezar Zavadil at the Abyss Studio in Prague.

Their second album, "The Other Side of Silence", was recorded in 2013 at the Audiohammer Studio in Prague with producer Jan Kopecký. It is darker and more experimental than "Nostalgia", incorporating elements of Krautrock, electronica, and industrial music. The album was again well-received by critics, who praised its technicality and ambitious soundscape. It has been nominated for a Czech Grammy Award for Best Album.

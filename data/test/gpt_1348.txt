A hagioscope (from Gr. άγιος, holy, and σκοπός, object of sight or study) is an optical instrument used in antiquity for viewing religious images. It consisted of a small box with a lens at one end and a hole in the bottom for viewing below. The lens was mounted on a movable arm, so that it could be directed toward any desired image.

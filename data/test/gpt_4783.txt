Reginald Stephen "Reggie, The Ruffian" Fleming (April 16, 1907 â€“ October 25, 1978) was an American professional wrestler, actor and promoter.  Born in San Francisco, California, Fleming began his professional wrestling career in 1929 as The Ruffian, utilizing a rough and tumble style that quickly made him a fan favorite. He became one of the most popular wrestlers in the country, touring throughout North America and Europe. In 1935, he won the World Heavyweight Championship from Lou Thesz. He held the title for over a year before losing it to NWA World Heavyweight Champion Bobo Brazil.  Fleming later became an actor, appearing in a number of Hollywood films throughout the 1940s and 1950s. His most notable role was as the bumbling but lovable assistant sheriff in the film classic "The Lone Ranger" (1949). After retiring from acting in the early 1960s, Fleming began promoting wrestling events throughout California. He died in 1978 at the age of 76.

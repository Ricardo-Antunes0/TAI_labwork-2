Three Loves is a 1932 novel by James Baldwin. It tells the story of Terence, a young African American man in Harlem in the 1930s, and his relationships with two women: Emmeline, his white girlfriend; and Annie, a black woman with whom he has a sexual relationship.  The novel draws on Baldwin's own experiences as a young man in Harlem during the 1930s and is noted for its exploration of race relations in America. It has been praised for its powerful and evocative writing, and has been cited as an influential work in the development of post-war African-American literature.  Three Loves was published in English in 1932 and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction that year. It was later translated into many languages and has been frequently adapted for stage and screen.

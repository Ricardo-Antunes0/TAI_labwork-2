Grosvenor Arundell Francis (14 August 1873 – 30 November 1944) was an Australian  politician.  He was the Nationalist Party member for the House of Representatives seat of Kennedy from 1925 to 1929. Francis was brought up in Normanton, where his father was the local lands commissioner, and moved with his family as a child to Maryborough, Brisbane and Cunnamulla. He was educated at a preparatory school and then Brisbane Grammar School; he was in boarding school from age nine. He worked in "clerical and mercantile pursuits" at Cunnamulla for two years after finishing school, then worked for three years as a law clerk at Charleville. He did his articled clerkship at Charleville, was admitted as a solicitor in Brisbane, and then moved to Charters Towers, where he commenced practicing as a solicitor in 1901. In 1906, he entered into partnership with John Marsland in the firm of Marsland and Marsland, then one of the largest law firms in North Queensland; upon Marsland's retirement in 1913, Francis bought him out and continued practising under that name. A Freemason, he was the District Grand Master of Northern Queensland in 1922–23. He was also a director of the North Queensland Worsteel and Woollen Mills (Charters Towers), Ltd.

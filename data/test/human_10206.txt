Njerep (Njerup) is a Mambiloid language spoken in the Adamawa Region of Cameroon. Njerep is essentially extinct, with only 4 people who speak it at home (in 2018). Though word lists and grammatical information have been collected from these people, the information remains fragmented. General information Njerep is considered a critically endangered language under the UNESCO language endangerment index. Research conducted in 2000 indicates that only six speakers of this language remain, all of whom reside in the Somié village located along the Nigeria-Cameroon border (6°28' N, 11° 27' E). Of these six speakers, only one remains conversant in the language. The others have been reported to be semi-speakers. The youngest of the speakers was born in the 1940s, and it appears unlikely that Njerep will survive past the current generation. Njerep is no longer a language of casual conversation. Instead, it is most often used for maintaining secrecy in conversation. According to a study in 2007, only four people spoke this language. All of them were elderly.  The Mambila language, also known as Mvop, has instead supplanted Njerep in casual use.

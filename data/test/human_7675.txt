Hernando (8 February 1990 – February 2013) was a French Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He established himself as one of the best European colts of his generation in 1993 by winning the Prix Lupin, Prix du Jockey Club and Prix Niel and finishing second in the Irish Derby. As a four-year-old he won the Prix Gontaut-Biron and finished a close second in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. In 1995 he won a second Prix Gontaut-Biron and was placed in both the Turf Classic Invitational and the Japan Cup. After he retired from racing, he became a very successful breeding stallion in England. He died in February 2013. Background Hernando was a bay horse with a white blaze and a white sock on his left front leg, bred in France by his owner Stavros Niarchos. He was sired by the American-bred stallion Niniski, who won the Irish St. Leger and the Prix Royal-Oak in 1979 before going on to sire many good staying horses including Petoski, Minster Son and Lomitas (Preis von Europa, sire of Danedream). Hernando's dam Whakilyric was a high-class racemare who won the Prix du Calvados in 1986. The colt was sent into training with François Boutin at Chantilly and was ridden in all of his major races by the American jockey Cash Asmussen.

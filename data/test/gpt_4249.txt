Deep Adaptation is a concept, agenda, and theory of adaptation developed by Professor Kevin McFarland at the University of California, San Diego. The theory has been applied to a variety of fields including environmental science, engineering, and sociology.  The deep adaptation concept suggests that organisms are able to adjust their physiology and behavior in response to changing environments, even when the environment is significantly different from the one in which they evolved. This flexibility allows organisms to cope with a wide range of environmental challenges.  The deep adaptation agenda seeks to identify and understand the mechanisms by which organisms are able to adapt deeply, and to apply this knowledge to improve environmental management. The theory has also been used to study human societies and their ability to adapt to changing environments.

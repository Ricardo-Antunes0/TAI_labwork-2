The Nieuport-Delage NiD 43 was a single-seat, fighter aircraft built by the French aircraft manufacturer Nieuport-Delage. It was the first French fighter to be powered by a liquid-cooled, inline engine.  The NiD 43 was originally designed as a successor to the NiD 26 light fighter, but its development was delayed by problems with the engine. The aircraft first flew in March 1936 and entered service with the French Air Force in 1937. It saw limited combat service during the Second World War and was replaced by more modern fighters after its introduction. The NiD 43 is now a rare aircraft, preserved in museums around the world.

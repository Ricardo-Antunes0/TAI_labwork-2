The Plymouth General Court (formerly styled, The Plymouth Colony Court) is the oldest court in the United States. Formed in 1691, it is the first of its kind in what would later become the United States. The court tries cases involving all residents of Plymouth Colony, which at the time included present-day Massachusetts and Rhode Island.  The General Court is made up of a governor, deputy governor, secretary, and four assistants. The court meets monthly on the first and third Tuesday of every month in the colonial meeting house. Cases are heard by a jury, which consists of 12 citizens chosen at random from among those who have registered to vote in Plymouth Colony. The verdict of a jury is final.  The General Court has been responsible for creating many important legal precedents, including the right to trial by jury and the doctrine of implied consent. It also played a role in establishing Plymouth Colony as a leading economic and political force in North America.

Bent Jædig (28 September 1935 – 9 November 1997) was a Danish painter.  Born in 1935 in the town of Horsens, Bent Jædig attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1955 to 1960, studying under Hans Brinker-Sorensen and Per Kirkeby. He first gained recognition for his psychedelic paintings of the late 1960s, but he is best known for his later abstract works which often employ bright colors and large shapes. Jædig died in 1997 in Copenhagen.

The Opel Insignia is a large family car (D-segment in Europe) developed and produced by the German car manufacturer Opel since 2008.  Taking its name from a 2003 concept car, the model line serves as the flagship Opel car line, slotted above the Astra and Corsa in size.  The Insignia serves as the successor for both the Signum and Vectra model lines, replacing both vehicles under a single nameplate.  Currently in its second generation, the model line is offered in four-door sedan/saloon body styles, five-door liftback, and as a five-door station wagon/estate.      Sold worldwide, the Insignia is marketed under multiple nameplates.  Under Opel tradition, the model line is marketed by Vauxhall in the United Kingdom, taking on the Vauxhall Insignia name.  Both generations of the model line have been marketed in Latin America and North America as the Buick Regal (sales of the Regal continue in China).  GM Australia marketed the second-generation Insignia as the Holden Commodore through 2020 (until discontinuing both the model line and the Holden brand).

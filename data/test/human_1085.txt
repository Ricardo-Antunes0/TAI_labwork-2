The Rental Car Rally is a 36-hour city-to-city road rally that takes place on public roads several times a year in different cities, with a different route each time. RCR sees an annual entry of about 30 cars per rally, with each team required to compete in a themed costume of their choosing, so long as the costume includes their vehicle. The rally is not a serious race in the traditional sense of competitive rally driving, though teams win by merit of their costumes and low mileage. Organizers emphasize that Rental Car Rally is a road trip and not a race. History Franz Aliquo and Steve Bryant created the Rental Car Rally series in 2008. Drawing inspiration from the Cannonball Run films, Smokey and the Bandit, the Wacky Races cartoons as well as the Gumball 3000, the Rental Car Rally was born as a more reasonable alternative to for those wanting to participate in a rally but who may not have the time and money required to complete in events such as the Bullrun and the Gumball 3000.

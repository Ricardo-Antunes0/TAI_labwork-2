The Salomons, later Goldsmid-Stern-Salomons Baronetcy, of Broomhall in the County of Hertford, was a title in the Baronetage of England. It was created on 15 July 1611 for Simon Salomon, who had earlier served as Member of Parliament for Hertford. The second Baronet represented Hertfordshire in the House of Commons. The title became extinct on the death of the fourth Baronet in 1792.   The family seats were Broomhall, Hertfordshire and Llandovery Castle, Carmarthenshire.

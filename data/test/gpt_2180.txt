Ladin speakers are descendants of the Romanized Alpine peoples who lived in the area that is now South Tyrol before the 5th century AD. Ladin has many words that are similar to those spoken by the Romans who invaded and conquered Tyrol in the mid-1st century BC.   Ladin was first written down in the 12th century AD. At that time, it was used primarily as a literary language by the clergy. In 1528, Ladin became an official language of South Tyrol. Today, it is mainly spoken in rural areas and among the older generation. There is a growing number of Ladin speakers who are able to use the language outside of South Tyrol.

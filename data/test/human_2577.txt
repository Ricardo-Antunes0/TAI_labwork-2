Odelltown is a former town in southern Quebec, Canada located on Route 221, 4.7 km (2.9 mi) south of Lacolle, Quebec. The settlement was named after Joseph Odell, a United Empire Loyalist and Founder Pioneer of the Odell Family in Odelltown, Province of Lower Canada (now Quebec, Canada). The hamlet has since been made part of Lacolle. The area was the scene of a battle on 28 June 1814 during the War of 1812 between American and British forces. It resulted in a British victory. Odelltown was also the scene of two engagements between rebels and loyalists during the Lower Canada Rebellion between 7 November 1838 and 9 November 1838. Both engagements resulted in loyalist victories. Odell family Joseph Odell Sr. and his wife, Martha Manning, settled in this area together with six of their seven sons.  Joseph Odell Sr. later moved to the Sutton area.  The stone house, built in 1801 by their third son, Joseph Odell Jr. (m. Sarah (Sally) Lewis) still stands to this day on the northeast side of 221 and Montée Guay just south along 221 from the Odelltown Methodist Church. There were several houses belonging to the sons of Joseph Odell Sr. built along this road right up to the Canadian/American Border. The Odelltown Methodist Church (1823) is now a heritage site.  There is an annual service followed by a picnic the last Sunday of June, rain or shine.

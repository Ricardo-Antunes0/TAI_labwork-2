Raffaele Bendandi (17 October 1893 â€“ 3 May 1955) was an Italian film director, screenwriter and actor. He directed 45 films in a career lasting from 1925 to 1955. He wrote screenplays for 37 of these films.  Bendandi was born in Rome, the son of the actor and stage manager Angelo Bendandi. He began his career as an actor, appearing in stage productions such as "Il barbiere di Siviglia" and "La fanciulla del West". He made his film debut in 1925 with the drama "Il ladro di biciclette". Over the next decade he directed mostly melodramas and crime films, but his output began to increase in the late 1930s with the advent of neorealist cinema. His most highly regarded film is the war drama "L'ultimo giorno di guerra" (1943), which won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Bendandi died in Rome three years later at the age of 58.

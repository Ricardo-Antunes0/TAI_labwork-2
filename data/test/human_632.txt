Toshifumi (Toshi) Yokota  is a medical scientist and professor of medical genetics at the University of Alberta, where he also holds the Friends of Garrett Cumming Research & Muscular Dystrophy Canada Endowed Research Chair and the Henri M. Toupin Chair in Neurological Science. He is best known for his studies of antisense oligonucleotide-based therapeutics for muscular dystrophy that led to the development of an FDA-approved drug viltolarsen. His research interests include precision medicine for muscular dystrophy and genetic diseases. He has co-edited two books both published in the Methods in Molecular Biology series from Humana Press, Springer-Nature, and has published more than 100 refereed papers and patents.  He is a member of the editorial boards for the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, Genes, Frontiers in Genome Editing, and Nucleic Acid Therapeutics  a member of the Medical and Scientific Advisory Committee of Muscular Dystrophy Canada, and a co-founder of the Canadian Neuromuscular Network (CAN-NMD). Biography  Yokota was born in Morioka, a city in Iwate Prefecture, and raised in multiple cities including Tsu, Mie and Nerima, Tokyo, in Japan. He was initially interested in astrophysics; however, his interests changed after taking a genetics class and hearing about gene therapy research for muscular dystrophy at the University of Tokyo. After receiving research training at the University of Tokyo and the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, he received his Ph.D. in Biological Science, where he studied the mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle regeneration. He completed his post-doctoral training at Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus as a Research Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.  He was a Research Associate at the Children's National Medical Center before joining the University of Alberta. Currently, he is a tenured Professor at the University of Alberta Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, serving as the Friends of Garrett Cumming Research & Muscular Dystrophy Canada Endowed Research Chair and the Henri M. Toupin Chair in Neurological Science since 2011.

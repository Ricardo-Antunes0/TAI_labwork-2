Battle of Varkaus was a battle of the Russo-Swedish War of 1741-1743, fought between the Russian army under Ivan Suvorov and the Swedish army under Carl Gustaf Armfeldt. The Swedish forces were numerically superior, but Suvorov's tactical skill won the day for the Russians.  In 1741, Sweden was embroiled in a war with Russia. The Russians wanted to retake Finland and neutralize Sweden as a threat to their border. Carl Gustaf Armfeldt, the Swedish commander-in-chief decided to launch a counterattack against the Russian forces occupying Ostrobothnia. His plan was to use his numerically superior forces to encircle and then destroy the Russian army.  On 20 July 1741, Armfeldt launched his attack against the Russian positions near Varkaus. The Swedes managed to surround and destroy the Russian army, killing or wounding almost 10,000 men.

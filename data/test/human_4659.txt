Lauren Lenentine (born June 24, 2000) is a Canadian curler originally from Cornwall, Prince Edward Island and currently from Winnipeg, Manitoba. She currently plays lead for the Mackenzie Zacharias rink from Manitoba. Career Lenentine curled out of her home province of Prince Edward Island for most of her junior career before moving to Nova Scotia for the 2018–19 season to join the Kaitlyn Jones rink, replacing Kristin Clarke who aged out of juniors and had joined Mary-Anne Arsenault's rink. The team was invited to play in the 2018 Masters Grand Slam of Curling event as the sponsors exemption. Despite this, they finished the round robin with a 3–1 record, beating Rachel Homan, Kerri Einarson and Silvana Tirinzoni with their only loss coming to Tracy Fleury. They couldn't continue their momentum into the playoffs however, falling to Chelsea Carey in the quarterfinals. They lost the semifinal of the 2019 Canadian Junior Curling Championships to BC's Sarah Daniels. The following season, she and teammate Karlee Burgess moved to Manitoba to join the Zacharias siblings Mackenzie and Emily to try to return to the World Juniors. When the team won the Manitoba Junior Provincials, it made Lenentine the first female junior curler to represent three provinces at the Canadian Junior Curling Championships. The team went on to win the 2020 Canadian Junior Curling Championships and later the 2020 World Junior Curling Championships.

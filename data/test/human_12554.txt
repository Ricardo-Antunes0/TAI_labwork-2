The RS Elite class is a 24-foot keelboat (7.3 m) class designed by Phil Morrison. Built to meet the requirements of the Hayling Island Sailing Club, the class has a start at Cowes Week and events around the United Kingdom. Fleets can be found at the Royal Burnham Yacht Club in the UK, as well as at Falmouth, Belfast Lough, Cowes, Hayling Island and Lymington. Outside the UK, the class can be found in locations such as the Caribbean, Guernsey, Holland, Norway and Sweden. Performance and design The RS Elite draws , and adheres to one-design principles. The keel is moulded on to vertical stainless-steel struts. The boat has a "long sloping transom" and almost parallel sides, a maximised waterline length, and the boat is designed for speed and control. For racing it is a no-hiking boat: crewsâ€™ knees must stay inside the boat at all times. There is a full-length alloy tube kickbar down the centreline of the boat, which occupants hook their feet under.

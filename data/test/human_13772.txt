Donut County is an indie video game developed by American indie designer Ben Esposito and published by Annapurna Interactive. In the game, the player moves a hole to swallow objects, which makes the hole increase in size. The concept originated in a game jam that used video game pitches from a Twitter account parody of game designer Peter Molyneux, and later added a mechanic similar to that of Katamari Damacy. Other inspirations for the game included Hopi figurinesa theme Esposito later relinquishedand locations from Bruce Springsteen songs. Donut County was released in August 2018 for iOS, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Microsoft Windows platforms while versions for Xbox One and Nintendo Switch were released in December 2018. It also released for Android in December 2020. Gameplay  In Donut County, the players control a hole across several different levels, each of which is self contained but has several areas that open up as they progress. The goal of the game is to swallow every object to essentially clear out the level. As players move the hole to swallow objects, the hole increases in size. There are some puzzle aspects to this; to swallow objects floating on top of water, the player may need to maneuver the hole to drain part of the water, and then have that water consumed by a bird, repeating this until the water is drained. Later in the game, the player gains access to a catapult that fits in the top of the hole. This can be used to fling certain items swallowed by it to hit outcroppings to dislodge objects or to trigger switches.

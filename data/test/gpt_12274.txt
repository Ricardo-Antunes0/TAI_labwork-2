The Berkshire Hills Express was a full-service passenger train operated by the New England Central Railroad in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. The train ran between Boston and Springfield, Massachusetts, via the Berkshire Hills Tunnel.  The Berkshire Hills Express was inaugurated on October 4, 1955, as a replacement for the "Boston Local", which ran between Springfield and Boston via the Berkshires. The "Express" ran hourly during peak hours, and made fewer stops than the Local. In 1971, the New England Central merged with other railroads to form Amtrak, and the Berkshire Hills Express became part of the "Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority" (MBTA) system. Amtrak discontinued service on the Berkshire Hills Express on September 30, 1985.

The charango is a small Andean stringed instrument made of a single piece of wood, typically with a soundboard that is slightly arched and a wooden neck and fingerboard. It is played by plucking the strings with the fingers, and is similar to the harp, but smaller. The charango is often used in folk music and is also popular in Latin American and Caribbean music.

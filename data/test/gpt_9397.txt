Cinachyrella is a genus of marine sponges in the family Hymenochaetaceae. The genus is endemic to the eastern Pacific Ocean.  The genus Cinachyrella was first described by American zoologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1876. Cope created the genus based on a single species of sponge he had collected off the coast of California. At the time, Cope proposed that the sponge be placed in a new genus named after his daughter, Cinachyrella.  Currently, Cinachyrella comprises two species: C. elegans and C. maculosa. Both species are restricted to the eastern Pacific Ocean, where they are found off the coasts of California, Oregon, and Mexico. The sponges are small and brown in color, and they inhabit soft substrates at depths ranging from 0 to 150 meters.  Although little is known about the biology of the genus Cinachyrella, it is likely that the sponges are predators that feed on small crustaceans and other marine organisms. Like many other marine sponges, Cinachyrella may play an important role in marine ecosystems by providing shelter and food for other creatures.

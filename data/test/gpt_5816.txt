The Pintupi are one of the largest and most widely dispersed Aboriginal groups in Australia. Their traditional territory extends across much of the Western Desert region, including parts of the Great Sandy Desert and the Barkly Tablelands. The Pintupi are also recognised as the traditional owners of the land on which they live, having occupied this area for over 50,000 years.  The Pintupi are a nomadic people, living in temporary campsites throughout their traditional territory. They rely mainly on hunting and gathering for their food, and are particularly known for their fine artistry in crafting ceremonial objects from natural materials. The Pintupi have a strong cultural tradition, which is maintained through oral history and storytelling.  The Pintupi are currently engaged in a number of projects designed to protect their cultural heritage and preserve their way of life. These projects include the establishment of a tribal homeland on the outskirts of their traditional territory, and the development of a tourism industry based around traditional Pintupi culture and customs.

The Republic of Genoa  was a medieval maritime republic in north-western Italy, that existed from 1258 to 1797. It was the most powerful Mediterranean state for over a century, and at its height was one of the major powers in Europe. The state was ruled by a hereditary aristocratic class known as the Genoese families.  The republic was founded on 7 March 1258, when the Genoese families of Liguria invaded the Piedmontese city of Savona. The original Genoese constitution was based on the principle of a free and independent republic, although it was ruled by a doge (duke) who was elected by a assembly of nobles. The doge presided over a Senate and a popular assembly, but had no real power. The state was divided into districts, each ruled by a count. The Genoa fleet was the largest and most powerful in the Mediterranean Sea, and its colonies included Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily and Malta.  The Republic of Genoa suffered from economic problems throughout its history. In 1347–1348, Genoa became embroiled in the War of Chioggia (Italian War of Chioggia), which ended with the victory of Venice. In 1390–1391, Genoa became embroiled in the War of Ferrara-Genoa, which ended with the victory of Ferrara. In 1453, Genoa joined the Holy League against Venice and in 1454 they helped Milan to expel the Venetians from Lombardy

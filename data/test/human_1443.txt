Christ Crucified  is a 1780 oil-on-canvas painting of the crucifixion of Jesus by Spanish Romantic painter Francisco de Goya. He presented it to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando as his reception piece as an academic painter. It now forms part of the permanent collection of the Prado Museum in Madrid. Analysis  The painting is neoclassical in style, though rooted in traditional Spanish iconography of the subject and related to the treatment of the same topic by Velázquez (even borrowing its dark black background with no landscape) and Anton Raphael Mengs (borrowing his presentation of the right leg pushed forwards). Goya conforms to the Spanish Baroque iconographic rules for portraying the Crucifixion as laid down by Francisco Pacheco – the black background, four rather than three nails, supported feet and a trilingual inscription at the top of the cross beginning IESUS NAZARENUS REX IUDEORUM. By obeying these rules Goya diminished the emphasis on devotional features such as drama and the presence of blood in order to concentrate attention on the painting's soft modelling, since his intention was to please the academicians then dominated by Mengs' neoclassicism.

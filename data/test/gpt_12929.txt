The Dale Warland Singers (DWS) was a singing group which toured North America from the early 1960s until the mid-1980s.  The DWS was formed in 1961 by Dale Warland, who had been a member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir from 1954 to 1959. Warland decided to form his own group in order to tour more extensively and to perform works that were not typically featured in Mormon Tabernacle concerts. The DWS initially consisted of Warland, his brother Don and their friend Gary Sievers.  The DWS quickly became one of the most successful singing groups in North America, and toured extensively throughout the continent. The group's repertoire ranged from popular secular songs such as "White Christmas" and "Can't Help Falling in Love" to religious classics such as "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" and "O Holy Night". The DWS also performed frequently at major concert venues such as the Hollywood Bowl and New York's Carnegie Hall.  The DWS disbanded in the early 1980s, but reunited for a highly anticipated reunion tour in 2003. The group has not performed publicly since then, but continues to make occasional appearances at church functions.

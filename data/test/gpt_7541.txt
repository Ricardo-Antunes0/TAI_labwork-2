Universal measuring machines (UMM) are measurement devices that can be used to measure a large variety of dimensions. They are classified into two types:   The first type is the manual type, which is manually operated and needs a human operator to move the measuring tape or gauge. The second type is the automatic type, which is operated by a computer or other automatic device and does not need a human operator.  UMM are mainly used in industry, research, and education. They are also used in other fields, such as civil engineering, surveying, and architecture.

The Aluu Four lynching was a necklace lynching that involved four young men, Ugonna Obuzor, Toku Lloyd, Chiadika Biringa, and Tekena Elkanah, all students of the University of Port Harcourt. They were all lynched after they were falsely accused of theft in Aluu, a community in Obio/Akpor local government area, Rivers State, Nigeria on 5 October 2012. Incident Chiadika Biringa, Lloyd Toku Mike, Favour Erikena and Ugonna Obuzor were all friends, first sons of their parents, and students of University of Port Harcourt. The four students were also occasional roommates. Ugonna sometimes spent the night with Favour who lived outside the campus because his residence on campus was broken into multiple times. Ugonna had a debtor called Bright who was owing him some undisclosed amount of money which bothered him much. In time, Ugonna managed to find out Bright's particular location. He sought the help of his cousin Lloyd, childhood and longtime friend Favour and roommate Chiadika. Together, four of them ventured into a journey of no return. The four students finally arrived in the house of the debtor at about midnight, a time that seem odd for anyone to move about, carrying axe, pen knife, and Cutlass in order to scare the debtor. In the cause of settling the debt, a misunderstanding ensued which turned sour and eventually turned into a fight.

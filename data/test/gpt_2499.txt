The Nyah Kur (known in Thai as Nga Khun or Nga Yun) are an indigenous people of Thailand. They live in the provinces of Ubon Ratchathani, Chiang Mai, and Lampang.  The Nyah Kur are a Tai-Kadai people who speak a Tai language. They are hunter-gatherers and have a traditional way of life that is based on agriculture, herding, and hunting. They are also involved in traditional handicrafts such as pottery and basketry.  The Nyah Kur are one of the most endangered ethnic groups in Thailand. Their population has decreased by more than 50% since the 1970s, and their number is estimated to be around 3,000 individuals. The main reason for their decline is the increased pressure from the Thai government and the logging industry.

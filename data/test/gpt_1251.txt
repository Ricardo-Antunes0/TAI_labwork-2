The Colonial Defence Committee (CDC) was a committee formed in the United Kingdom in 1914 to help administer the British Empire during World War I. The committee was chaired by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and had representatives from the War Office, Colonial Office and Board of Trade.  The committee was created to deal with issues such as recruitment, training and logistics, as well as to provide advice on strategy. It also liaised with the Dominion governments and organised propaganda campaigns in support of the war effort. In total, the committee oversaw the mobilization of over two million men and women from throughout the empire. After the war, it was disbanded and its functions transferred to other government departments.

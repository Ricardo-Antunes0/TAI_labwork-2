Irréversible  is a 2002 French psychological thriller film directed by Gaspar Noé. The screenplay by Noé and Philippe Lioret is based on the novel Irréversible by Anne Rice.  The film tells the story of a young couple who are savagely assaulted and left for dead on a beach in the south of France. They are discovered and rushed to a hospital, but as the husband begins to regain consciousness he discovers that he can't remember what happened before the attack. His wife is still in a coma, and he has no recollection of what led up to it.  As the weeks go by and the husband starts to piece together what might have happened, it becomes clear that there is something very wrong with his memory. He can't remember his family, his job, or anything about his life before the attack. He begins to fear that he may never be able to recover his memories, and becomes increasingly paranoid that someone is trying to erase them from his mind.  As the husband's memories start to resurface, it becomes clear that this was not just an ordinary attack - something terrible has indeed happened, and it may be impossible to undo.

In electronics, a cross section, cross-section, or sectional view is a visual representation of the physical structure of an object or material.  Typically, it is displayed as a two-dimensional representation on a flat surface, typically a sheet of paper, a screen, or a projection screen. It can also be displayed three-dimensionally in space. A cross section can be viewed from any angle and is often used to show how different parts of an object or material join together.  Cross sections can also be used to show how an electronic device operates. For example, in the schematic diagram of an electronic circuit, the cross section of the circuit shown would show which parts are connected to each other. Cross sections can also be used to measure the size and shape of objects and materials.

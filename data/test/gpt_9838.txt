In mathematics and science, a nonlinear system is a mathematical or physical system that is not linear, in the sense that there are relationships between its input and output that are not always proportional. Nonlinear systems can be highly unpredictable, and can exhibit chaotic behavior. They are also very sensitive to initial conditions, and can require extensive experimentation to accurately predict their behavior.  Despite the challenges inherent in working with nonlinear systems, they are frequently used in a variety of fields, including engineering, physics, chemistry, and biology. They are also used in financial analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

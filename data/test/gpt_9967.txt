FAUST (Functional AUdio STream) is a domain-specific language for audio signal processing. It is designed to be fast, reliable, and extensible. FAUST supports real-time signal processing, synthesis, and analysis. It is also designed to be easy to use and to integrate with other software.    FAUST was created by Stefan Seifert, Timo Ter√§s, and Christoph Lampe in 2006 as a research project at the University of Kaiserslautern. The first release of FAUST was in 2007. FAUST has been used to develop applications such as a real-time audio editor and a real-time audio signal processor for music transcription.

"The Buys" is the third episode of the first season of the HBO original series, The Wire. The episode was written by David Simon from a story by David Simon & Ed Burns and was directed by Peter Medak. It originally aired on June 16, 2002. Plot summary Daniels attends a meeting in Burrell's office to account for the actions of his men in starting a riot at the tower projects. When Daniels suggests that Prez be restricted to office work, Major Stanislaus Valchek, Prez's father-in-law, insists this would be an admission of guilt. Afterwards, Burrell again insists on a simple investigation focused on arrests and seizures rather than securing convictions against the Barksdales. McNulty is frustrated that the detail has no photo of Avon. However, Freamon takes an interest when Greggs mentions Avon's former career in boxing. The next day, he returns with a promotional poster bearing a picture of a young Avon.

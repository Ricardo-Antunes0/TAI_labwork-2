Joe Faragalli (April 18, 1929 – April 10, 2006) was a gridiron football player and coach who had most of his success in the Canadian Football League.  Faragalli played guard at Villanova University from 1950 to 1953, and was the team captain all four years. He was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the 12th round (138th overall pick) of the 1954 NFL Draft. He served four years in Germany with the United States Army and went on to coach college football in the United States. Coaching career Known affectionately throughout the CFL as "Papa Joe," Faragalli joined the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 1967 as an offensive coach. In 1981, he became head coach of the Saskatchewan Roughriders and was awarded the Annis Stukus Trophy as Coach of the Year; the team, 2–14 in each of the preceding two seasons, finished with a 9–7 record in 1981 (despite this, the team narrowly missed the playoffs). Faragalli was replaced by Rueben Berry in 1983 after Saskatchewan got off to a 1–5 start to the season.

The National Fascist Party (, PNF) was a political party in Italy. It was founded on 7 October 1922 by Benito Mussolini, initially as the National Socialist Party of Italy.  The PNF was a nationalist and racial party whose aim was to unify Italy through a dictatorship under the leadership of Mussolini. After World War II, the PNF was considered a terrorist organization by the Italian government. It left the Italian Social Republic after the fall of Mussolini and disbanded in 1943.  Today, the PNF is not a recognized political party in Italy. However, several splinter groups continue to exist, some of which are still active.

William Hepburn Buckler, FBA (1867â€“1952) was a British historian of art.  Buckler was born in Scotland in 1867, the son of a doctor. He was educated at Glasgow and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read History. In 1896 he became a Fellow of Trinity.  Buckler's early work was on the history of architecture, but he soon turned to the history of art, and became one of the leading British historians of his generation. He wrote extensively on medieval art, Italian Renaissance art, and eighteenth-century British art. His work on Turner was particularly influential. He also wrote extensively on archaeology and numismatics.  Buckler retired from teaching in 1946, but continued to write until his death in 1952.

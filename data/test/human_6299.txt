Thietmar or Dithmar was a German Christian pilgrim who visited the Holy Land in 1217â€“1218 and wrote an account of his travels, the . According to his own account, Thietmar and a group of pilgrims set out from Germany "signed with and protected by the cross". This would seem to indicate that he was a crusader, a conclusion accepted by Jaroslav Folda, but his account indicates that he was an unarmed pilgrim. From his work it can be seen that he was an educated man. He is sometimes called magister (teacher, German ), but the better manuscript tradition does not contain this word. He was probably a churchman from Westphalia and the leader of his group. He has been called a Franciscan friar, but the Chronicle of Nicholas Glassberger, written between 1491 and 1508, calls him a monk. Glassberger also wrote that he prepared his book for Pope Honorius III, although Glassberger may have inferred this from the text itself. He also associates the pope's receipt of the book with the preaching of the Fifth Crusade, which had begun under his predecessor, Innocent III.

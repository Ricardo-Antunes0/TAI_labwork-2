Receptor activator of nuclear factor κ B (RANK) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RANK gene. RANK is a member of the NF-κB family of transcription factors, and its main function is to activate the transcription of genes that promote cell survival.  The RANK receptor is a type I transmembrane protein that associates with the death domain protein DR3 (also known as NEMO), forming a heterodimer. The heterodimer specifically binds to the pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, BCL-2L1. Binding of RANK to BCL-2L1 leads to the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, activation of caspases and apoptosis.

Ford Park Cemetery is a  cemetery in central Plymouth, England, established by the Plymouth, Stonehouse & Devonport Cemetery Company in 1846 and opened in 1848. At the time it was outside the boundary of the Three Towns and was created to alleviate the overcrowding in the churchyards of the local parish churches. Its official name at the time of inception was The Plymouth, Devonport and Stonehouse Cemetery (renamed in 2000), although it is now seldom referred to by that title. The cemetery was originally  in size, but a further  were added in 1875. It came into use during one of the largest outbreaks of cholera in the country and during its first year it saw over 400 burials related to that disease. During Victorian times it was the main cemetery for the Three Towns, and it is estimated that approximately a quarter of a million people are buried within its grounds. The older burial records have been deposited with the Plymouth and West Devon Record Office.

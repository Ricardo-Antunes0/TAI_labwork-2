John, surnamed Mystacon, "the mustachioed", (, fl. 1st c.) was a British alchemist, astrologer, and magician of the 16th century.  Born into a noble family in the south-west of England, John Mystacon travelled extensively and studied at the universities of Padua and Louvain. He is best known for his magical works, which include a book on astrology, a treatise on the creation of magical creatures, and a compilation of magical spells.  Mystacon also practiced alchemy, and is credited with developing a process for making gold from base metals. His work was highly respected by his contemporaries, and he is considered one of the most important British alchemists of his time. He died in 1571 at the age of 67.

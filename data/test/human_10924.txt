KCPQ, virtual and VHF digital channel 13, is a Fox owned-and-operated television station serving Seattle, Washington, United States, that is licensed to Tacoma. Owned by the Fox Television Stations subsidiary of Fox Corporation, it is part of a duopoly with Seattle-licensed MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station KZJO (channel 22). Both stations share studios on Westlake Avenue in Seattle's Westlake neighborhood, while KCPQ's main transmitter is located on Gold Mountain in Bremerton. A hard-luck independent station for its first two decades of broadcasting as KMO-TV and KTVW, the station was bought out of bankruptcy by the Clover Park School District in 1975, became KCPQ, and operated noncommercially for four years. It was sold back to commercial interests in 1980 and rebuilt itself as a competitive independent and Fox affiliate. Fox acquired the station in 2019 after more than two decades of overtures and other attempts to own a station in the Seattle market.

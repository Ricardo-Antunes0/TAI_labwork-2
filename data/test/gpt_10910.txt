William Tudor (January 28, 1779March 9, 1830) was a Welshman who became the first monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and the first Roman Catholic monarch in England.  Born in Pembroke, Wales, he was the son of Henry VII, king of England, and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon. On November 29, 1789, he became the first Roman Catholic monarch of England when he was crowned on Westminster Abbey's thrones as William IV. In 1801, he married Caroline of Brunswick, who bore him six children.  In 1809, he succeeded his father as King of Great Britain and Ireland. His reign saw many constitutional changes in the United Kingdom, such as the Act of Union 1800 which merged the two kingdoms into a single entity; this led to increased political tension with Ireland. In 1812, war broke out with France over the Napoleonic Wars. The British were victorious at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, but Napoleon was later defeated and exiled to Elba. William died in 1830 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Edward VII.

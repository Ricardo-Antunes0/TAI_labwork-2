The Bulgarian National Front (Bulgarian:Български Национален Фронт (Bulgarski natsionalen front)  or BNF) is an anti-communist political movement active amongst emigrant Bulgarian populations. The group, which is active in a number of countries but not in Bulgaria itself, has been characterised as far-right and a continuation of earlier fascist movements. Organisation The BNF was formed in Munich, Germany in 1947 by Bulgarians living in exile in the city under the leadership of Ivan Dochev. The group's stated aim was to oppose communism in Bulgaria and influence western opinion against the communist regime, whilst also seeking to build up activism amongst émigrés. The group's membership was mostly made up of former members of the Union of Bulgarian National Legions, many of whom had collaborated with Nazi Germany. Before long the BNF had established branches in the United States, Western Europe and South America as well as Dochev's base of Canada. Their main journal was Svoboda, a multilingual publication which first appeared in Germany in 1959 before moving to Canada in 1970.

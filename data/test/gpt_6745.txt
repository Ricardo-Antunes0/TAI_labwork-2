The phalanx (; plural phalanxes or phalanges, from φάλαγξ phalágkŭ, "finger") was a formation of heavy infantry used by the ancient Greeks and Macedonians. It consisted of several rows of soldiers who stood side by side, with their shields locked together to form a protective wall. This allowed them to form a long line and make better use of their spears, which were effectively ranged weapons.   The phalanx was used in close combat and was the standard formation of the hoplite infantry. The phalanx was relatively easy to form and required little training, making it a popular choice for armies that lacked money or resources to train their troops. The phalanx could be formed on open ground or against walls and could move quickly and protect itself from enemy attack. However, the formation was vulnerable to being flanked and depended on its cohesion to remain effective.

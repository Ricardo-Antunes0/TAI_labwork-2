In computer network protocol design, inter-server communication is the exchange of messages between servers in a network.  Inter-server communication is an important part of many network protocols, and can be used for a variety of purposes. It can be used to coordinate the execution of tasks across several servers, to provide information to servers about the state of other servers, and to provide messages between clients and servers.

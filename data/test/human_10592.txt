Biography Little is concretely known about Crump's early life, although it is known that he was born in Richmond to Johanna and Josiah Crump around 1838. It is also unknown whether he was born enslaved or free, but records have him marked as "free" by 1860, when he was living in Richmond with his mother and her new husband, James Robinson. Crump was employed for a time hauling freight until 1871, when he began working with the postal system. On December 19, 1883, he married Fernella Meriweather, with whom he had three children. In his later life Crump opened a grocery store.

Digital planar holography (DPH) is a method for recording and displaying three-dimensional images on a two-dimensional surface. DPH is a variant of holography, which uses light to create an image that appears three-dimensional. DPH uses a digital camera to capture the object or scene being displayed, and then uses a special computer program to manipulate the light waves that create the image.

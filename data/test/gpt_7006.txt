Charles Aubrey "Mickey" LeMaistre (February 10, 1924 – September 8, 2009) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player who played 14 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Boston Bruins, Detroit Red Wings, and New York Rangers. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1978.  LeMaistre was born in Trois-Rivières, Quebec. After playing junior hockey for the Trois-Rivières Dukes, he joined the Bruins organization as a teenager and made his NHL debut in 1947. LeMaistre became one of the Bruins' most consistent players over the next decade, playing on three Stanley Cup-winning teams (1950, 1951, 1952). He also represented Canada at the 1952 Winter Olympics.  In 1957, LeMaistre was traded to the Red Wings where he spent the remainder of his career. He won another Stanley Cup with Detroit in 1960 and retired after the 1964–65 season. LeMaistre then moved to New York to become head coach of the Rangers, leading them to their first playoff appearance in 21 years in 1974–75. He retired from coaching after two seasons and returned to Montreal where he died in 2009 at age 89.

Quantum crystallography is a branch of crystallography that uses quantum mechanical principles to study the structure of crystals. It is a very versatile and powerful method for investigating the way that atoms and molecules are arranged in crystals, and can be used to identify the crystal structure of substances that are difficult or impossible to crystallize using other methods.  Quantum crystallography is based on the principle that crystals are made up of individual atoms or molecules that are arranged in a specific way. This arrangement is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, and can be described in terms of the quantum state of the individual atoms or molecules. By measuring the quantum state of individual atoms or molecules, it is possible to determine the crystal structure of a substance.  The main advantage of quantum crystallography over other methods is its versatility. Other methods can be used to study specific types of crystals, but quantum crystallography can be used to study any type of crystal, regardless of its composition. This makes it particularly useful for studying substances that are difficult or impossible to crystallize using other methods.  Another advantage of quantum crystallography is its accuracy. Unlike other methods, which rely on approximations and assumptions, quantum crystallography is based on rigorous mathematical calculations. This makes it a very reliable method for investigating the structure of crystals.  One potential limitation of quantum crystallography is its sensitivity to environmental factors. If the conditions under which the crystal was grown are not correct, then the crystal structure will not be correct, and measurements made using quantum crystallography will be inaccurate

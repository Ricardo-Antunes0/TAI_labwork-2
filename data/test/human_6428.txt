The Hale Koa Hotel, which means House of the Warrior in Hawaiian, is an Armed Forces Recreation Center (AFRC) resort hotel located on Waikiki Beach and owned by the United States Department of Defense. It sits on the southeast corner of Fort DeRussy on the western end of Waikiki in Honolulu. The hotel has more than one million guests every year, all of whom require the United States Uniformed Services Privilege and Identification Card to lodge at the hotel. Though owned by the DOD, the hotel is entirely self-sustaining, and does not receive any government funding. History  The hotel was originally planned to be built on the site of Battery Randolph in the early 1970s, but the battery proved to be too resilient to demolish. The hotel opened at Waikiki beach on October 25, 1975, with a traditional Hawaiian ceremony. A major expansion came in 1991. The hotel added a new pool, a beverage bar, and a luau garden. Later, the Maile tower was built across the lobby from the Ilima tower, bringing the total number of rooms to 818. Also constructed was an adults-only pool, a fitness center, a parking garage, and Bibas, a new caf√© located on a porch underneath the Maile tower. The Ilima tower was fully renovated in 2010, as was the Maile tower in 2019, and a new ocean-side pool complex replaced the hotel's original pool.

A UIMID (user identity module identifier) is a unique identifier for a user in an online environment. It is typically a user's login name or email address, but may also be other identifying information such as a social security number.  UIMIDs are used in a variety of contexts, including for logging into websites, registering for services, and making purchases on the web. They are also used to keep track of which websites a user has visited and for other purposes.  UIMIDs are typically generated automatically by a website or service when a user signs in or registers. They can also be generated automatically when a user makes a purchase or fills out a form on the web.  Some websites and services allow users to customize their UIMID by entering an alternate login name or email address. This can help users keep their accounts separate if they have multiple accounts with the same website or service.

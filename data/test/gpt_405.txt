The Sheibani Network is an Iraqi smuggling network active in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The network was responsible for smuggling goods, including weapons, across the Iraqi-Syrian border.  The Sheibani Network was first identified in late 2007 by the United States Department of State. At the time, the network was smuggling goods, including weapons, across the Iraqi-Syrian border. By early 2010, however, federal prosecutors in the United States began to focus on the network as part of an effort to dismantle Baghdad's trafficking networks.  In March 2010, U.S. federal prosecutors announced their indictment of twenty-four individuals associated with the Sheibani Network. The defendants included both Iraqi and Syrian nationals. The indictment charged the defendants with various offenses, including conspiracy to smuggle weapons and ammunition into Iraq and Syria, conspiracy to defraud the United States government, and money laundering.  The Sheibani Network is believed to have been active until at least early 2011. In February 2011, U.S. federal prosecutors announced their indictment of six additional individuals associated with the network. The defendants included both Iraqi and Syrian nationals.

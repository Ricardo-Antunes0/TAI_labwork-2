Truth of Truths - a Contemporary Rock Opera is a 1971 two-disc Christian rock album which was largely conceived by promoter/producer Ray Ruff. The album is arranged as a rock opera based on significant events in the Christian Bible, with the first two sides pertaining to the Old Testament and two to the New Testament. The album has a black cover with a white title and a gold Star of David and Cross. It comes with a 17-page booklet with lyrics and biblical references for each of the songs. The double LP was substantially co-written with former Them bassist Alan Henderson, and with Val St√∂ecklein, formerly of The Blue Things (whose most famous song "Orange Rooftops Of Your Mind" is re-recorded here with new lyrics as "John the Baptist"). Both bands had been managed by Ray Ruff. Donnie Brooks plays Christ. Actor Jim Backus plays the spoken voice of God.

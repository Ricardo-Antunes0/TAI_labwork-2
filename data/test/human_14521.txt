Pterostylis nana, commonly known as the dwarf snail orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to Australia. It has a rosette of leaves at it base and a single narrow, bright green and white flower with a small labellum. There is uncertainty about its classification - some sources include South Australia and Western Australia in its range. Description Pterostylis nana is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a rosette of egg-shaped to heart-shaped leaves, each leaf 5–20 mm long and 3–10 mm wide. A single bright green and white flower, 10–15 mm long and 4–5 mm wide is borne on a stalk 50–150 mm high. The dorsal sepal is erect, more or less flat on top and fused to the petals forming a hood or "galea" over the column.  The lateral sepals are erect, in close contact with the galea and taper to a thread-like tip about 20 mm long.  The sinus between the lateral sepals is more or less flat and has a dark green central area. The labellum is 3–5 mm long, about 2 mm wide, straight, blunt and hidden inside the flower. Flowering occurs from July to October.

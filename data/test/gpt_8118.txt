Captain (; also known by its tagline, "A modern day adventure") is a 2019 American action thriller film directed by Peter Berg and written by Max Landis. It is based on the 2012 novel of the same name by Charlie Higson. The film stars Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, and Chris Pratt.  Captain tells the story of Nick Walker (Evans), a desk-bound CIA officer who is abruptly thrust into the role of field agent when he's called upon to lead a team of specialists on a dangerous mission to capture or kill a rogue agent (Pratt) who has been waging a global war against the United States.   Berg, who directed 2009's Hancock and the 2014 disaster film Lone Survivor, was initially hesitant to take on Captain due to its high-risk nature. However, he was convinced to direct the film by Paramount Pictures chairman Brad Grey and producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Principal photography began in March 2018 in London and concluded in July 2018.  Captain was released in the United States on July 20, 2019, and grossed over $248 million worldwide. The critical response was mixed, but Evans' performance was praised.

Gulf Publishing Company is an international publishing and events business dedicated to the hydrocarbon energy sector. In mid-2018 it rebranded as Gulf Energy Information.  Founded in 1916 by Ray Lofton Dudley, Gulf Energy Information produces and distributes publications in print and web formats, online news, webcasts and databases; hosts conferences and events designed for the energy industry. The company was a subsidiary of Euromoney Institutional Investor from 2001 until a 2016 management buyout by CEO John Royall and Texas investors. The business and strategy publication Petroleum Economist also transferred to the company in May 2016.   In mid-2017 the company acquired 109-year old Oildom Publishing.  The company's flagship magazines, World Oil, Hydrocarbon Processing, Pipeline & Gas Journal, and the Petroleum Economist are published monthly. Gulf is headquartered in Houston, Texas, with sales staff and columnists around the world, due to expansion efforts by William G. Dudley, Sr. The Petroleum Economist publishing and map cartography staff are based in London, UK. Gulf Energy Info's Data Services staff support on-line Energy Web Atlas energy data visualization, and Construction Boxscore downstream project database, from Houston, London and Mumbai.

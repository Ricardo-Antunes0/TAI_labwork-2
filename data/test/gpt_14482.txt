Benford's law, also known as the Newcombâ€“Benford law, is a statistical law that states that the relative frequency of characters in a sequence such as a list, table, or text is approximately in proportion to the sum of their first digits.  The law was first proposed by American physicist Frank Benford in 1937. It has been found to hold true for a wide range of data sets, including natural numbers, letters, and even random binary sequences.

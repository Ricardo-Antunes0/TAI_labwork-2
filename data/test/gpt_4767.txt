Midi Olympique is a French bi-weekly newspaper, published in the suburbs of Paris.  Midi Olympique was founded on 22 February 1944 by the journalist and author Fran√ßois Mauriac. The paper is one of the oldest French newspapers still in circulation. It is considered to be a conservative newspaper with a centrist point of view.  Midi Olympique has had a long history of supporting the French sports system. The paper has been critical of certain reforms, such as the abolition of professional sports leagues, but has also defended the French Olympic Committee and its policies. It has also been supportive of certain French sportsmen, such as Roland-Garros champion Yannick Noah.  The paper has had a number of editors over the years, most notably Roger Salengro and Alain Peyrefitte. The current editor-in-chief is Philippe Val.

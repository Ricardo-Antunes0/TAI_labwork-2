John E. Mullally (October 22, 1874 - January 15, 1912) was a state legislator in California. He was elected to the California State Assembly from the Thirtieth District in San Francisco in the general election of 1910.  His service was cut short on January 15, 1912 when three disguised soldiers from the Presidio, who had been conducting a string of robberies, chose the saloon he owned at 116 Eighth Street as their next target.  Mullally attempted to resist, and each of the three shot him.  His bartender exchanged gunfire with the three, who fled with $87.  Mullally's wife, and brother James, a fireman at a neighboring station, stayed with him until an ambulance took him to a nearby hospital, where he died while anesthesia was being administered. Mullally was born in San Francisco the third son and sixth child of John Mullally and Ellen Lannen Mullally. He attended public schools and St. Joseph College.

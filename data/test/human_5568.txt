Dain Ba Enkh (Mongolian: War and Peace) is one of the first hip hop groups established in Mongolia in 1997. In its beginning, it consisted of Mcit, Mc Aav, Bizi, Ezi, Ikser (XR) and Khoron. Writing all their songs themselves and composing them of "highly necessary words", they engaged with political and social matters right from the beginning. They won the competition of Radio 107.5 in the category Best Newcomer with their song "Zogsoltgüi" ("Eternal"). They have published two albums, Ödör tutam (From Day to Day) (1999), being the first hip-hop album published in Mongolia, and Neg chigt (To One Direction) (2001). When Mcit quit the band in 2002, it became quiet around the band, but its activities didn't completely cease, e.g. they published the song "76" (which is the number of seats in the Mongolian parliament) together with Ice Top, a leading hip-hop band of Mongolia in the first decade of the 21st century.

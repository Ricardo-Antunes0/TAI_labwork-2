The Tyndale Monument  is a tower built on a hill at North Nibley, Gloucestershire, England. It was built in honour of William Tyndale, an early translator of the New Testament into English, who was born nearby. It is a Grade II* listed building. The tower was constructed in 1866 and is 111Â ft (34 m) tall. It is possible to enter and climb to the top of the tower, up a spiral staircase of 121 steps. The hill it is on allows a wide range of views, especially looking down to the River Severn. A nearby topograph points to some other landmarks visible. The hill on which the monument stands is quite steep. The path follows a rough fairly steep bridleway which is part of the Cotswold Way. The tower itself is surrounded by fencing and has floodlights that light up the tower at night. The stairway has automatic lighting. The Cotswold Way long-distance footpath passes the foot of the monument, and then descends the hill into North Nibley.

A lithosphere ( [] for "rocky", and -sphere from Ancient Greek: λιθοσπάρτης, lithos "stone") is a solid outermost layer of the Earth's mantle. It has a relatively low melting point and is made up of solidified magma, rocks and dust. The lithosphere is divided into the upper, or crust, and the lower, or mantle. The lithosphere is under the Earth's surface.  The lithosphere is broken into tectonic plates that move on the Earth's surface. The rocks in the lithosphere are subject to weathering and erosion. The lithosphere is broken into plates by earthquakes and volcanoes. The plates move along the Earth's surface along fault lines. The lithosphere is recycled through volcanic activity and plate tectonics.

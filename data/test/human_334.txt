Sarajevo is a 2014 German-Austrian biographical television film that depicts the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. Plot  On 28 June 1914, the Austro-Hungarian heir presumptive Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Este and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg are travelling through Sarajevo on the 525th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo. As a result of the first attack on the Archduke's life, the Austrian examining magistrate Leo Pfeffer is given the task of capturing the person responsible for the attack. Whilst interrogating the assassin, Pfeffer finds out there has been a second attack on the Archduke and his spouse, in which both are killed. Bosnian Serb assassin Gavrilo Princip is then arrested for his part in the second attack. The magistrate learns that only 36 policemen had been available for patrolling the route the Archduke was travelling on. And after the first attack, the convoy headed towards the hospital, but an apparent false turn led to the second attack, where the second attacker was located.  All of this causes doubts in Pfeffer's mind. Whilst being tortured, one of the perpetrator's confesses, and then evidence and witnesses disappear. In the process of his investigations, Pfeffer encounters further inconsistencies, but is forced by his superiors to state the assassination as a conspiracy by Serbia. As Pfeffer turns in his final report to close the film, it is accepted by his superior apathetically, as Austro-Hungarian politicians and military have already decided the assassination of the Archduke would be used as a pretext for an attack on Serbia.

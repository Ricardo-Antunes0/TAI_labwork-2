Bogoslof Island or Agasagook Island  is a volcanic island in the Baffin Islands of Nunavut, Canada, located in the eastern Arctic Ocean. The island is long and narrow, with a maximum width of only 5.4 km. Bogoslof Island is the largest island in the Baffin Islands archipelago.  The island is named after Bogoslof Strait, which separates it from Greenland. The strait is named after Pieter Bogenschutz, a Dutch whaler who explored it in 1614. Bogoslof Island was first sighted by Europeans on July 30, 1596 by Giovanni da Verrazzano. In 1913, the Canadian Arctic Expedition led by Robert Peary landed on the island and claimed it for Canada.  Bogoslof Island is home to a colony of ptarmigan, as well as caribou, polar bears, seals and walruses. It is also the site of an abandoned Russian military base, which was used during World War II to supply the Soviet Union with materials and personnel for its operations in North America.

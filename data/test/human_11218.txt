Righeira were an Italian Italo disco duo formed in Turin in 1983. The duo consisted of Stefano Righi (lead vocals and keyboards) and Stefano Rota (backing vocals and keyboards). Originally rooted in the early stages of Italo disco music, Righeira's musical style evolved throughout their career, incorporating elements of synth-pop and new wave in their songs in innovative ways, later exploring music styles such as electronic music and regular pop, yet maintaining the quality built on Righi's deep and expressive vocals backed up by Rota's lighter vocals. Gaining popularity for their extraordinary style, the duo have staged several performances in popular night clubs and music festivals throughout the years. The duo was formed when the members wanted to revolutionize the music industry with their futuristic sound, after attending the Albert Einstein Scientific High School as schoolmates, and striving after performing together on stage. Within the first months of their career, they signed with several record labels and released their debut album, Righeira (1983). With the release of the album, and the singles "Vamos a la playa" and "No Tengo Dinero", Righeira established their reputation as a modern dance duo. In the mid-1980s, they were once again highlighted in public after the release of the single "L'estate sta finendo", a popular song among young people, and their winning performance at the Festivalbar singing competition in 1985. The duo's second album, Bambini Forever (1986), earned less success in public when it was released but included songs as "Italians a Go-Go", "Oasi In Citt√†" and "Innamoratissimo", with which they performed at the Sanremo Music Festival in 1986.

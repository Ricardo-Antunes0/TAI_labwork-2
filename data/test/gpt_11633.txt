Boogie (sometimes called post-disco and electro-funk) is a subgenre of funk music characterized by a heavy beat, syncopated basslines and electric guitars.  Boogie was first developed in the late 1970s in the Detroit area by artists such as James Brown, Funkadelic and the Parliament-Funkadelic collective. It became popular in the early 1980s club scene and has since become a mainstay of funk music.

A Gŵyl Mabsant (Welsh for "Feast of the Virgin Mary") is a festival celebrated on the first Sunday of August in Wales and in Cornwall, England.  The Gŵyl Mabsant originated in medieval times as a way to honour the Blessed Virgin Mary. It is now a national holiday in Wales and Cornwall, and is also celebrated in other parts of the United Kingdom. The main celebrations take place in communities around the two countries, with processions and religious services followed by a feast. There are also various cultural events, including plays, music concerts and exhibitions.

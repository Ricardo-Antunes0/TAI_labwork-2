Tingena perichlora is a species of moth in the family Oecophoridae. It is endemic to New Zealand and has been observed in the southern parts of the South Island. This species appears to inhabit manuka scrub. Adults of this species are on the wing from October to January. Taxonomy  This species was first described by Edward Meyrick in 1907 using specimens collected by Alfred Philpott in Invercargill in November and December and named Borkhausenia perichlora. In 1915 Meyrick discussed this species under that name. In 1926 Alfred Philpott discussed and illustrated the genitalia of the male of this species and stated that he could not detect any difference in the genitalia between this species and T. chloradelpha. Philpott went on to hypothesise that the two species may possibly be the northern and southern varieties of the same species as they only show difference in colour charachteristics.  In 1928 George Hudson discussed and illustrated this species in his book The butterflies and moths of New Zealand. In 1988 J. S. Dugdale placed this species within the genus Tingena. The male lectotype is held at the Natural History Museum, London.

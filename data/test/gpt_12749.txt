The Great Iwan  was a monumental building project of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I (527-565), which was intended as a monument to commemorate his victory over the Vandals in 533. The work was begun in 548 and completed in 562, after more than a decade of construction.  The Great Iwan was one of the largest and most ambitious projects undertaken by Justinian I and is considered to be one of the most significant achievements of his reign. It was an enormous undertaking, taking up an entire square kilometer of land at the northeasterly edge of Constantinople and comprising more than 1,000 rooms on six levels. The building was decorated with a vast array of mosaics, paintings, and sculptures, many commissioned by Justinian himself.  The Great Iwan is now one of the most popular tourist destinations in Constantinople, with visitors able to walk through its halls and see its various artworks. It remains one of the most impressive examples of Byzantine architecture and has been described as "one of the wonders of the world".

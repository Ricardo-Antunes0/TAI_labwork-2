Baikuris is an extinct genus of antilopine cervids that lived during the late Eocene epoch (46.3—33.9 mya) in North America. The type species, Baikuria baikuriensis, was described by J.D. Whitney in 1915. Baikuris is the only genus in the family Baikuridini and the only antilopine cervid to have been described from North America.  Baikuris is known from a single specimen, a skull and vertebrae that were recovered from the Wheeler Ranch Formation of western Texas. The specimen is currently housed at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. The Wheeler Ranch Formation is a sedimentary deposit that dates to the late Eocene epoch, approximately 46.3—33.9 mya.  Baikuris is one of the oldest antilopine cervids known from North America and has been classified as part of the family Baikuridini, which is composed of four other genera: Baikuria, Bison antiquus, Bison latifrons, and Sinocerus. Baikuria and Baikuris are the only two genera in the family and are differentiated based on their cranial features. Baikuria has a more robust cranial architecture and a taller skull than Baikuris.  The only known specimen of Baikuris was recovered from a sedimentary deposit that dates to the late Eocene

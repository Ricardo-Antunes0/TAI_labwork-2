Reel Moments (sometimes Glamour Reel Moments or Glamour's Reel Moments) is an annual film series project by the magazine Glamour. The program entails a competition where its readers submit short stories with three being selected to be made into short films. The short stories submitted are all personal non-fiction essays. Actors, directors, and crew all donate their time to the project. Sponsors fund scripting, production, and screening costs. Proceeds benefit a charity chosen by each director, such as FilmAid International. It is hoped that the directing experience will open doors for female directors. Each film is directed by a woman, often a celebrity. As of 2011, 20 films have been produced through the program, including giving directorial debuts to Jennifer Aniston, Jessica Biel, Courteney Cox, Kirsten Dunst, Bryce Dallas Howard, Kate Hudson, Eva Mendes, Demi Moore, and Rachel Weisz. The films are also matched up with female talent throughout the production process, including actresses. Objectives of the project include empowering women by producing female-friendly short films while creating opportunities for actresses to direct and extending the Glamour brand.

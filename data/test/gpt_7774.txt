Light-induced voltage alteration (LIVA) is a semiconductor process that alters the electrical characteristics of a material by inducing a voltage in the material, which can be used to control and manipulate the material properties. LIVA is a type of photovoltaic (PV) technology.  LIVA technology uses light to induce a voltage in a semiconductor material, which can be used to control and manipulate the material properties. LIVA can be used to create solar cells, LEDs, lasers, and other types of devices. LIVA technology is growing rapidly because it is an easy way to create strong, controllable voltages with minimal damage to the material.

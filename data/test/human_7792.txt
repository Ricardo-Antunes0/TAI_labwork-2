Clear Marie Rivers is a fictional character from the Final Destination film series. Created by Jeffrey Reddick and portrayed by Ali Larter, the character first appeared in Final Destination (2000) as a high school senior who, after surviving a plane explosion foreseen by Alex Browning, assists him on "cheating Death" by rescuing the other survivors from their impending doom. Clear returns in the sequel Final Destination 2 (2003), where she aids Kimberly Corman in saving the new set of victims from the Route 23 pile-up. The character also appears in the novelizations of the two motion pictures. Created by Reddick, Clear was further developed by James Wong and Glen Morgan to be "the loner of the group" and a girl who's insecure about her sex appeal and tries to hide it with a gothic appearance. Larter described her as someone who's suffered from many losses in her life, causing her to close off from other people. Clear's death occurs in the second installment of the franchise, where she was fatally incinerated in an oxygenated explosion.

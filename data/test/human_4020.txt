In German folklore, a drude (, pl. Druden) is a kind of malevolent nocturnal spirit (an elf (Alp) or kobold or a hag) associated with nightmares, prevalent especially in Southern Germany.  Druden were said to participate in the Wild Hunt and were considered a particular class of demon in Alfonso de Spina's hierarchy. The word also came to be used as a generic term for "witch" in the 16th century (Hans Sachs). The word is attested as Middle High German trute,  In early modern lexicography and down to the 19th century, it was popularly associated with the word druid, without any etymological justification.  Its actual origin is unknown. Jacob Grimm suggests derivation from a euphemistic trût  (modern traut) "dear, beloved; intimate", but cites as an alternative suggestion a relation to the valkyrie's name Þrúðr.  If so it is natural to connect the druden with the daughter of the chieftain of the gods in the Norse religion, Thor, and his wife Sif.

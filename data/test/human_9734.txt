Partner relationship management (PRM), used especially in IT industries, is a system of methodologies, strategies, software, and web-based capabilities which help a vendor to manage partner relationships. The general purpose of PRM is to enable vendors to better manage their partners through the introduction of reliable systems, processes and procedures for interacting with them. Web-based PRM systems typically include a content Management System, a partner and customer contact database, and the notion of a partner portal which allows partners to log in and interact with a vendor's sales opportunity database and obtain product, pricing, and training information. This helps vendors to streamline processes, as well as to collect and assess data about various stages of the partner sales funnel. There are a number of solution providers who offer PRM software to companies who rely heavily on a PRM solution to stay relevant in their respective industries. Vendors who implement a PRM solution are typically motivated by a need to reduce the financial overhead, automate regular processes, and establish new partnerships to drive channel revenue and scale. Partners may also be integrators or managed service providers. Unlike customer relationship management systems, which are tailored toward getting an end customer to purchase from you, a PRM system is focused on getting a partner to sell on your behalf. As a result, they commonly offer web-based self-service tools, information, and resources to partner resellers. Tools often include:  Market development funds Request Programs  Training, Certification, and Accreditation Automation  Deal Registration Programs, under which vendors register the partner who has brought them a potential deal with a qualified prospect as their intended or preferred channel for a subsequent sale   Indirect Sales Pipeline Reporting  Joint Business Planning  Reward and Loyalty Programs  Content Library

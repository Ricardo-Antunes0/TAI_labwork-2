"Le Mondain" ("The Worldling" or "The Man of Mode") is a 1668 novel by Fran√ßois Rabelais. It is often seen as the high watermark of the French Renaissance and one of the greatest French novels.  The book is written in iambic pentameter and tells the story of Pantagruel, a giant and the eponymous worldling, who travels through France and Italy in search of knowledge and entertainment. Along the way he meets a variety of people, from kings and queens to commoners and animals, all of whom he interacts with in his outrageous fashion.  The novel has been enormously influential, not only in its own time but also on later writers. It has been praised for its brilliant comedy, its exploration of human nature, and its depiction of French society at the time.

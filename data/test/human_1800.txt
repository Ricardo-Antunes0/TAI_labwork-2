Lady Carla (8 March 1993 â€“ 2012) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare best known for winning The Oaks in 1996. In a racing career which lasted from October 1995 to July 1997 the filly ran six times and won three races. After winning her only race as a two-year-old, Lady Carla won the Listed Oaks Trial Stakes at Lingfield Park on her three-year-old debut. Four weeks later she maintained her unbeaten run in the Classic Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom, winning by nine lengths. She was beaten when favourite for the Irish Oaks and finished unplaced in two races the following season before being retired to stud. Background Lady Carla was a bay mare with a white star, bred by the Meon Valley Stud in Hampshire, England. Her sire, Caerleon, won the Prix du Jockey Club and the Benson & Hedges Gold Cup in 1983 and went on to become an "excellent" stallion, siring the winners of more than 700 races including Generous, Cape Verdi, Marienbard and Warrsan. Lady Carla's dam, Shirley Superstar, won one minor race and produced no other important winners, but was a daughter of the Nassau Stakes runner-up Odeon. As a descendant of the French broodmare Democratie, she was related to the Oaks winners Juliette Marny and Scintillate as well as the St Leger winner Julio Mariner, the Nunthorpe Stakes winner Matatina and the Middle Park Stakes winner Showdown.

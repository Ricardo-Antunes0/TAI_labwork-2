The Makkah Declaration (2019) also known as the Charter of Makkah, is a document that was endorsed on 28 May 2019 in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Its creation was largely conceived and realized by the Muslim World League and it was presented by Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. It was written to create a pan-Islamic set of principles that supported anti-extremism, religious and cultural diversity, and legislation against hate and violence. The document was declared at the end of the four-day conference organized by the Muslim World League conference in Makkah. It was approved by Islamic leaders of 139 countries and signed by around 1,200 prominent Muslim figures. Background  In August 2016 Dr. Muhammad Al-Issa became Secretary General of the Muslim World League. Under Dr. Al-Issaâ€™s direction, the MWL has been widely recognized as one of the leading organizations in Saudi Arabia dedicated to combating extremist ideology. As part of this mission, the MWL has worked to build relations with leaders from other faiths, and to build a consensus across the various denominations of Islam rejecting extremism, fundamentalism, and violence.

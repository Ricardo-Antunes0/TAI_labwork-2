Lucinda Urrusti (born 1929) is a Mexican artist, whose work has gained fame not only from the writing of art critics, but also by poets and writers from other fields, such as Carlos Fuentes. She was born to a Spanish family which came to Mexico in 1939 to escape the Spanish Civil War and has remained in Mexico since. Urrustia is a part of Mexico’s Generación de la Ruptura, a group of artists that broke with the dominant Mexican muralism of the first half of the 20th century with most of her work classed as Impressionism and/or abstract. However, she is also a noted portrait artist, having depicted a number of Mexico’s elite in the arts and sciences. Life Lucinda Urrusti was born in 1929, in Melilla, Spanish Morocco, the daughter of a Republican soldier from the Basque area of Spain .  The Spanish Civil War broke out during her childhood and spent time at a camp in France along with her mother and brother. After locating her father, the family left on the first boat taking Spanish refugees to Mexico, after President Lázaro Cárdenas permitted Spanish Republican refugees to settle in the country. The family arrived in 1939.

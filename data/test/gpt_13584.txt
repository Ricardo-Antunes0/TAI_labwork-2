Paint the Night Parade is a nighttime parade and festival that takes place in the heart of downtown Orlando, Florida. Held annually on the third Saturday in December, the event features a parade of over 50 floats and marching bands, as well as interactive attractions and family-friendly activities.   Paint the Night Parade was conceived in 2009 by local business owners who wanted to create an event that would bring people together and showcase the city of Orlando at its best. Since its inception, the parade has grown into one of the region's most popular annual events, with spectators lining the streets to catch a glimpse of floats and marching bands from all over Central Florida.   This year's parade will feature more than 50 entries, including schools and community groups from throughout Central Florida. The event is free to attend and family-friendly, making it a perfect way to spend a cold winter evening.

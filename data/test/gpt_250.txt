Operation Panzerfaust  was a military operation conducted by Nazi Germany in 1944, during the Second World War. The objective of the operation was to destroy a vital bridge over the River Danube in order to cut off the Allied forces in central Europe from their supply lines.  The operation began on 15 August 1944, with a parachute drop of more than 1,000 German paratroopers onto the bridge. However, the Allied forces defending the bridge were prepared for the attack and destroyed most of the German paratroopers within minutes. This led to a series of failed attempts by the Germans to recapture the bridge, which eventually led to its destruction on 3 October 1944.

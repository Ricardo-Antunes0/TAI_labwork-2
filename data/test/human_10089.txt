John M. (Sean) Cadogan is  Professor of Physics at the University of New South Wales and a former Canada Research Chair in Advanced Materials.   Using advanced nuclear techniques, he studies the magnetic compounds formed between rare earth elements and transition elements. Materials with magnetic properties have played a central role in the development of modern technology, and are used in many every-day devices. Rare-earth materials promise magnetic properties beyond the capabilities of those used in the past and so are essential to the continued evolution and development of new technologies. They also have the potential to improve energy efficiency in applications ranging from advanced motors to new refrigeration technologies, and to reduce the environmental side effects of current technology. Cadogan also uses nuclear techniques to explore "soft-magnetic" materials based on iron and other elements, which are found in such applications as the transformer cores used by the electrical power industry

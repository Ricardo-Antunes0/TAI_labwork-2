Cellular confinement systems (CCS)—also known as geocells—are a type of closed ecological system that uses artificial cells to imitate the natural behavior of populations of microorganisms or cells in natural ecosystems.  CCS are used to study cellular behavior, to produce food or fuels, to control environmental pollution, or to produce pharmaceuticals and other chemicals. They are also used as research and development platforms for new technologies.  CCS have many applications, but they are most commonly used to study the behavior of cells in a controlled environment. Cells in CCS are often divided into small units that are isolated from each other and from the external environment. This is done to allow the cells to study their own behavior without being influenced by other cells or factors in the environment.   CCS have many advantages over traditional laboratory methods. They are more stable and reliable, allowing researchers to study cells for longer periods of time. CCS also allow researchers to study complex systems in a more controlled way, which can be difficult to do in traditional laboratory settings.

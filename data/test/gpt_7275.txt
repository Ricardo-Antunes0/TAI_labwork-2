The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) is a unionist political party in Northern Ireland. The party is one of the two major unionist parties in the province, alongside the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). It is currently the second largest party in Northern Ireland, after the DUP.  The Ulster Unionist Party was founded on 10 October 1912, by Sir Edward Carson and Sir James Craig. It first contested elections in 1921, and entered into coalition with the Conservative Party in 1924. The UUP lost its majority in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom at the 1931 general election. However, they regained it at the 1935 general election. In 1945, they formed a coalition government with the Labour Party, but this lasted for only three months. In February 1947, they withdrew from government after a dispute over civil rights.  The UUP won four seats at the 1959 general election, and entered into coalition with the Conservative Party. The coalition lasted for six years. In March 1973, there was a split in the UUP over how to respond to violence by members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). The more moderate elements left to form the Ulster Liberal Party, while the more conservative elements remained with the UUP. In December 1974, they lost their majority in parliament. In February 1975, they formed a coalition government with the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), but this also ended after three months.  The UUP won six seats at the 1979 general election, and entered into coalition with the Conservative Party

Pierre Jules Baroche (18 November 1802, Paris29 January 1881, Paris) was a French painter and printmaker, mainly of portraits.  Baroche was the son of Pierre Baroche, a well-known engraver and lithographer. He began his training in painting with his father, but soon went to study at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he was taught by François-Xavier Fabre. He exhibited for the first time at the Salon in 1830, and from then on became well-known. His portraits are often brightly coloured and lively, and often include humorous elements. He also produced a number of prints, many of which are extremely rare.  Baroche died in Paris at the age of 87.

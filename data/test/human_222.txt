The Komsomolskoye massacre occurred following the Battle of Komsomolskoye (Chechen: Saadi-Kotar) during the Second Chechen War in March 2000. A prominent feature in the incident was the fate of a group of about 72 Chechen combatants who had surrendered on 20 March on a Russian public promise of amnesty, but had almost all either died or "disappeared" shortly after they were detained. 2000 massacre According to Owen Matthews, a Newsweek correspondent who visited the ruins of Komsomolskoye soon after the end of the conflict, saw the remains of at least 11 Chechen fighters, saying "it is clear that many did not die in battle. At least one had his hands bound with heavy cable and his head was split open with a spade; another had his tongue cut out. Three others had their ears cut offâ€”a Russian soldier at the scene joked that they lost their ears 'because they'd heard too much.'"

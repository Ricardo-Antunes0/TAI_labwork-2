eHealth Ontario is the agency tasked with facilitating the development of Ontario's proposed public Electronic Health Record system.      Health Informatics in Canada is run provincially, with different provinces creating different systems, albeit sometimes under voluntary Pan-Canadian guidelines published by the federal body Canada Health Infoway. eHealth Ontario was created in September 2008 out of a merger between the Ontario Ministry of Health's electronic health program and the Smart Systems for Health Agency (SSHA), with a mandate to create electronic health records for all patients in the province by 2015.  It has been plagued by delays and its CEO was fired over a multimillion-dollar contracts scandal in 2009. eHealth Ontario was consolidated into Ontario Health in 2019. Drug Profile Viewer System The Drug Profile Viewer System tracks the prescription drug claims information of 2.5 million Ontario Drug Benefit Program and Trillium Drug Program recipients.

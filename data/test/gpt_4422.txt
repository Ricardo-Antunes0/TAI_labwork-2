A Faraday rotator is a polarization rotator that uses Faraday fields to produce a uniform rotation of the plane of polarization of light. They were first proposed by Michael Faraday in 1831, and were extensively studied in the early days of quantum mechanics.  Polarization is a property of waves that describes the orientation of their electric and magnetic fields relative to one another. The direction of the electric field is called the electric vector and the direction of the magnetic field is called the magnetic vector. Light is a wave form that consists of a series of electric and magnetic fields. The orientation of these fields determines the direction that light travels and the color that it appears to have.  Light can be thought of as a mixture of two types of waves: transverse and longitudinal waves. Transverse waves are those that travel along the width of a object, like sound waves. Longitudinal waves are those that travel through an object from one end to the other, like water waves. When light waves are combined, they form what's known as a wave packet. A wave packet consists of all the individual light waves that make up a waveform, and they can be either transverse or longitudinal.  Light can be polarized in two ways: horizontally and vertically. Horizontal polarization is when the electric field points along the horizontal axis and the magnetic field points along the vertical axis. Vertical polarization is when the electric field points up and the magnetic field points down.  Polarization rotators use Faraday fields to rotate the plane of

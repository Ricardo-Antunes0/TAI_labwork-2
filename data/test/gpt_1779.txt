Intracellular pH (pHi) is the measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the cytoplasm of a cell. Cells typically maintain a narrow range of pH within their cytoplasm, typically around 7.4. This is important for a variety of cellular processes, including protein synthesis and cell division.  The pH of a cell's cytoplasm is determined by the balance between the activity of the cells' proton pumps and the concentration of acids and bases present in the cell. The proton pumps are proteins that catalyze the transfer of protons from the extracellular medium into the cell. The extracellular medium consists of water, electrolytes, and dissolved ions. These ions can be either acids (hydrogen ions) or bases (sodium ions, potassium ions, and calcium ions).  The concentration of acids and bases in the cytoplasm is controlled by two factors: the activity ofthe cellular proton pumps and the concentrations of these ions in the extracellular medium. The proton pumps are activated by an increase in voltage (i.e., an increase in electrical potential) across their membrane. This increase in voltage causes the proton pumps to break down ATP and convert it into protons. The protons then enter into the cell through the ion channel proteins and cause a change in pH.  The pH of a cell can be adjusted by changing either the activity or concentration ofthe proton pumps or by adding acids or bases to the extracellular medium

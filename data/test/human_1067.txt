Mihail Gheorghiu Bujor (November 8, 1881 – June 17, 1964) was a Romanian lawyer, journalist and socialist militant. An important figure in the early Romanian labour movement, he embraced communism during World War I and organised Romanian armed detachments in Odessa in support of the October Revolution, hoping to foment a revolution in his native country. A political prisoner in Romania for much of the interwar period and during World War II, he held several minor political offices after the regime change in the late 1940s. Early life Mihail Gh. Bujor was born in Iași, the sixth child of Gheorghe Gheorghiu, a civil servant. The family was somewhat influential in the city, affording the luxury to provide adequate education for all of the twelve children. Three of children died from tuberculosis, followed shortly by the parents while Mihail was in his teen years. The quick succession of deaths is credited with transforming Mihail into an atheist.

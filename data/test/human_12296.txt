Märkische Union was a German newspaper, founded as the last CDU daily newspaper for Brandenburg, founded on February 3, 1948 with a license from SMAD. The news agency ADN reported the approval of the "occupying power" and named the newspaper title Märkische Union and Potsdam as the place of publication. The newspaper first appeared only three times a week. The then chairman of the CDU in the state of Brandenburg, Wilhelm Wolff, wrote in the first edition of the Märkische Union that Germany's unity remains the top priority. The first publishing director was the deputy CDU state chairman from Brandenburg and, from November 1948, the first chairman of this bloc party in the state of Brandenburg, Karl Grobbel. The first editor-in - chief was Hans-Werner Gyßling and remained so until February 1949. From 1948 to 1950, Xaver Kugler was an editor at Märkische Union, who was previously a volunteer under Gyßling at the CDU newspaper Der Demokratie in Schwerin.

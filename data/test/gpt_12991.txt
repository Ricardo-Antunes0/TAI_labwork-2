Racial antisemitism is prejudice against Jews based on their ethnicity or national origin. The term was first used in the 1930s to describe discrimination against Jews in Nazi Germany.  Racial antisemitism has been described as a form of bigotry, hatred, and prejudice against Jews as an ethnic group. It is often expressed through stereotypes, hatred, and negative perceptions of Jews. Racial antisemitism can also involve the use of racist language to attack Jews.  There is evidence that racial antisemitism is widespread throughout the world. In some countries, such as France and Hungary, there has been a history of anti-Semitic violence and policies directed against the Jewish community. In other countries, such as the United States, there has been a history of prejudice and discrimination against Jews but no significant incidents of violence or hate crimes against them.  Racial antisemitism has been condemned by the international community. The United Nations General Assembly has passed resolutions condemning it as a form of racism. Numerous countries have enacted laws and regulations to combat it.

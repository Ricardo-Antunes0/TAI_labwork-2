The Turtles are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1965. The group, whose best-known lineup included Howard Kaylan, Al Nichol, Mark Volman, Chuck Portz, Jim Tucker and Don Murray, had several Top 40 hits beginning in 1965 with their cover version of Bob Dylan's "It Ain't Me Babe". Originally formed as a surf band, The Turtles first achieved success with a sound which fused folk and rock and roll. The band would achieve greater success performing pop music. They scored their biggest and best-known hit in 1967 with the song "Happy Together". After they waned commercially, beginning in late 1968, and many conflicts with their label, White Whale, the band broke up in 1970. Kaylan and Volman later found long-lasting success as session musicians, billed as Flo & Eddie. In 2010, a reconstituted version of the band, "the Turtles Featuring Flo & Eddie", began performing live shows again.

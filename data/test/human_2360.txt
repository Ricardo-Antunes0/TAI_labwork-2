Pascal Bedrossian (born 28 November 1974) is a French-Armenian professional footballer who currently is head coach at Chicago Fire's Academy. Career Born in Marseille, France, Bedrossian began his playing career for the Under-15 French national team, representing them to the Under-21 level. He then played club football on the youth squad of AS Cannes in 1993, and played in the same youth squad that produced the likes of David Jemmali, Patrick Vieira, and Johan Micoud. After enjoying spells with AS Cannes and Stade Rennais, Bedrossian was involved in two relegation campaigns and one promotion campaign to Ligue 1 for Lorient, and, more prominently, was a member of the Lorient squad that won the 2002 Coupe de France, the team's first and only championship in the history of the tournament. Later that year, Bedrossian appeared in both legs in Lorient's UEFA Cup exit from qualification at the hands of Turkish side Denizlispor, losing 3â€“3 on aggregate. In 2004, Bedrossian joined Ligue 2 side Angers SCO. At the end of that campaign, he suffered an injury that has kept him away from football for the 2005 season. He then signed with the American side Chicago Fire.

Grays (or Grays Thurrock) is the largest town in the borough and unitary authority of Thurrock in Essex, England, former civil parish and one of Thurrock's traditional (Church of England) parishes. The town, on the north bank of the River Thames, is approximately  to the east of central London, and  east of the M25 motorway. Its economy is linked to Port of London industries, its own offices, retail and the Lakeside Shopping Centre at West Thurrock. In 1931 the parish had a population of 18,173. History Samuel Pepys recorded in his diary that he visited Grays on 24 September 1665 and apparently bought fish from the local fishermen. Parts of Grays and Chafford Hundred are set within three Victorian chalk pits; the largest two being the Lion Gorge, and the Warren Gorge. Another area of the Chafford Hundred residential development is built on a Victorian landfill site. The civic offices on New Road in Grays were built in the 1980s; work on an extension began in January 2020.

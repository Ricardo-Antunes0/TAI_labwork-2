The koudi (Chinese: 口笛; pinyin: kǒudí; also known as the Indian trombone) is a brass instrument in the brass family. It is similar to the French horn, but larger and with a greater range.   The Chinese koudi is a member of the trumpet family and was originally made in China from brass imported from India. It has been used in Chinese orchestras for centuries and, like the French horn, is now sometimes played in Western classical music.

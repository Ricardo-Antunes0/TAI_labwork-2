Angelo Ribossi (1822-1886) was an Italian painter. He was the leading painter of the neo-classical school in his country. Ribossi was born at Parma in 1822. He studied under Giuseppe Bezzuoli and, in 1848, entered the Academy of Fine Arts of Parma, where he won the first prize for painting in 1851. He traveled to Rome in 1853, and remained there until 1858, when he went to Naples. In 1860 he came back to Parma and established himself as a leading painter. He died in 1886.  Ribossi's paintings depict scenes from classical mythology and history, as well as contemporary subjects. His works are characterized by their cool and formal qualities, as well as their use of light and color. They are often compared to those of Anton Raphael Mengs and Peter Paul Rubens.

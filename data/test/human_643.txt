R Monocerotis, abbreviated R Mon, is a very young binary star system in the equatorial constellation of Monoceros. The apparent magnitude of R Mon varies between 10 and 12 and the spectral type is B8IIIe. However, it is more likely of a late B- or early A-type. This is a massive Herbig Ae/Be star, a type of pre-main-sequence star that is surrounded by an orbiting circumstellar disk of gas and dust. This disk has a mass of  and extends outward to a distance of under  from the host. Because of this dust, the star is obscured from direct visual sight but can still be observed in the infrared. R Mon is still in the accretion phase of star formation and it is driving an optically opaque bipolar outflow with a velocity of 9Â km/s. The northern flow is blue-shifted, and thus moving more toward the Sun. There is a T Tauri-type stellar companion at an angular separation of  from the primary.

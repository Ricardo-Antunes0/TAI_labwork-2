Syntomiprosopus (meaning "short face") is an extinct genus of archosauriform, possibly a crocodylomorph from the Late Triassic period of Arizona. The type and only known species is S. sucherorum. Syntomiprosopus was unusually short-snouted, comparable to the Late Cretaceous notosuchian Simosuchus, and is regarded as an example of convergent evolution between Triassic stem-archosaurs and Cretaceous archosaurs. Discovery and naming  Fossils of Syntomiprosopus were discovered at a locality in the Downs' Quarry located in eastern Arizona, just above the "Placerias Quarry" and just below the principal horizon of the Downs' Quarry. The fossils were recovered during joint excavations by the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences (NCSM) and Appalachian State University (ASU) between 2013 and 2015 as part of a series of excavations that had begun in 2010. The quarry is part of the expansive Late Triassic Chinle Formation, and has been radiometrically dated to have been deposited at a maximum age of approximately 219.39 Â± 0.16 million years old.

The Faust Landmark, formerly known as the Faust Hotel (or Hotel Faust) and Tebala Towers, is located on East State Street, is one of the largest buildings in downtown Rockford, Illinois, United States.  It  currently serves persons 55 years and older.  Built in 1929 as a hotel, it was sold to the Shriners who renamed it Tebala Towers.  It was renamed to its current name when sold by the Shriners and was renovated into one and two bedroom efficiency apartments. Description A Historic Landmark, the Faust is 15 stories tall (186Â ft., 57 m) and is capped by a flagpole over the penthouse with a large U.S. flag that flies 24 hours a day.  The "Faust" is still Rockford's tallest building.  Before 1980 the hotel was also adorned with a set of large red neon letters in a double row that proclaimed Faust Hotel and later, Tebala Towers on the north top side and the east top side of the building.  In the early 1980s a fierce windstorm knocked down some of the letters, damaging the building and putting pedestrians & residents at risk.   All of these letters were taken down shortly after this incident.  Plans to place a large replica of a 'Fez' Cap over the penthouse, at the base of the flagpole, was abandoned as impractical.

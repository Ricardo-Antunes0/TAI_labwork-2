Wyke is a rural and suburban village in Surrey, England.  Its local government district is the Borough of Guildford.  The nearest town is Aldershot,  west although the large village/town of Ash, Surrey is  west and has more shops than smaller Wyke and adjacent Normandy combined.  Normandy, Surrey is also dispersed yet is typically marked just  east, near its manors.  Normandy, Flexford and Christmas Pie share the parish church of Wyke, being relatively central to the four former hamlets.  Wyke shares in the sports associations and community groups of Normandy. History Wyke, unlike the larger settlement of Flexford, appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Wucha held by Godric from (Turald) Thorold under Roger de/of Montgomery. It was part of Burpham manor and was valued underneath its listing. As heads of household it had four villagers, three smallholders, one serf (a form of slavery abolished by the time of the Magna Carta), two ploughlands and woodland for 83 pigs, 25 acres of meadow and a mill worth 15s per year.  It rendered 8 pound sterling per year to its feudal system overlords.

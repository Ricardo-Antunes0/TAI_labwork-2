Education in the Bailiwick of Guernsey is the combined education systems of Guernsey, Alderney and Sark. In Guernsey, it is overseen by the Education Section of the Committee for Education, Sport and Culture, part of the States of Guernsey. The States manage a number of island schools, including three comprehensive secondary schools and one grammar school, as well as the island's higher education facility, the Guernsey Institute. There are also a number of private schools on the island. Students at States-maintained schools must attend primary school from Reception to Year 6 (ages 4 to 11; Early Years Foundation, Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2) and secondary school from Year 7 to 11 (ages 11 to 16; Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4). At the end of Year 11. students typically take General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) exams or other Level 1 or Level 2 qualifications. For students who do not pursue academic qualifications until the end of Year 13, these qualifications are roughly equivalent to the completion of high school in many other countries.

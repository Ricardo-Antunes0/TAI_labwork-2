Emma Rene (Rhodes) Gresham (April 13, 1925 â€“ March 2, 2018) was an American teacher and politician who was mayor of Keysville, Georgia. Gresham was born in Reidsville, Georgia, to Herman and Ida Clark Rhodes. Gresham graduated from Boggs Academy at the age of 15 as the salutatorian of her class, she was also a 1953 honor graduate of Paine College. In 1942, she married Quinten Gresham Sr. Gresham taught mainly elementary-age special education students in Talladega, Alabama, and Augusta, Georgia, for over 32 years.  In 1985, on finding out about the inactive charter and government of her hometown of Keysville, Georgia, which had not been functioning since 1933, she ran for mayor. Gresham ran, only to have the position stripped from her after five hours by a Superior Court judge in Augusta who revoked the city's charter, upholding a challenge by a group of residents who disputed the town's boundaries.

A retail lease is a legal document used to establish a commercial relationship between a retailer and a landlord. The lease outlines the rights and obligations of the tenant and landlord, and may include provisions for rent, security deposits, and termination rights.  Retail leasing is an important part of the retail industry, as it allows retailers to secure long-term space in which to operate while also reducing the risk of investing in new physical stores. A retail lease can be advantageous for both the tenant and the landlord, as it allows the tenant to lock in a specific location and receive benefits such as lower rents, security deposits, and longer terms. Retail leases can also be used by landlords to generate income from leased space while allowing them to avoid the risks associated with operating a business.

The Trinovantes or Trinobantes were one of the three major tribes of the British Isles in the Iron Age.  The Trinovantes were located in southeast England, in the area now known as the Thames Valley. They are thought to have spoken a language closely related to those of the Belgic Gauls.  The Trinovantes were one of the most powerful of the British Iron Age tribes, and occupied an important position in eastern and southern Britain. Their capital was at Camulodunum (now Colchester), and they also had settlements at Maiden Castle, Ospringe, and Beckhampton.  The Trinovantes were conquered by the Romans in 43 AD, and their territory was divided among the four legions that garrisoned Britain at that time. Much of it was eventually lost to subsequent Anglo-Saxon and Norman invasions.

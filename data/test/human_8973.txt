Gordon Neufeld (1946) is a developmental psychologist and author of the book Hold on to Your Kids: Why Parents Need to Matter More Than Peers (co-authored with Canadian physician Gabor Mat√©) that has been translated into 10 languages. The Neufeld approach (his attachment-based developmental model) is based on the attachment theory formulated by John Bowlby. He developed a theory of attachment that includes six stages in the development of the capacity for relationship, the construct of polarization that explains both shyness and defensive detachment. His model of attachment is universal in both its application (adults as well as children) and implementation (school as well as home). Neufeld also is the founder of the Neufeld Institute based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The Institute provides education and training for parents and professionals through personalized study programs as well as through presentations, seminars and courses, including video courses. Neufeld Faculty and education programs exist currently in a number of languages including English, French, German, Spanish, Hebrew, Swedish and Russian.

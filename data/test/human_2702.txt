Samuel Mathew Piantadosi (April 1946 - 4 March 2010) was an Australian union official and politician. A senior Western Australian union official and the founding chairman of the Ethnic Communities Council in the 1980s, he was elected as a Labor Party member of the Western Australian Legislative Council at the 1983 state election. His election made him the first post-war Italian migrant to be elected to the Parliament of Western Australia. He was re-elected in 1989, but resigned from the Labor Party in 1996, late in his second term, after reading newspaper reports that party figures were suggesting he would retire. He subsequently resigned from the Legislative Council several months short of the conclusion of his term in an unsuccessful attempt to contest the Legislative Assembly seat of Yokine as an independent at the 1996 state election. He returned to politics in 2007 as a councillor and later Deputy Mayor of the Town of Bassendean, and held the latter role until his death. Career before politics

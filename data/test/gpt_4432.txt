Neophylarcha helicosema is a moth in the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Meyrick in 1914. It is found in Peru.  The wingspan is 13–14 mm. The forewings are silvery-white, somewhat irrorated with black, the costa narrowly blackish towards the base, a broad black fascia from one-fourth to three-fourths, narrowed to the dorsum before the middle and indented posteriorly beyond the middle, forming a small black spot on the costa before the apex, as well as a small triangular spot on the costa near the base. There is a rather large black blotch extending from beneath two-thirds of the costa to before the dorsum beyond the middle, edged posteriorly with white suffusion and suffused with black around its edge. This blotch is divided into two nearly equal parts by an anteriorly placed slender white line, posteriorly continued as an oblique streak from four-fifths of the costa to near the tornus, where it curves downwards and meets a second line from before one-fourth of the costa. A broad white fascia runs from before two-thirds of this streak to three-fourths of its length and beyond, attenuated anteriorly and continued as an irregular streak to two-thirds of the termen. The hindwings are light grey.

Macabre Eternal is the fifth album by the American death metal band Autopsy, released on May 16, 2011, on the label Peaceville Records. It is the first studio album Autopsy have released after their 1995 disbandment and 2009 reunion. The first album to feature bassist Joe Trevisano. It is also the first album since 1989's Severed Survival not to feature any short tracks. Background After Autopsy disbanded in 1995, its leaders Chris Reifert and Danny Coralles resurfaced for the hardcore punk-influenced death metal supergroup Abscess, also featuring Clint Bower on guitar and vocals and another former Autopsy member Frank "Freeway" Migliore on bass. The group released their debut album, Seminal Vampires and Maggot Men, before Migliore left the band in 1997. Abscess continued on with new bassist Joe Allen and released more well-received albums before splitting up in June 2010. After Coralles said in a May 2004 interview that an Autopsy reunion would never happen, the members of Autopsy reunited in the studio in September 2008 to record two new tracks (that are very similar to the old material of Autopsy) for the special edition of their 1989 classic debut Severed Survival, which was released on February 23, 2009. Following the release of the album's reissue, the reunited Autopsy made their debut performing live for the first time in over a decade at Maryland Deathfest. There, the band unveiled new member Dan Lilker, who took over bass duties.

The Convention of 1833 (April 1â€“13, 1833), also known as the Missouri Compromise, was an agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom that resolved the issue of slavery in the Louisiana Territory. The convention was convened to resolve the difficulties created by the admission of Missouri to the Union as a free state. The convention resulted in the compromise that allowed Missouri to enter the Union as a slave state and Maine to enter as a free state.

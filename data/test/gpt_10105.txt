Go Vegan Radio is a one-hour talk show that airs every Thursday at 10pm EST on the radio station KEXP in Seattle, Washington. The show is hosted by vegan activists and advocates Kelly and Matt Christoff and focuses on vegan news, events, recipes, and lifestyle tips.  Veganism is a plant-based diet that excludes all animal products, including eggs, dairy, and meat. There are many different ways to be vegan, including strict adherence to an all-plant diet or incorporating small amounts of animal-free foods into one's regular diet.  The benefits of a vegan lifestyle are wide-ranging and include environmental sustainability, reduced health risks, and improved animal welfare. Although becoming vegan is not always easy, the rewards are many.

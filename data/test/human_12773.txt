North Hsenwi was a Shan state in the Northern Shan States in what is today Burma. The capital was Lashio town which was also the headquarters of the superintendent of the Northern Shan State. North Hsenwi, with an area of 6330 m², had a population in 1901 of 118,325 persons and an estimated revenue of £6000. History Sivirattha, the predecessor state, was founded before 650 AD according to tradition. This legendary state became Hsenwi State with the passing of the centuries. Hsenwi was by far the largest of the cis-Salween Shan states, and at one time included not only all the territory of the present states of North and South Hsenwi, but also Kehsi Mansam, Mong Hsu, Mong Sang, and Mong Nawng, besides having a sort of protectorate over Mang Lon and other Wa states east of the Salween. These had, however, fallen away in Burmese times, and before the annexation following British rule in Burma, Hsenwi was divided into five parts by name; but there was no central authority, and chaos prevailed all over the state.

Ultra was the designation adopted by British intelligence for a secret project during the Second World War to create an ultra-secret communications system. The project was code-named "Ultra."  The Ultra project was initiated in August 1939, at the onset of the Second World War, by the British General Staff. Its objective was to develop a secure communications system that could be used by the British military to communicate in secret with other allied forces, and with the United Kingdom's own strategic headquarters.  The project was led by Professor John Tiltman at Bletchley Park, and involved the use of various codebreaking techniques, including codebreaking at the very highest level. It eventually produced a system that could be used to communicate between London and Washington, and also between London and Cairo.  The project was eventually declassified in January 1995.

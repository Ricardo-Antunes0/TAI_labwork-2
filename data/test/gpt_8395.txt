The Gulf of Bomba, is a body of water located in the Atlantic Ocean, northeast of the Lesser Antilles. The gulf is bounded by the Turks and Caicos Islands to the north, by the Bahamas to the east, by the US state of Florida to the south, and by Cuba to the west.  The gulf is named after Bomba Island, which was discovered in 1513 and was subsequently colonized by Spain in 1516. The island was part of the Captaincy General of Cuba until its abolition in 1868. The gulf was made a National Monument by presidential proclamation on March 2, 1935.

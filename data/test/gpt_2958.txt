Fallsville Splash Park was a water park in Fallsville, Tennessee. It was known for its large slides, wave pool, and lazy river. The park was closed in 2007 and demolished in 2008.  The Fallsville Splash Park opened in 1987 as a small water park located in the back of a local grocery store. It quickly became a popular summer destination for families in the area. The park expanded over the years, adding new slides, a wave pool, and a lazy river. In 2007, the park was closed after an expansion of the nearby theme park Six Flags Over Tennessee caused traffic congestion. The Splash Park was demolished in 2008 to make way for new development.

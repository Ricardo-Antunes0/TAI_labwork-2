Arthur Wellesley Vowell (September 17, 1841 â€“ December 13, 1915) was an American author, journalist, and poet.  Vowell was born in Danville, Kentucky. After graduating from the University of Louisville, he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he worked as a newspaper reporter and editor. In 1868 he began writing poetry, and his first collection, "Wild Flowers", was published the following year. He moved to New York City in 1873 and became a regular contributor to the magazines "Harper's Weekly" and "The Nation". His poems were also published in numerous anthologies.  In 1884 Vowell began writing books for children. His most popular work was "The Oregon Trail", which was published in twelve editions and became a classic of children's literature. He also wrote novels for adults, including "A Voice from the South" (1902), "Washington: The Making of an American Legend" (1905), and "The Education of Henry Adams" (1907).  Vowell retired from writing in 1911 but continued to lecture on literary topics until his death at age 73 in 1915.

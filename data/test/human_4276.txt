The Electric Confectionaires were a four-piece musical group from Auckland, New Zealand. Their music is a diverse fusion of styles ranging from rock to garage, blues, surf and jazz. The band formed in 2005 at Takapuna Grammar School where original members Jaisi Sheehan, Haddon Smith, Rob Fenton, Calum Gunn and Toby McLeanan shared a music class. The group gained nationwide recognition when they won the 2005 Smokefree Rockquest. Formation and signing Sheehan, Smith and Gunn hail from Devonport and first met in primary school after Gunn emigrated from Scotland. Fenton (originally from Wellington) and Smith, bonded at school over a mutual love of jazz. In their music class at Takapuna Grammar School they formed the Electric Confectionaires with McLeanan. Later that year the group entered and won the Smokefree Rockquest, an annual high school music competition. Similar to other Rockquest participants, such as Bic Runga, Evermore and Nesian Mystik, the band gained nationwide recognition from the win, which led to a record signing. In December 2006 they signed with Sony BMG, and in November 2007 their debut album Sweet Tooth was released, following the singles 'Late Night Shopping Spree' and 'Sweet Tooth'. The album was recorded at Montage Studios in Grey Lynn with Murray Grindley (ex member of The Underdogs) in charge of production and Nic Manders in charge of engineering.

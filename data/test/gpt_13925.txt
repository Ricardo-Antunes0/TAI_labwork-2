Grand Junction is a railway junction in the city of Birmingham, England. The junction is where the Midland Main Line, the Birminghamâ€“Birmingham New Street railway line, and the West Coast Main Line meet. The junction has four tracks and two platforms.  The first railway to reach Birmingham was the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway, which opened in 1838. The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) reached Birmingham in 1846, and the Midland Railway (MR) followed in 1849. The MR built a junction at Grand Junction to connect its lines to those of the LNWR and the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The LNER built a second junction nearby in 1922.  The junction was bombed during World War II, and most of the original buildings were destroyed. The current buildings were completed in 1961. Traffic at Grand Junction has increased rapidly since the 1990s as a result of the development of the northern suburbs of Birmingham.

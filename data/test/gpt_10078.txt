Formed in 2006, Switched was a five-piece alternative rock band from Brisbane, Australia. Active from 2006 to 2013, the band released two studio albums, "Switched" (2006) and "The Hurting Game" (2009), before splitting up.  The group's music was characterised by dark lyrics, heavy guitars and an experimental edge. Influenced by such acts as Radiohead, Muse and The Pixies, Switched tended to eschew mainstream success in favour of creating their own sound.  After releasing two successful albums, the band announced their breakup in early 2013. Since then, Switched has largely been forgotten by the public eye; however, their music continues to be enjoyed by a niche fanbase.

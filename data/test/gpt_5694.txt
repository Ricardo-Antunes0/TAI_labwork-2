Hans Baur (19 June 1897–17 February 1993) was a Swiss psychiatrist who developed the Baur–Meinhof theory of schizophrenia.  Born in Basel, Switzerland, Hans Baur studied medicine at the University of Basel and at the University of Zurich. He served in World War I as a medical officer and then completed his psychiatric training at the Burghölzli Psychiatric Hospital in Zurich.  Baur's early work focused on the treatment of schizophrenia and he was one of the first psychiatrists to use insulin therapy for this condition. He also developed the concept of ego-breaking therapy, which aimed to break the self-destructive patterns that often lead to schizophrenia.  Baur retired from clinical psychiatry in 1966 but continued to work on research projects into the causes and treatment of schizophrenia until his death in 1993. He was awarded the Legion d'Honneur by France in 1977.

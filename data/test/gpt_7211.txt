WGMM is an AM radio station licensed to serve the greater Mobile, Alabama, area. The station broadcasts a News/Talk format.  WGMM first went on the air on October 2, 1922 as WENL. It was owned by the Wenonah Garden Club and broadcast on 1250 kHz with 1,000 watts of power. In 1934, Wenonah sold WENL to the Mobile Press Register, which changed the station's call letters to WMGG.  WMGG went through a series of owners during the next two decades, including Roy S. Roberts, who purchased the station in 1951 and changed its call letters to WGMM-FM in 1954. Roberts introduced a MOR format to WGMM-FM in 1957 and it remained that way until 1978, when it began airing a country music format.  In 1983, WGMM-FM became an affiliate of ABC Radio and remained so until 1994. That year, the station changed formats again and became known as "The Grand Old Lady of Mobile Radio." It aired a classic hits format featuring artists such as Patsy Cline, Tammy Wynette, and Johnny Cash.  In 1996, WGMM-FM became an affiliate of Fox News Radio and aired a conservative talk format branded as "The Fox News Channel." The station later switched to Fox Business Radio before adopting its current News/Talk format in 2002.

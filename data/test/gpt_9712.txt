Larrabee is the codename for a cancelled microarchitecture project by AMD that was meant to compete with Intel's Pentium 4.  Larrabee was announced in 2002 and was intended to be a successor to AMD's K7 microarchitecture. Larrabee aimed to improve performance by using a new, more efficient instruction set and a new micro-architectural design.  However, development on Larrabee was cancelled in 2003 and the project was subsequently abandoned.

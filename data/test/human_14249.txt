Chicks Incorporated were an Australian dance rock band formed in Brisbane, Queensland in 1977. Their sound was largely derived from American soul, funk, pop, rock and disco.  Starting out as an almost all-female band with guitarist Chris Mitchell being the only male member, they were led by the late drummer Miriam Curtis, who produced their sole album "Security" in 1980.  They attracted a lot of local attention due to their sexy appearance and wild dancing. The band's first single was "Jive To Stay Alive" released on RCA Records, and was also featured on a few disco compilation albums such as "Dats Disco" on RCA.  Most of the band's material was written by well-respected Brisbane songwriters Laurie Stone and Peter Moscos, as well as keyboard player David Bentley, formerly of Python Lee Jackson and best known for the hit "In A Broken Dream" which was sung by Rod Stewart.

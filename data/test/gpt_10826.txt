Oscar Charlie is a 13-episode CBBC children's television series, created by David Walliams, that aired from 16 October 2007 to 9 January 2008.  The show is set in the fictional town of Swindon, and follows the lives of its inhabitants. The show's main characters are Oscar (Oscar Charlie), a 7-year-old schoolboy who is often mistaken for being much older due to his sophisticated manner of speaking and his advanced knowledge of world affairs; his best friend and neighbour, Maurice (a combined creation of Walliams and scriptwriter Steve Pemberton); and Oscar's mother, Peggy (played by Rachael Stirling).   The show was generally well-received by critics, with particular praise for its humour and writing. However, it was cancelled after just 13 episodes had aired, due to low ratings.

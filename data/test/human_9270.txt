Leucospermum utriculosum is a lax, evergreen, upright and arching shrub of 1–2 m (3–6½ ft) high, from the family Proteaceae. It has hairless inverted lance-shaped to oblong leaves tipped with three to five teeth and globe-shaped to flattened light yellow to coppery flowerheads of 5–8 cm (2.0–3.2 in) in diameter. From the center of the flowers emerge almost straight styles that jointly give the impression of a pincushion. It is called Breede River pincushion in English. Although flower heads may occur on and off between May and March, the peak season is from September to November. It is known from the Western Cape province of South Africa. Description  Leucospermum utriculosum is an upright or spreading shrub of 1–2 m (3–6½ ft) high and 2–3 m (6½–10 ft) across, with an informal habit. Its branches grow out at an angle up to the horizontal and often droop to the ground. It grows from a stout single main stem that branches low down, and is covered in a smooth, grey bark. The flowering stems are about 3½ mm (0.14 in) thick, and covered in fine crisped hairs and long, straight, silky hairs. The hairless leaves are inverted lance-shaped with a wedge-shaped base narrowing to a stalk, the tip cut-off, with three to five stout teeth of 4½–7 cm (1.8–2.8 in) long and 1–2 cm (0.4–0.8 in) wide.

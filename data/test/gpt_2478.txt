Scenario paintball is a colloquialism used to describe full-scale paintball games staged in an outdoor setting that typically features a scenario layout or storyline. Participants typically assume the roles of combatants in a battle between opposing armies, and are directed by a referee to advance through the scenario, often completing objectives in sequence.  The popularity of scenario paintball has led to the development of dedicated scenarios and game scenarios, as well as commercial paintball fields that offer a variety of themed games. In some cases, these games are based on movies, television shows, video games, or other popular fictional universes.

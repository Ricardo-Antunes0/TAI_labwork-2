David George "Duke" Zeibert (1910 â€“ August 15, 1997) was, for 44 years, the proprietor of a restaurant in Washington, D.C. that was frequented by Presidents, senators, lawyers, lobbyists, quarterbacks, coaches, and columnists. Every President from Harry S. Truman to Gerald Ford ate at his restaurant, Jimmy Carter sent his son Jeff with an autographed picture to the location. Zeibert was born in 1910 in Troy, New York, and as a young man drifted into the restaurant business, working his way up from busing to waiter and eventually landing in Washington on K Street for many years and later at Connecticut Avenue and L Street, a prime downtown location in Washington, just four blocks from the White House. He was given the nickname Duke because he was always a fancy dresser.  People started calling him Duke in Miami in the 1940s, when he showed up for work as a waiter in white silk pants. He looked like Paul Whiteman, the band leader.

Fuhlsbüttel Nord (Fuhlsbüttel North) is a station on the Hamburg U-Bahn line U1. It was opened in July 1921 and is located in Hamburg, Germany, on the boundaries of the quarters of Fuhlsbüttel and Langenhorn. Both are part of the borough of Hamburg-Nord. History  The station was opened in July 1921, after the Langenhorn railway was in preliminary operation with steam trains since 5 January 1918. But in 1918 there was no need for a station in Fuhlsbüttel-Nord, as the vicinity was mainly farmland, and there were only a few buildings at the street of Langenhorner Chaussee. So the station was opened in July 1921, then as Langenhorn Süd (Langenhorn South). In the following years the station was partly used to connect the airport of Hamburg, though being a few miles away from the terminals. Therefore, on 2 October 1934 the station was renamed into Flughafen (Airport). But the airport was better connected with tram line 28, later 9, so on 1 January 1954 the station was renamed again after the street in front of the station into Flughafenstraße. On 5 August 1984 it was renamed again into Fuhlsbüttel Nord to avoid confusion, because a new shuttle service (bus line 110, Airport Express) was established from Ohlsdorf station to the airport.

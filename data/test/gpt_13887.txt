Deck v. Missouri, 544 U.S. 622 (2005), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court unanimously ruled that a state law banning "the use of a playing card, dice, or any other device or article for gaming" was unconstitutional.  The case involved an ordinance in the city of St. Louis, Missouri, that made it a misdemeanor to possess a deck of playing cards or any other device or article for gaming. The ordinance was challenged on the grounds that it violated the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.  The Missouri law was passed in response to a series of high-profile cases in which defendants were convicted of using playing cards to gamble. The defendants in these cases argued that the playing card ban was unconstitutional because it violated their right to free speech.  The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in Deck v. Missouri that the Missouri law was unconstitutional because it violated the free speech rights of defendants who were convicted under it. The Court wrote that "the use of a playing card, dice, or any other device or article for gaming is an essential part of many traditional games enjoyed throughout the United States." The Court went on to say that "the First Amendment protects against compelled participation in such games."

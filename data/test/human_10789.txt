Three days before he died, he wrote a final poem:   무지개    김영무    이 땅에 시인 하나 풀꽃으로 피어나 바람결에 놀다 갔다.   풀무치 새 울음소리 좋아하고 이웃 피붙이 같은 버들치 힘찬 지느러미 짓 더욱 좋아했다.   찬 이슬 색동보석 맺치는 풀섶세상—참 다정도 하다.   2001.11.23평촌 Rainbow Kim Young-Moo   In this land one poet blossomed—a wild flower,  played in the wind, then went away.   He enjoyed the songs of crickets and birds, enjoyed even more the sturdy fin-strokes of minnows, neighborly, kin-like.   The world of wild greenery where cool drops of dew hang, many-hued jewels—it's so full of tenderness.

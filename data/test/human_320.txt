Paul Block (November 2, 1875 – June 22, 1941) was president of Paul Block and Associates (later Block Communications) and publisher of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and Toledo Blade. Biography Block was born on November 2, 1875 to a poor Lithuanian Jewish family in Königsberg, East Prussia. In 1885, his parents immigrated to Elmira, New York, where his father worked as a ragpicker. Block attended Elmira public schools and at the age of 10, he worked as a part-time newsboy and office messenger with Harry Brooks, the founder of the Elmira Telegram, where he learned the newspaper business. In 1900, he left the Elmira Telegram and formed his own advertising rep firm which sold national advertising for client newspapers, Block Communications, and is credited with pioneering the concept of national news advertising. He developed a close friendship and business relationship with William Randolph Hearst frequently serving as a frontman for Hearst's newspaper acquisitions (Block's mistress Marion Davies would become Hearst's mistress and Block would later serve as Hearst's executor) as well as purchasing several papers outright beginning with the Newark Star-Eagle and the Detroit Journal. In 1926, he acquired the Toledo Blade and in 1927, he created the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. He went on to own 14 papers.

Ourehouare (died 1698) was a native American leader of the Cayuga people. Ourehouare had helped prevent the purchase of Susquehanna lands by William Penn.  The Cayugas had moved from what is now the Finger Lake region of Northern New York State to the present Prince Edward County area in Ontario prior to 1673.  In 1687 the French Governor was de Denonville. France had control of the western fur trade but the Iroquois confederacy, which included the Cayugas, contested the western fur trade with the help of the English. De Champigny captured  a group of Cayugas and lured another group into the fort, where they were all imprisoned.  Per√© captured Ourehouare and several others and these prisoners were added to the rest. The 51 Cayugas were stripped, tied to stakes, tortured and shipped to France. This caused an outbreak of warfare in that area of New France for over 10 years.  As a result, King Louis XIV returned the captives in 1689, and replaced de Denonville with Louis de Buade de Frontenac.

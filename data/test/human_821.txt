Halostagnicola larsenii is a non-motile, aerobic, gram-negative, rod shaped archaeon. It is a halophilic, neutrophilic, chemo-organotroph and was isolated from samples taken from a saline lake in China. The etymology of the name comes from hals, halos Greek for salt, stagnum Latin for a piece of standing water, -cola Latin for inhabitant or dweller, and Larsenii named after the Norwegian microbiologist, Helge Larsen, who was a pioneer in research regarding halophiles. Discovery In September 2003, researchers from the University of Seville, Spain, obtained samples of sediment from a lake in Inner Mongolia, China. Lake Xilinholt is an extremely saline lake, thus providing the optimum growth conditions for Halostagnicola larsenii . The samples were cultivated in a 20% saline solution. Nutrient agar plates were used to cultivate the samples. The media contained sodium chloride and was optimized at a pH of 7.5. H. larsenii grows optimally at 15% NaCl, 37 ° Celsius and pH 7-8. It is unable to grow at temperatures above 50 ° Celsius. Further characterization of the species was conducted and it was proposed by Castillo et al., that strain XH-48 be identified as a new species within the Halostagnicola phylum.

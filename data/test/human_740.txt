Impala Saracens is a Kenyan rugby club based at the Impala Club (a sporting/country club in Nairobi, Kenya). The club competes in the Kenya Cup as well as the Enterprise Cup. The club is based and trains at their ground on Ngong Road, adjacent to the RFUEA Ground, and also has an association football division. History The origin of the present Rugby Section of the Impala Club dates back to 1930 when an old boy of the Prince of Wales School (now Nairobi School), Gregory Comninos, started raising teams of old boys to play regular mid-week matches against the School.  These matches proved to be a very popular and the possibility of starting an official club was put forward.  A meeting was held at the Prince of Wales School and the Old Cambrians Club was launched.  It was decided at this time that the club would wear the Welsh colours as their kit.  The club initially prospered however, shortly after the acquisition of their Ngong Road ground in 1949, the club went through extremely tough times, the low-point being the 1953 season when no rugby was played. A decision was made to re-launch the club under the name Impala RFC, with many of the old players and coaching staff staying on.  This led to a return in strength of the club, and in 1959 they enjoyed an unbeaten season (though ironically this powerful team were not allowed to enter the Enterprise Cup competition due to vageries in the then qualification process which required them to have finished in the top three of the previous year's Nairobi District Championship).  Impala continued to prosper into the Sixties, winning the Enterprise Cup in 1961 & 1965.

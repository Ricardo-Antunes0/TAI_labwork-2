Benedetto Bonfigli (c. 1420 – July 8, 1496) was an Italian painter of the Late Gothic period, active mainly in Siena.  Bonfigli was born in Siena, the son of a shoemaker. He learned his art from the painters of the Sienese School, such as Fra Angelico and Lorenzetti, before moving to Florence in the 1440s. In 1450 he moved back to Siena, where he was highly respected and worked on frescoes for the Duomo. He also painted a "Last Supper" for the refectory of San Francesco.  Bonfigli's style is highly influenced by Giotto, with whom he is sometimes grouped together as one of the Four Great Masters of Early Renaissance painting. However, he developed his own unique style, characterized by naturalistic backgrounds and realistic figures. His work is often compared with that of Paolo Uccello, who also worked in Siena at around the same time.  Bonfigli died in 1496 and is buried in Siena Cathedral.

Saguna Brahman (lit. "The Absolute with qualities") is a term that has been used in Hinduism to describe the Absolute, considered to be the highest form of existence. It is also used as an epithet for God.  The concept of Saguna Brahman is found in the Vedas, and it is one of the key tenets of Hindu philosophy. It is often described as the "Absolute Reality", "Supreme Being", or "Universal Spirit". Saguna Brahman is said to be eternal, infinite, and omnipresent. It is also said to be the cause of everything that exists, and it is believed to be responsible for creating, maintaining, and destroying worlds.  The concept of Saguna Brahman has been criticized by some Hindu philosophers as being too abstract and difficult to understand. However, it remains a central part of Hindu theology and belief.

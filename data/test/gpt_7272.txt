A nanoradio (also called carbon nanotube radio) is an electronic device that uses carbon nanotubes as the radio frequency transmission medium. Nanoradios are potential replacements for conventional radio frequency (RF) devices, such as radios, cell phones, and satellite receivers, due to their size, low power consumption, and long range capability.  Nanoradios can have a range of tens of meters to kilometers depending on the transmitter power and the environment in which the nanoradio is used. They are also resistant to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and can operate in the microwave range.

Operation Candid: Protection of the Royal Family in an Emergency was a Cold War contingency plan of the British Government to evacuate Queen Elizabeth II, the Duke of Edinburgh and other members of the British royal family from London in the event of nuclear war. The plan was devised in late 1962 following the Cuban Missile Crisis and approved the following year. History During a time of crisis a Royal Duties Force would be formed. The force would be around 1,300 officers and men consisting of a reinforced battalion from one of the five regiments of Foot Guards, a reinforced squadron of the Household Cavalry equipped with armoured cars, a medical detachment, communications vehicles and other support and transport vehicles. It would be fully mobile and self-supporting for seven days. The force was capable of being split into four separate, self-supporting units to disperse key members of the royal family to different locations.

A heliodon (HEE-leo-don) is a device for measuring the horizontal and vertical angles of a celestial object, typically a star. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words Ἑλιος (helios) meaning "sun" and δών (dón) meaning "measure".  The heliodon was invented by Hipparchus in the 2nd century BC. It consisted of a disk with a graduated scale on one side, mounted on a pivot so that it could be rotated about its centre to measure angles. The instrument could also be used to estimate distances to celestial objects.

Ohanzee "Hanzee" Dent is a fictional character in the FX television series Fargo, appearing in the second season, played by Zahn McClarnon. Initially a tracker and enforcer for the Gerhardt crime family, Hanzee serves as eldest son Dodd’s right hand man for much of the season. However, he eventually turns on the Gerhardts, personally killing Dodd and setting up the rest of the family to be killed in a shootout with the police. In the season finale, it’s revealed that Hanzee gets extensive plastic surgery and a new identity, becoming Moses Tripoli, who appeared as a minor character in the first season, played by Mark Acheson. Character overview Hanzee is a mysterious Native American tracker and hitman working for the Gerhardt family having been adopted by Otto Gerhardt at a young age. It is noted by the narrator (Martin Freeman) in "The Castle" that "Not much is known about Ohanzee Dent. We have no birth certificate, no tribal or family history." Similar to Coen (or Coen-esque) villains like Anton Chigurh and Lorne Malvo, he fits the "unstoppable killer" archetype, having been responsible for several deaths during the war against Kansas City and the search for the Blumquists. However, despite seemingly being cold and remorseless, he is shown to be a complex person with a complicated, tragic backstory, suffering from the racism and ill-treatment of various countrymen. When he stops by a bar en route to Sioux Falls, he happens upon a plaque outside the bar boasting about deaths of 22 Sioux Indians who were hanged there, with a puddle of vomit below. He endures bigotry from the bartender despite informing him of his service in Vietnam which prompts him to kill the bartender, a few racist bar patrons and two state police officers, although one officer survived and was left in critical condition, mentioned by Lou in a previous episode. On his character's sudden betrayal of his employers, McClarnon stated "Hanzee had an agenda from the beginning. There are multiple moments that happen throughout the show that suggests he wanted to become more of an individual."

13 Ceti is a triple star system in the constellation Cetus. It is about twice as distant from Earth as the Sun, and is thus a faint object by human standards. The system has two stars, both of which are about the size of the Sun and are in orbit around each other. 13 Ceti is notable for being the first planetary system to be discovered by direct imaging, when a team of astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope detected evidence that a planet existed around one of the stars.

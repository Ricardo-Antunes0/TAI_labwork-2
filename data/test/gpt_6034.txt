DAISY is a band based in Los Angeles, California. The band consists of vocalist and songwriter Glenn Mercer, guitarist and vocalist Richie Kotzen, bassist Scott Rockenfield, and drummer Derron NGUYEN.  Formed in 1995, DAISY released their self-titled debut album in 1997 on Epic Records. The album peaked at number 48 on the "Billboard" 200 and produced the singles "The Hardest Thing" and "Invisible". The band toured heavily in support of the album, headlining dates at venues such as Madison Square Garden and The Forum in Los Angeles.   After releasing two more albums — "Behind the Sun" (1999) and "Welcome to the Machine" (2001) — DAISY went on hiatus in 2002. Kotzen and Rockenfield formed the supergroup 3 Doors Down while Mercer pursued a solo career. In 2013, DAISY reunited with original members Mercer and Kotzen to begin work on a new album. The album, titled "Gravity", was released in February 2016.

Elatinaceae is a family of flowering plants in the order Lamiales. The family is monophyletic and includes about 120 species of shrubs and trees, distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics.  The family is characterised by the presence of elatinins, a type of phytoalexin. The flowers are pollinated by bees, and the family is sometimes known as the bee orchid family. The fruits are eaten by birds, and some species are used as timber trees.

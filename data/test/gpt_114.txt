The Goodyear Inflatoplane was an inflatable experimental aircraft designed and built by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in the early 1930s. After being developed for a number of years, the Inflatoplane made its first flight in May 1933.  The Goodyear Inflatoplane was a radical departure from traditional aircraft design principles. The aircraft was built around an inflatable airframe that could be inflated using onboard machinery, allowing it to take on a variety of shapes and sizes. This flexibility allowed the Inflatoplane to be used for a variety of purposes, including research and development, aviation testing, and personal transportation.  The Inflatoplane played an important role in the development of modern aviation. The aircraft was instrumental in the development of inflatable structures and airships, which would later be used in aircraft such as the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380. The Goodyear Inflatoplane remains one of the most innovative aircraft designs ever created, and has been credited with ushering in the modern era of aviation.

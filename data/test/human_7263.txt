Arthur Rotherham (27 May 1869 â€“ 3 March 1946) was an English rugby union scrum-half who was a member of the first official British Isles tour and was later capped for the England team. Personal history Rotherham was born in Coventry in 1869 to Alexander Rotherham of Coundon Hall. He was educated at Uppingham School before being accepted into Trinity College, Cambridge in 1888, gaining a BA in 1891. Rotherham began his medical career at St Thomas' Hospital, London before becoming a house surgeon at Nottingham General Hospital. He later became an Assistant Medical Officer at several asylums; London County Asylum in Purley, Horton Asylum and Manor Asylum in Epsom, before becoming a superintendent at the Dareth mental home in 1911. Arthur was also the cousin of Alan Rotherham, who was the son of Arthur's father's older brother John. In the late nineteenth century and into the twentieth century, players were listed by their initial and surname and the two cousins were often confused with each other. Compounding the confusion is the fact that they had similar backgrounds and playing careers and as Alan's ended so Arthur's began. Both were born in Coventry, both went to Uppingham School, both played for Richmond F.C., both played at half-back and both played for England and went on to captain the national side.

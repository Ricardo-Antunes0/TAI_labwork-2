Lithocarpus is a genus in the beech family (Fagaceae). The genus is distributed in the temperate and subtropical regions of the world, with a few species in North America. The beech family is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere and contains about 25 genera and 1,000 species. There are about 280 known species of lithocarpus.  The leaves are compound, with a base of three heart-shaped leaflets, and a blade that is either smooth or has small serrations. The tips of the leaflets may be either pointed or blunt, and they are usually slightly concave. The flowers are small and white, and they are grouped in clusters on the ends of branches. The fruit is a cup-shaped nut that contains a single seed.   Lithocarpus is generally hardy, but some species are sensitive to cold weather. It can be used as a fence or tree ornament, or it can be used to produce wood pulp.

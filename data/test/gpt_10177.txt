Donald Lewis Campbell (August 5, 1904 â€“ February 5, 1976) was an American psychologist who made significant contributions to the fields of cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, and educational psychology.  Campbell was born in 1904 in Hillsboro, Ohio. He received his undergraduate degree from Oberlin College in 1922 and his doctorate from the University of Michigan in 1927. He began his teaching career at the University of Missouri in 1928 and later moved to the University of California, Berkeley, where he remained for the rest of his career.  Campbell's research focused on the development of cognitive skills and abilities, particularly memory and thinking process. He is best known for his work on cognitive development, which has helped to shape the field of educational psychology. His early work on cognitive development is often cited as an important precursor to constructivist theory.  Campbell was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1961 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1966. He died in 1976.

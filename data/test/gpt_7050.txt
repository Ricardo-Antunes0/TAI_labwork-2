Pope Paul VI (; ; born Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini; 17 May 1881 â€“ 3 May 1978) was the 266th Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, serving from 1963 to 1978. He is one of only two pontiffs to have served during the Cold War, the other being John Paul II.  Pope Paul VI was known for his liberal views on social issues, and his efforts to modernize the Catholic Church. He convened the Second Vatican Council, which examined many of the same topics as the First Vatican Council, but also made changes such as permitting women to become priests. Pope Paul VI also played a significant role in endowing several Catholic universities and institutes with papal patronage.  Pope Paul VI was consecrated on 17 May 1963, after a long and stormy conclave that ended with two-thirds of the votes going to him. He took the name "Paul VI", after Saint Paul of Thebes, one of the most famous early Christian saints.

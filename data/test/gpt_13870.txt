Mount Pihanga is a  volcanic peak located in the Southern Alps of New Zealand, near the town of Cromwell. With an elevation of 2,816 metres (9,794 ft), it is the seventh-highest mountain in the South Island and one of the most prominent peaks in the area. The peak is part of a larger volcanic complex that includes five other peaks over 2,800 metres: Mount Cook, Mount Aspiring, Mount Tasman, Mount Cook East and Mount Fox.   The mountain was first climbed by members of the Canterbury Mountaineering Club in September 1863. The peak was first named Pihanga by a member of the Canterbury Association who had seen a pihanga bird near the summit. The club's first recorded ascent was made by G. H. Bond and J. S. Herries on 24 September 1863. Pihanga is MƒÅori for "the peak that looks across", or "the peak that sees".

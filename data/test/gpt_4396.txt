Geothermal power is electrical power generated from the Earth's heat. Geothermal energy is harnessed using the Earth's natural heat flow. The main sources of geothermal energy are the Earth's crust and upper mantle. Heat from the Earth's core is also a potential source of geothermal power.  Geothermal power has many potential advantages over other forms of electricity generation. It is renewable, emissions-free, and has low fuel costs. Geothermal power is also considered a reliable source of electricity because it is not subject to weather fluctuations. However, geothermal power has received less attention than other renewable energy sources because of its high initial cost.

Treet (Armour Star Treet) is a canned meat product similar to Spam first introduced in 1939 by Armour and Company in the United States.  Sold as  "spiced luncheon loaf", it is made with chicken and pork and has a more finely ground texture than Spam, more akin to bologna or vienna sausages.  Like Spam, it is often fried or baked before consumption. Treet is currently manufactured by Pinnacle Foods.

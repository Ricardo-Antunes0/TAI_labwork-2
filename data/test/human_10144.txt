Appleton was a Canadian musical duo composed of sisters Natalie and Nicole Appleton. The sisters are better known as members of the girl group All Saints. Biography Natalie and Nicole Appleton were born in 1973 and 1974 respectively to their British mother Mary and their Canadian father, Ken. They also have two elder sisters, Lori and Lee. Their parents divorced in the late 1970s, and the sisters switched frequently between their mother's native United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States.  Both attended Ellenville High School in upstate New York. They stayed in Britain eventually, and became students at the Sylvia Young Theatre School in North London, which was to tutor their fellow All Saints colleague and Nic's schoolmate, Melanie Blatt as well as Denise van Outen, Emma Bunton, Letitia Dean and Samantha Janus. The sisters were back in the UK in 1994, and, together with Shaznay Lewis, joined with former schoolmate Melanie Blatt to form All Saints.

The discography of English pop singer Dusty Springfield includes twenty one studio albums, one live album, thirty compilations, four extended plays and sixty-nine singles. Some of Springfield's albums and singles were unreleased, most notably 1974's Longing. Additionally, many of her early US album releases were released by the US arm of Philips Records, using material recorded in England and America with US and UK single releases included and re-ordered. Thus, these album releases were often collections of her recordings that were not intended by Springfield to have been released as proper albums at all. From 1969 on through 2015, her albums were released simultaneously in the US and the UK, though occasionally with different names and artwork, but the same track listings. Only 1968's Dusty... Definitely and 1972's See All Her Faces (both released only in the UK) and 1982's White Heat (released only the US) deviated from that format. Studio albums

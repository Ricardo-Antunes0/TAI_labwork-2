A drop goal, field goal, dropped goal, drop point, or simply drop, is a goal in association football that is scored by dropping the ball from a height into the opponent's goal area.  The drop goal was first used at the 1887 FA Cup Final between Wanderers and Royal Engineers. The Royal Engineers won 2–1. The first recorded drop goal was scored by Billy Meredith of Aston Villa in a 3–1 victory over Sheffield United on 15 October 1892.

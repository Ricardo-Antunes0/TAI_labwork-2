The Wanted is the first extended play by British-Irish boy band The Wanted. It was released on 24 April 2012 as the band's debut release in Canada and United States via Mercury Records. The album comprises material from The Wanted's two studio albums: The Wanted (2010) and Battleground (2011), as well as two new songs: "Chasing the Sun" and "Satellite". Background During recording sessions for The Wanted's second British studio album, Battleground, it was announced that a record deal with American label Def Jam Recordings was in the pipeline. It was reported that the three-album deal would see the group release material in the United States as early as February 2012. It was later confirmed by Def Jam that the band's first stateside release would be a ten-track EP, that would consist of a mixture of previously available material, alongside two all-new tracks, exclusive to the American market. Soon after the report, the band teased that they had been in the studio with a "big American star", recording a duet entitled "Jealousy". The "star" was later revealed to be Rihanna. It was later reported by Digital Spy that after the song had been mixed, tuned and finalised, the final mix "didn't cut it", and as such, the song had been completely scrapped, and was not going to be released.

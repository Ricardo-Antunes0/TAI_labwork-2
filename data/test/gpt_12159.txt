Aylesford-Swarling pottery is part of a tradition of hand-building pottery that has been practised in Britain for over 2,000 years. The earliest examples of the Aylesford-Swarling pottery style date back to the early Bronze Age and were made from a variety of materials, including clay, sand, and straw.   The Aylesford-Swarling pottery tradition continued into the Iron Age and the Roman period, but began to decline in popularity during the Middle Ages. However, the tradition was revived in the 19th century by a group of potters who were inspired by traditional techniques and designs. Today, Aylesford-Swarling pottery is still hand-made and is popular for its decorative designs and rustic appearance.

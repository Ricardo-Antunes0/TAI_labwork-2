The Rapa fruit dove (Ptilinopus huttoni) is a species of bird in the family Columbidae, which includes pigeons and doves. It is endemic to the island of Rapa Iti in French Polynesia. The species was classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List in 2018 because of its small population and predicted continued decline. The Rapa fruit dove primarily feeds on fleshy fruit. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and it has an extent of 30 km2. It is threatened by habitat loss due to deforestation and invasive species. Effective land protection and management could increase the quality of habitat for the species. Additional research into population dynamics and the impact of threats to the species can give a better understanding of the conservation practices needed. Description and range 	The Rapa fruit dove is approximately 31 centimeters tall, making it a medium-sized dove. It is a colorful bird, with mostly green plumage, especially on its wings. Its foreparts (head, neck, chest, upper back) have blue-gray plumage. It has a yellow lower belly with a rose-purple band below its chest feathers. A distinguishing feature of the Rapa fruit dove is its bright pink crown, located on the face between the eyes.

His work at Yosemite National Park and the development of the Mission 66 program are among his better known projects, although his influence can be seen in parks across America.  Vint's true talents lay in his design elements.  These can best be described as rustic, relating to how he was able to harmonize structures with their natural surroundings. Vint was awarded the Distinguished Service Award, the highest honor conferred for meritorious service to the U.S. government. He was made a Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects and American Institute of Architects. Early life Born in Salt Lake City, Utah to Scots-Irish parents, Vint's family moved shortly after his birth to Los Angeles where he spent his grade school years.  Vint attended Polytechnic High School and upon graduation enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley into the field of landscape architecture.  During his college years Vint worked for design and building firms throughout Los Angeles.  He also found employment for an entire year alongside the successful landscape architect Lloyd Wright, the son of the famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright.

The Mason County War, sometimes called the Mason County Riots, was a series of three armed conflicts fought in Mason County, Kentucky, between white and black farmers from 1914 to 1921.  The first war, fought from 1914 to 1916, was a result of racial tensions arising from the Agricultural Depression of the 1910s. White landowners in the county exploited black tenant farmers by refusing to pay them their fair share of crops and livestock, leading to many disputes and clashes. The second war, fought from 1921 to 1922, was sparked by a race riot in the town of Masonboro that left several dozen people injured and six dead. The third and final war, fought from 1930 to 1931, was provoked by Ku Klux Klan violence against African-American residents in the county.  The Mason County War is considered one of the most violent episodes of racial violence in American history. More than 2,000 people were injured or killed during the three wars, making it one of the deadliest rural civil wars in American history.

Language pedagogy is the discipline concerned with the theories and techniques of teaching language. It contains three stages. In the late 1800s and most of the 1900s, it was usually conceived in terms of method. In 1963, University of Michigan Linguistics Professor Edward Mason Anthony Jr. formulated a framework to describe them into three levels: approach, method and technique. It has been expanded by Richards and Rogers in 1982 to approach, design, and procedure.   There are many methods of teaching language, but all may be characterized by the following three principal views:   The structural view treats language as a system of structurally related elements to code meaning (e.g. grammar).  The functional view sees language as a vehicle to express or accomplish certain functions, (e.g. making a request, giving information or asking for information).  The interactive view sees language as a vehicle for the creation and maintenance of social relations, focusing on patterns of moves, acts, negotiation and interaction found in conversational exchanges. This view has been fairly dominant since the 1980s. Each view encompasses a number of methods which can be utilised in order to teach and learn languages.

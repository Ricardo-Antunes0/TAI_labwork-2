(, The Work of the People) was a French Marxist political party founded in 1871. Led by Jules Guesde and Émile Vandervelde, it played a leading role in the French labor movement.  L'Action du Peuple was founded on October 15, 1871, in the wake of the Franco-Prussian War. Jules Guesde and Émile Vandervelde were its two founders. The party aimed to unite all French workers under one banner, and promote socialism. It played a leading role in the French labor movement, and was one of the most influential Marxist parties of its time. The party was banned during the 1930s, but was later allowed to re-emerge. It played a minor role in the French political landscape during the 1970s and 1980s, but has since experienced a resurgence in popularity. Today, L'Action du Peuple is one of the three major French Marxist parties, along with the Socialist Party and the Communist Party.

The Kanakachalapathi temple is a 16th-century Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu. It is located in the town of Kanakagiri, in the Gangavathi taluk of Koppal district in the Karnataka state, India. Kanakagiri, known in ancient times as "Swarnagiri" (lit, "Hill of Gold") is about 3 km from the district headquarters Koppal city, 380 km north of Bangalore city and 200 km east of Belagavi city. Kanakagiri is known to get its present name from Kanaka Muni, a Hindu saint who performed penance there. The historically important Koppal city, known in ancient inscriptions as Kopana is also of archeological significance due to the discovery of two inscriptions from the rule of Emperor Ashoka (3rd ceneutry B.C.E.) at the nearby villages Palkigundu and Gavimatha. After the end of the Maurya Empire rule over the region when Koppal had been a southern viceroyalty, Koppal passed into the hands of notable dynasties of the Deccan: the Satavahana dynasty, the Western Ganga Dynasty, the Hoysalas and the Chalukya dynasty. The earliest available Kannada classic, the Kavirajamarga of King Nrupatunga Amoghavarsha I (r.814-878 A.D.), mentions Koppal in the sentence Viditha Maha Kopana Nagara.

Professor John Alan Chalmers (29 September 1904 â€“ 14 September 1987) was a Scottish philosopher who is best known for his work on the philosophy of religion.  Born in Edinburgh, Chalmers attended the Royal High School from 1921 to 1924, and then studied mathematics and philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with an MA in 1926. After a period of post-graduate study, he was appointed assistant lecturer at the University of Edinburgh in 1929, and became a full lecturer in 1937. He served as head of the philosophy department from 1954 to 1961, and was knighted in 1961. Chalmers retired from his professorship in 1971, but continued to write until his death in 1987.  Chalmers's most famous work is The Philosophy of Religion, which was first published in two volumes in 1956 and 1960. In it, he argues that all religions are based on a common set of beliefs, and that these beliefs can be summed up in a single concept known as the 'transcendent'. Chalmers is also noted for his work on epistemology and philosophy of language.

The Severan dynasty was a Roman imperial dynasty, which ruled the Roman Empire from 193 to 235. The dynasty was founded by the general Septimius Severus, who rose to power after defeating his rival and former mentor, Pertinax.   The Severan dynasty marked the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and the beginning of the Flavian dynasty. The dynasty was a result of multiple civil wars that had torn the Roman Empire in two from 193-235. The first war was fought between Severus' father, Septimius Severus, and his rival, Pertinax. After winning this war, Severus became the sole ruler of the Roman Empire. He would go on to have three sons: Caracalla, Geta, and Albinus.   The second war was fought between Caracalla and his brother Geta. After a long and bloody battle, Geta was defeated and killed. This led to Caracalla becoming the sole ruler of the Roman Empire. He would go on to have two sons: Alexius I and Commodus.   The third war was fought between Commodus and Albinus. After a long and bloody battle, Albinus was defeated and killed. This led to Commodus becoming the sole ruler of the Roman Empire. He would go on to have two sons: Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus.

Franciscus Haraeus (Latinised form of Franciscus Verhaer; 1575â€“1642) was a Dutch physician and botanist.  He was born in Utrecht, the son of a cloth merchant, and studied at the University of Leiden, where he graduated in 1599. He then travelled in Europe, where he studied at Padua, Ferrara and Vienna. He returned to Leiden in 1611, and in 1615 became professor of medicine at the university.  Haraeus is principally remembered for his work on plants. He published a large number of works on botany, including a New System of Botany (1632), a Flora Japonica (1636), and a Flora Indica (1639). He also compiled an edition of Theophrastus' Botany (1633).

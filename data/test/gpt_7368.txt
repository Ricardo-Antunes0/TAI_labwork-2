Manuel Ramos (November 20, 1942 – June 27, 1990) was an American boxer who competed in the welterweight and middleweight weight classes. He is best known for his upset victory over future world champion Roberto Durán in the 1979 WBA Welterweight Championship bout.  Ramos was born in Brownsville, Texas in 1942. He was a decorated veteran of the United States Marine Corps, serving from 1963 to 1966. Ramos turned professional in 1967 and won his first 21 bouts, including a unanimous decision victory over future world champion Wilfred Benítez.  In 1979, Ramos faced Roberto Durán for the WBA Welterweight Championship. Ramos was considered a long shot to win the bout, as Durán was undefeated and considered one of the best fighters in the world. However, Ramos won by knockout in the tenth round, becoming the first American boxer to win a world title in over fifty years. Ramos lost the title in 1981 to Durán, but later regained it in 1984. He retired from boxing in 1987 with a record of 48-5-2 (27 KOs).  Ramos died of cancer on June 27, 1990 at the age of 54.

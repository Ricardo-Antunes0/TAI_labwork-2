The Atherton House, also known as the Faxon Atherton Mansion, is a historic building in San Francisco, California, United States. History The house was built in 1881–1882 in the Queen Anne style with horizontal lines, a clipped gable, and a short tower. It was constructed for Dominga de Goñi Atherton after the death of her husband Faxon Atherton. She was the mother-in-law of novelist Gertrude Atherton, who wrote about the house in her memoirs. The architect is thought to have been John Marquis, but it has also been attributed to the Moore Brothers, who are depicted in other accounts as the initial builders. Newspaper articles about the house when the housewarming was held in 1882 described it as picturesque, but appearing to be a relic of an earlier time. The reporter also noted that the height of the rooms created a claustrophobic effect on visitors. Possibly in answer to the comments, Dominga hired Charles Lee Tilden to improve the house.

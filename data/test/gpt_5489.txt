Tecno is an Italian kart and former Formula One constructors constructor. The company was founded in 1985 by former Alfa Romeo mechanical engineer Giancarlo Minardi and designer Andrea de Cesaris. Tecno entered Formula One as a constructor for the 1992 season with a team of drivers including Riccardo Patrese and Jean Alesi. The team failed to score a point and after the season, de Cesaris left the team.  Tecno entered Formula 3000 for the 1993 season, with drivers including Marc Surer and JJ Lehto. Tecno also entered sports car racing, winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1995 with driver Michele Alboreto. The following year, Tecno withdrew from Formula 3000 and Alboreto moved to Prodrive. Tecno returned to Formula One in 1998 with a new team, Arrows, which used some of the former Alfa Romeo personnel. Arrows finished eighth in the Constructors' Championship that year.  In 1999, Tecno acquired the assets of the Minardi team after its bankruptcy. Tecno renamed the team Minardi Tecno for the 2000 season, but failed to score a point that year and withdrew from Formula One after the season. Tecno returned to Formula 3000 for 2001 but failed to score points that year either. The team ceased operations at the end of 2002.

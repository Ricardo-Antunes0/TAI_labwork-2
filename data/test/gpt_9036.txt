Blenheim Reef is a partly submerged atoll in the southern Indian Ocean, about midway between the African coast and the Australian mainland. The reef is located in the territory of the United States of America and is administered as part of the Chagos Archipelago National Park.  The atoll is a volcanic island, consisting of an almost circular ring of coral-covered rocks rising to a height of about 2 metres (6.6 ft). It has a diameter of about 1.5 kilometres (0.9 mi). There are two small islands within the reef, North Point and South Point.  Blenheim Reef was first discovered on 9 May 1788 by Captain James Cook during his second voyage of exploration. He named it for the Earl of Blenheim, then British Prime Minister. The atoll was sighted from HMS Endeavour while Cook was sailing between New Zealand and Australia. Cook charted it and named it "Reef Island".  In 1973, following a request from the United States, the United Kingdom transferred sovereignty over Blenheim Reef to the United States as part of the Chagos Archipelago National Park. The atoll was added to the park in 1975. The US military established a military base on North Point in 1978. The base closed in 1999 following a US-Australian agreement to return all of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.

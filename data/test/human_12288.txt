Frank Daniel Garofalo (born April 1, 1944), known professionally as Frank Gari, is an American singer-songwriter and composer. Early life Gari was a popular singer and songwriter from the late 1950s and early 1960s. His best known songs as a performer are "Utopia", "Lullaby of Love", and "Princess", all of which hit the Top 40 in the  U.S. Billboard charts in 1961. Contributing to this early acclaim was Gari's unique rich voice blending with carefully selected melodic instrumentation and backup singers, all of which created a deep sense of magic, ethereal perfection, sincerity and emotion.  With songwriting partner Roger McGuinn of the Byrds, they wrote the song "Beach Ball" while working with singer Bobby Darin. Gari and McGuinn appeared on Capitol Records billed as the City Surfers. Gari performed his records on shows such as The Merv Griffin Show, The Steve Allen Show, and American Bandstand. He also performed at the "Empire Room" of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City with the Woody Herman Band. That year, he moved to Cleveland, becoming a jingle writer for television commercials. Some of his early jingles were for Ohio Bell, Genie garage doors, and early commercials for Wendy's. Gari has won numerous Emmy and Clio awards, and was later honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award from the broadcast industry.

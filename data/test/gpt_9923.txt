Ptolemy, the Greco-Egyptian geographer of Alexandria, wrote a detailed description of the Stone Tower in his work Geography. The tower is thought to be one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.  The Stone Tower is a retaining wall and tower located near Giza, Egypt. It is part of the Giza Necropolis and is situated near the Pyramid of Khufu. The tower is made from limestone blocks and has a height of 83 metres (272 feet). The structure was built during the Ptolemaic period and is thought to have been constructed as a watchtower. The tower was damaged by an earthquake in 365 AD and was later restored by the Roman emperor Heraclius.

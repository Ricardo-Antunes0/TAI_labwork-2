A catalytic converter is an exhaust emission control device that converts the harmful pollutants in an automobile exhaust gas into less harmful substances before they are released into the atmosphere.  Catalytic converters were originally invented as a way to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are responsible for many health problems, including respiratory illness, eye irritation, and cancer. Catalytic converters have since been adapted to also eliminate other pollutants, such as hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide.

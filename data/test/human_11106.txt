In set theory, a branch of mathematics, the axiom of uniformization is a weak form of the axiom of choice. It states that if  is a subset of , where  and  are Polish spaces, then there is a subset  of  that is a partial function from  to , and whose domain (the set of all  such that  exists) equals   Such a function is called a uniformizing function for , or a uniformization of . To see the relationship with the axiom of choice, observe that  can be thought of as associating, to each element of , a subset of .  A uniformization of  then picks exactly one element from each such subset, whenever the subset is non-empty.  Thus, allowing arbitrary sets X and Y (rather than just Polish spaces) would make the axiom of uniformization equivalent to the axiom of choice.

Caquenga's Revolt was a revolt that occurred in the early 16th century in the Andes region of northern Peru. The revolt was led by Caquenga, an Andean nobleman who sought to overturn the traditional Inca political order and install his own dynasty.  The revolt began in 1493, when Caquenga and his followers attacked Paucartambo, a prominent Inca city located in the Cusco Region. The rebels were successful in their initial attacks, but were eventually defeated by the Inca army. Caquenga was killed in battle, and the rebellion was ultimately unsuccessful.

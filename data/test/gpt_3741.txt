Basic hostility is a psychological concept first proposed in the 1970s by Robert Cialdini, a professor at Arizona State University. It suggests that humans are inherently hostile, and that this hostility can be activated by a variety of situations or stimuli.  According to basic hostility theory, humans are inherently hostile and can be aroused by a variety of situations or stimuli. This hostility can lead to negative behaviors, such as aggression and violence.  Basic hostility theory has been widely used to understand various forms of aggression and violence. For example, it has been used to explain why people commit crimes, why people are more likely to engage in conflict, and why people are more likely to react negatively to different groups of people.  Basic hostility theory has also been used to develop interventions designed to reduce aggression and violence. For example, basic hostility interventions may be used to reduce crime rates by targeting the underlying hostility in individuals.

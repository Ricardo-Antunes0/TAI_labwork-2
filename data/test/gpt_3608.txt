Susan Louise Quittmeyer (born 1953) is an American mathematician and computer scientist. She is a professor at the University of Utah in the Department of Computer Science, where she also directs the Women in Computer Science program.  Quittmeyer's research focuses on algorithmic problems in combinatorics and graph theory, with a particular focus on drawing connections between these fields and computer science. She is particularly known for her work on the asymptotic behaviour of algorithms and the study of efficient algorithms for graph problems.  Quittmeyer received her Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1984 under the supervision of Carl Hewitt. She was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University before joining the University of Utah faculty in 1985.

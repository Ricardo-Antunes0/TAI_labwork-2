John Marion Riddle (born 1937) is an American historian and specialist in the history of medicine. He is Alumni Distinguished Professor emeritus of History at North Carolina State University and a specialist in the history of medicine. Career Riddle specializes in pharmacological history particularly of the classical and medieval periods, based on previously under-utilized ancient and medieval sources. His methodology is to draw on the modern understanding of medicine, pharmacy, and chemistry to interpret texts and uncover the rationality of early medicine. He has written extensively about Dioscorides, who published a description of 500 distinct plants around 78 AD that is "still an authority on plants and drugs of ancient times" â€“ it was "the first to study [plants] morphologically thus separating phamacognosy from medicine."  Riddle demonstrated that Dioscorides arranged his presentation of drugs by affinities and based on their physiological action. This allowed a physician who did not have a particular drug to look to the preceding or following entries for potential alternatives.

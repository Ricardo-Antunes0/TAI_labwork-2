Midas Touch: Why Some Entrepreneurs Get Rich and Others Don't (2005) is a book by business author and journalist Charles Duhigg. The book examines the phenomenon of "the Midas touch", which refers to the ability of some people to achieve great financial success despite generally unfavorable circumstances.  The book begins with a description of Duhigg's own experience as an impoverished young man who was able to overcome his struggles through hard work and perseverance. He then discusses several cases in which individuals who seemingly had little chance of success turned out to be some of the richest and most successful people in the world.  The book concludes with a discussion of how to develop the Midas touch yourself, as well as advice for those who are trying to help others achieve success.

Caladenia minorata, commonly known as the small waxlip orchid, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to eastern Australia. It is a ground orchid with a single very hairy leaf and one or two deep violet-blue flowers. It has been known as Glossodia minor since its description by the prolific Scottish botanist Robert Brown in 1810, but recent discoveries suggest its inclusion in the genus Caladenia. It is similar to Caladenia major (formerly Glossodia major) but is smaller in all its parts. Description Caladenia minorata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. It has a single dark green, very hairy, egg-shaped leaf,  long and  wide, lying flat on the ground. One or deep violet-blue, rarely white flowers,  long and wide are borne on a spike  tall. The outer surface of the sepals and petals is light coloured and hairy. The dorsal sepal is  long and  wide. The lateral sepals have similar dimensions to the dorsal sepal and spread apart from each other. The petals are  long and  wide and spread widely. The labellum is an elongated heart shape,  long,  wide, bluish-purple with a white tip and with a furrow near its base. At the base of the labellum there are two large, club-shaped calli joined at their bases, each with a fleshy black top. Flowering occurs from July to October, more prolifically after bushfire.

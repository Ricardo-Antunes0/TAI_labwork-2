Crazy Quilt (also known as Indian Carpet, Indian Rug, or Rainbow Quilt) is a traditional quilt made up of squares of various colors. It is usually made as a bedspread, but can also be used as a wall hanging or as part of a quilt top.  The quilt is composed of squares of various sizes and shapes, where each square is made up of several smaller squares. The quilt is often started with a light background color and built up layer by layer, with each new color adding a new design element to the quilt. Crazy quilts are often very colorful and intricate, and can feature different types of stitches, such as piecing, cross-hatching, and appliqu√©.

Cooley is a surname of Anglo-Saxon and Irish origin. It is most common in the counties of Mayo and Galway in Ireland, as well as in the United States. The name is derived from the Old English word cūl or cūle meaning 'a hollow, a valley', plus the Old Irish word coille meaning 'a wood'.   The Cooley family is one of the oldest and most distinguished in Ireland. The earliest ancestor of the Cooley family is believed to be one Gobnait, who lived in County Mayo during the 10th century. The Cooley family first came to prominence in the mid-16th century, when one of their members, Donal Cooley, was appointed Archbishop of Tuam. The Cooley family also played a significant role in Irish history during the 17th century, when several members were involved in the Irish Confederate Wars.

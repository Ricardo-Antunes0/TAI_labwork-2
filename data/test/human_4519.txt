Angary (Lat. jus angariae; Fr. droit d'angarie; Ger. Angarie; from the Gr. , angareia, "the office of an  (courier or messenger)") is the name given to the right of a belligerent (most commonly, a government or other party in conflict) to seize and apply, for the purposes of war or to prevent the enemy from doing so, any kind of property on belligerent territory including what may belong to subjects or citizens of a neutral state. Article 53 of the Regulations respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, annexed to the Hague Convention of 1899 on the same subject, provides that railway plant, land telegraphs, telephones, steamers and other ships (other than such as are governed by maritime law), though belonging to companies or private persons, may be used for military operations but "must be restored at the conclusion of peace and indemnities paid for them." Article 54 adds that "the plant of railways coming from neutral states, whether the property of those states or of companies or private persons, shall be sent back to them as soon as possible."

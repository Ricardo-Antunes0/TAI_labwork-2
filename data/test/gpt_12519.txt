FSC Millport, run by the Field Studies Council, is a world-leading research and education centre for forestry and forest management. The Centre has a strong international reputation for its research in silviculture, forest economics, forest products science, ecology and landscape management.   FSC Millport was founded in 1969 as the Scottish Forestry Research Centre (SFRC), with the first research projects directed at improving the management of Scots pine forests. The Centre grew rapidly, becoming an independent body in 1984. It was renamed the Field Studies Council (FSC) Millport in 1989 to reflect its expanded remit and prominence within the forestry sector.   Today FSC Millport is home to a wide range of research programmes covering all aspects of forestry and forest management. The Centreâ€™s research teams are internationally recognised for their expertise in silviculture, forest economics, forest products science, ecology and landscape management.   The FSC Millport campus covers over 50 hectares of woodland and field and is situated just outside Falkirk on the eastern banks of the River Forth. The Centre has a strong international reputation for its work on climate change, biodiversity and sustainable forest management.

Sebaceous carcinoma, also known as sebaceous gland carcinoma, is a type of skin cancer that occurs in the sebaceous glands. It is the most common type of skin cancer, and the fourth most common cancer in the world. Sebaceous carcinoma can occur on any part of the body, but is most commonly found on the face, neck, chest, and back. Sebaceous carcinoma is usually diagnosed when it begins to grow or change, or when it causes pain or difficulty in moving. Treatment for sebaceous carcinoma depends on the stage of the cancer, but may include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

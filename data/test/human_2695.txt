Robert S. Smith (February 7, 1932 â€“ July 27, 2010) was an American Catholic priest, author, and educator. His interests ranged from philosophy and theology to the ethics of medical care to interfaith dialogue.  Smith's homilies explored the mystery and challenge of religious faith, the relationship between modern culture and the struggle to pursue Christian life, and the paradoxical, complex nature of the spiritual journey.  He founded the Sophia Center, devoted to engendering discourse among diverse scientific, cultural, and religious perspectives.  He was the author of In the Image of God. Early life and education Born on February 7, 1932 in St. Albans, New York, a neighborhood in Queens, Smith attended St Francis Prep High School, and Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception.  Smith studied for the priesthood at the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, New York, becoming ordained on May 31, 1958. In that same year, he pursued graduate studies in philosophy at the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, completing them in 1961, whereupon he became associate pastor at St. Lawrence Martyr in Sayville, New York.

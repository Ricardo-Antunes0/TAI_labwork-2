Leander was a composite built clipper ship. She was launched on 16 September 1853 from the yard of J. & W. R. Muntz in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and completed in December 1853. She was then registered in New York on 15 January 1854 with a gross register tonnage of 2,209 tons, and a net register tonnage of 1,829 tons.  Leander was the first ship built in the United States specifically for the California trade. Her maiden voyage took her from New York to San Francisco in December 1853. Leander was one of the most successful clippers of her time, making thirteen voyages to California between 1853 and 1861. In 1861 she was sold to the Chilean government and renamed Santiago. She served in the Chilean navy until 1865 when she was sold to a French company and converted into a coal hulk at Marseilles. She was eventually broken up in 1906.

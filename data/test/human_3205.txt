The 110th Grey Cup will be played to decide the Canadian Football League (CFL) championship for the 2023 season. The game is scheduled to be played at Tim Hortons Field in Hamilton, Ontario. It will be the 12th time that Hamilton has hosted the Grey Cup, with the most recent being in 2021. The game will be televised in Canada nationally on TSN and RDS. Host On October 14, 2021, it was announced that the game had been awarded to the city of Hamilton. Hamilton was awarded the game only two years after being the host of the 108th Grey Cup because for the 2021 championship game they were compelled to cancel many of the usual festivities associated with the Grey Cup (and scale back most of the festivities which could be held) on account of restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. It will be the shortest time frame for a repeat host since Vancouver hosted the 74th and 75th Grey Cups in 1986 and 1987.

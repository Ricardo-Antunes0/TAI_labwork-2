Project Prevention (formerly Children Requiring a Caring Environment or CORE) is a nationwide initiative in the United States aimed at preventing child abuse and neglect.  The initiative was founded in 1994 by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Justice, and is now a national program operated by more than 1,000 partner agencies throughout the United States.  Project Prevention's goal is to prevent child abuse and neglect through public awareness and training of professionals, victim services, community outreach, and partnerships with law enforcement. The program also provides resources to families who have children in need of protective services, as well as financial assistance for expenses associated with raising a child in a safe environment.  Since its inception, Project Prevention has helped to protect more than 2 million children from abuse or neglect.

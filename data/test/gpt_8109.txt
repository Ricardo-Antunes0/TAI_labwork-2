"Bill" Davidson and Gordon Lacey as a small collection of animals on the grounds of the University of Alberta. In its early years, much of the zoo's success was due to the generosity of local citizens and businesses who supported the zoo's expansion. In 1977, the Valley Zoo Company (later renamed Edmonton Valley Zoo Company Ltd.) was incorporated and became responsible for the day-to-day management and operation of the zoo.  In 2000, the Valley Zoo celebrated its 50th anniversary with a grand opening ceremony that included a performance by The Tragically Hip and a visit from then-prime minister Jean Chr√©tien. In 2002, construction began on an all-new animal exhibit which was completed in 2003. This new exhibit features more than 1,000 animals from all over Africa and Asia.  In 2007, Edmonton Valley Zoo celebrated its 60th anniversary with a special event including a concert by Barenaked Ladies and a visit from then-prime minister Stephen Harper. That same year, the zoo opened Canada's first ever polar bear exhibit

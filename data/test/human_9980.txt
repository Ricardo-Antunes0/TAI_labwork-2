Synodontis filamentosus, known as the longfin synodontis,  is a species of upside-down catfish that is native to the basins of the Nile, Volta and Niger Rivers as well as the Chad Basin.  It was first described by British-Belgian zoologist George Albert Boulenger in 1901, from specimens obtained near the mouth of Lake No, on the White Nile in Sudan.  The species name filamentosus comes from the elongated rays of the dorsal and caudal fins. Description  Like all members of the genus Synodontis, S. filamentosus has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin.  The head contains a distinct narrow, bony, external protrusion called a humeral process. The shape and size of the humeral process helps to identify the species. In S. filamentosus, the humeral process is flat, a little longer than it is broad, and rounded at the end.

Rigging in entertainment can be broken down into three main categories: stage rigging, film rigging, and television rigging.  Stage rigging is used to manipulate the appearance of a theatrical performance. This can involve everything from moving scenery to changing the height of props on a stage. Film rigging is used to create the appearance of movement and action in films. This can involve everything from adjusting the timing of shots to altering the camera angles. Television rigging is used to adjust the appearance of a television program or scene. This can involve everything from adjusting the brightness of a screen to altering the color of a background.

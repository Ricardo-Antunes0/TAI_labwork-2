Eighth grade (or grade eight in some countries) is the final grade of elementary school. It is also the second year of middle school in some countries. The eighth grade is a stage of life where students are transitioning from childhood to adolescence. They are becoming more independent and are learning how to make their own decisions. They are also becoming more aware of their feelings and thoughts.

City mysteries are a 19th-century genre of detective fiction, typically set in large cities. The central mystery is usually a murder, and the detective is usually a member of the police force.  The genre owes its popularity to the works of Edgar Allan Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, and other writers of detective fiction.

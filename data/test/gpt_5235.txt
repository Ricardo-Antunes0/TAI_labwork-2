Pete (also called Peg-Leg Pete, Pistol Pete, and Old Pete) is a character from the 1937 Disney animated film, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs". He is a mischievous and cowardly dwarf who works for Snow White's stepmother, Fritzi.  Pete is one of the more minor characters in the film, but his comic relief makes him a popular favorite with fans. He is voiced by Bill Farmer in the original movie and by Don Messick in later appearances.

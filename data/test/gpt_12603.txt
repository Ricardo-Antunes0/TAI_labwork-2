The Orphaned Starfish Foundation (OSF) is a non-profit organization that helps injured and orphaned sea stars. The organization was founded in 1992 by Dr. Deborah L. Martin and Dr. David M.owitz, who realized the need for help after observing a large number of injured and orphaned sea stars on the California coastline.  The Orphaned Starfish Foundation works to protect and restore sea stars by providing them with food, shelter, and medical care. The organization also educates the public about the importance of sea stars and their role in the marine environment.  The Orphaned Starfish Foundation is headquartered in La Jolla, California.

Harold Arthur "Hal" Peck (April 20, 1917 â€“ November 6, 1987) was an American composer and musician who was a pioneer in electronic music and the use of computers in music composition.  Peck was born in Newark, New Jersey, and began his musical training at the age of nine, studying violin with Gustave Leduc. He continued his studies at the Juilliard School of Music, where he studied with Roger Sessions and David Diamond. In 1941, he joined the United States Air Force and served in Europe during World War II.  After the war, Peck resumed his musical career, working with composers such as Darius Milhaud and Paul Hindemith. He also composed electronic music, which was at the time controversial due to its unique soundscape. In 1968, he founded the Electronic Music Studio at MIT, which became one of the world's leading centres for electronic music composition.  Peck died in 1987 at the age of 70. His compositions have been performed around the world, and he has been awarded numerous awards including a Guggenheim Fellowship and a MacArthur Fellowship.

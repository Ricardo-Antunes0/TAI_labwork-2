Adele Collins (January 24, 1908 – March 7, 1996) was a 20th-century Native American painter. She was born in Blanchard, Oklahoma and was a registered member of the Chickasaw Nation with Choctaw and Irish descent. Collins moved fluidly between representational and abstraction in her paintings, depicting an array of events and themes combining her Chickasaw and Choctaw heritage with contemporary European modernist approaches. Rennard Strickland, a professor of law who was also a curator of Native American Art, placed Adele Collins in the first wave of post-World War II Native American painters, along with other notable artists who hail from Five Civilized Tribes: Joe Waano-Grano, Woody Cochran, and Howard Collins. Life  Collins (née Victor) was born in Blanchard, Oklahoma. Her family moved between homes in Blanchard and Lindsay, Oklahoma, during the early years of Collins's life. Her father, Emmett L. Victor (1875-1932), was Chickasaw and Choctaw, and her mother, Lee Desmond (1880-1954), was Irish. Both of Desmond's parents were allotted land in McClain County, Oklahoma. Her father used the family lands as a rancher and a farmer and gave Adele and her three siblings a prosperous childhood. Born two years after the closing of the Dawes Commission Chickasaw Rolls, Adele did not receive an allotment for herself.

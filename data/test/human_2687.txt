Solution architecture, term used in information technology with various definitions such as; "A description of a discrete and focused business operation or activity and how IS/IT supports that operation". Definitions The Open Group's definition of Solution Architecture, as provided above, is accompanied by the following three from Scaled Agile, Gartner and Greefhorst/Proper. It is worth noting that the Open Group does not recognize the role "Solution Architect" in its TOGAF skills framework whilst Glassdoor advertised 55,000 Solution Architect roles in August 2020.   Scaled agile (2020) Solution Architect/Engineering is responsible for defining and communicating a shared technical and architectural vision across a "Solution Train" to help ensure the system or Solution under development is fit for its intended purpose.  Gartner (2013)  A solution architecture (SA) is an architectural description of a specific solution. SAs combine guidance from different enterprise architecture viewpoints (business, information and technical), as well as from the enterprise solution architecture (ESA).  Greefhorst and Proper (2013) An architecture of a solution, where a solution is a system that offers a coherent set of functionalities to its environment. As such, it concerns those properties of a solution that are necessary and sufficient to meet its essential requirements A typical property of Solution Architecture, in contrast to other flavours of Enterprise Architecture, is that it often seeks to define a solution within the context of a project or initiative. This close association to actual projects and initiatives means that solution architecture is the means to execute or realise a technology strategy.

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development.  The HDI was developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1990, and is currently the most widely used human development index. The original objectives of the HDI were to provide a single statistic for measuring the progress of equality and human development, and to provide a comparative measure for monitoring global change.  The HDI is a measure of the relative level of human development of countries. The higher the HDI score, the higher the level of human development. The 2017 Human Development Report produced by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) found that while there has been significant progress made in reducing poverty and increasing life expectancy around the world since 1990, more work needs to be done to achieve more equitable and sustainable human development.   In 2014, Iceland was ranked first in the world with a HDI score of 0.9753, while Niger was ranked last with a HDI score of 0.4641.

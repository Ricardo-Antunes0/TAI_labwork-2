The Banqueting House is an 18th-century building, now a national monument, in the Gibside Estate near Carstairs, Cumbria, England. It was built for and used by the British Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole, as a place to entertain his contemporaries.  The Banqueting House is a large three-storey Jacobean mansion with a half-timbered frontage, built on the site of an earlier house, possibly dating from the 14th century. Walpole commissioned the architect James Gibbs to design it in 1724â€“5. It was not completed until 1734, and its decoration was not completed until 1738. After Walpole's death it was used as a country house by successive Prime Ministers until 1814. It then became the Royal Military College (RMC), but was closed in 1969. The building is open to the public and has been used for various functions including banquets, concerts and receptions.  The Banqueting House stands in extensive grounds on Gibside Fell, a prominent hill near Carstairs in Cumbria. The estate includes a manor house, farm buildings, gamekeepers' lodge and other outbuildings. The Banqueting House is set in parkland and gardens that were laid out by Capability Brown in the early 18th century. The house is approached via an avenue of lime trees leading to an elaborate formal entrance gate with a stone archway flanked by Ionic columns.   The Banqueting House occupies two floors above ground level

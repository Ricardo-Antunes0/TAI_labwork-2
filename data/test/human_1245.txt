Stanisław Kowalski (born 14 April 1910) is a Polish supercentenarian masters athlete who, at the age of 105, became the oldest ever competing athlete in the newly formed M105 age division (105 years and older) in sprinting, shot put and discus throw. Early life Kowalski was born on 14 April 1910 in the village of Rogówek, then part of Congress Poland within the Russian Empire, where he lived until the end of the 1930s. After his marriage, he moved to Brzeźnica. In 1952, due to the broadening of the boundaries of the military training ground, he had to move out of his newly built house and live in Lower Silesia, in the village of Krzydlina Wielka, where he ran a small farm and worked as a railroad lineman. He has been living in Świdnica since 1979. Kowalski's mother lived to be 99. For decades, Kowalski rode to work on a bicycle regardless of the weather outside.

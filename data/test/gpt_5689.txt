The Lafitte Projects were one of the most ambitious and successful crime syndicates in history. Originating in New Orleans, the syndicate was led by Jean Lafitte, a skilled naval officer and smuggler.  The Lafitte Projects operated from the early 1800s until the early 1900s, when their activities were disrupted by the American government. The syndicate is famous for its smuggling operations and its involvement in piracy. It is estimated that the Lafitte Projects were responsible for smuggling more than $200 million worth of goods into and out of the United States during its existence.  The Lafitte Projects have been the subject of many books and movies, including The Pirates of Penzance and The French Connection. They are also prominently featured in the HBO series Boardwalk Empire.

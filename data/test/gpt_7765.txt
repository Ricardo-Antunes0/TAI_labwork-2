Astley Bridge Mill or Holden Mill is a watermill on the River Astley in the Borough of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England. It is a Grade II* listed building.  The mill was built in 1786 by James Holden and is said to be the last watermill to be built in Wakefield. The mill was used to grind corn for flour until the 1970s, when it was converted into a visitor centre and exhibition space.   Today, the mill is operated by Wakefield Council as a museum and art gallery. The mill has been used for filming scenes for TV programmes such as Midsomer Murders and Doctor Who.

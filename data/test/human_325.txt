Kscope is an independent record label that is part of Snapper Music, and a sister-label of Peaceville. It is dedicated to artists in the progressive rock genre. The label has released albums by Steven Wilson and his projects Porcupine Tree (mostly re-issue only), No-Man and Blackfield. In 2008 it branched out and has since signed the post-progressive artists Anathema, Lunatic Soul and Ulver, and progressive rock stalwart Ian Anderson to their roster. In 2013, the Steven Wilson release The Raven That Refused to Sing (and Other Stories) received the Album of the Year award at the Progressive Music Awards. History  Established in the late 1990s, the label was initially used exclusively by Wilson and Porcupine Tree. In this first incarnation, Kscope was featured as an outlet for the 1999 album Stupid Dream, with Snapper Music as the distributor. It was followed by Lightbulb Sun in 2000 and a collection of left-over material Recordings. After the band signed up with Atlantic Records in 2002, the name was used for Wilson's side projects. This included the albums Together We're Stranger (2003) and the re-issue of the Flowermouth (2005) by No-Man. It also released Blackfield (2004) and Blackfield II (2007)â€”a collaboration with Aviv Geffen.

Modesta Sanginés Uriarte (26 February 1832 – 5 February 1887) was one of the principal composers in 19th century Bolivia. Writing over fifty compositions, her works were published in 2015. In addition to composing, Sanginés worked as a journalist writing articles to benefit women and published legends of her native country. Her philanthropic works provided social services for the elderly, orphans and poor, building a hospital wing to care for those who were unable to provide for themselves. She also used her musical talents to raise funds to assist the wounded and prisoners of war during the war between Bolivia, Chile and Peru over control of the Pacific coast of South America. Early life Modesta Cesárea Sanginés Uriarte was born on 26 February 1832 in La Paz, Bolivia to Manuela Uriarte Sagárnaga and Indalecio Sanginés y Calderón. Though customs of the time restricted education to men, Sanginés' parents enrolled her in a school which had recently been created by Dámasa Cabezón, a Chilean educator. Cabezón had founded a school for women, which was successful in Chile, and at the invitation of the government of Bolivia was asked to found a school in La Paz in 1845, which operated for three years. Sanginés entered the school and studied French and Italian languages, the arts and music. She was particularly talented on the piano and often gave recitals in tandem with Adolfo Ballivián, who would later become president of Bolivia. Sanginés chose not to marry, though she had suitors, preferring to keep her freedom. When her parents died, she maintained her own home, rather than moving in with her brother, as was customary.

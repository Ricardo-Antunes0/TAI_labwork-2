The city of Galway Ireland was built on an important strategic location at the mouth of the River Corrib. From its earliest days, Galway was a center for trade and commerce. In the 12th century, Galway became an important port for the Irish Sea trade.   The city was besieged three times in its history. The first siege occurred in 1212 when the city was captured by forces loyal to King John of England. The second siege occurred in 1318 when an English army led by the Earl of Ulster captured the city. The third siege occurred in 1641 when an Irish Catholic army led by Hugh O'Neill captured the city. In all three cases, the city was eventually recaptured by forces loyal to the Crown.  The Siege of Galway is one of Ireland's most famous historical events. It is also one of Ireland's longest-running sieges, lasting for more than eighteen months.

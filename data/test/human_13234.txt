The Aurora mine is the largest integrated phosphate mining and chemical plant in the world. The mine is located in Richland Township, in Aurora in Beaufort County, North Carolina. The mine which is owned since 1995 by PotashCorp, the world's largest potash producer and the second and third largest producer of nitrogen and phosphate, has an annual production capacity of over six million tonnes of phosphate ore. In 2008 the mine produced 6.6 million tonnes of phosphate ore from which 1.3 million tonnes of phosphoric acid was produced. History The phosphates of the Aurora mine are the result of a recession experienced by the sea coast of Aurora. Phosphates were deposited into the sea about 15 million years ago. The result was a phosphate ore zone with  of low-grade phosphate sand blanketed by sand silt. The ore zone is estimated to be about  thick, consisting of phosphate sand, fine quartz, clay and silt. PotashCorp bought the Aurora mine in 1995 from the Texas Gulf Sulphur Company as its first phosphate operation, and purchased the agricultural products division of Occidental Chemicals six months later.

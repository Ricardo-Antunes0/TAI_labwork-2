Robinwood is an exclusive residential section of Little Rock, Arkansas, located in the east-central part of the city. It is bounded by Interstate 40 to the west, Holt Road to the north, Broadway to the east, and Skinker Boulevard to the south. The section was developed in the early 1990s as a suburban extension of Little Rock.  Robinwood is named for its Robinwood Drive, which runs through it. The name is derived from the Robinwood Estate, a large country estate that was home to several prominent Little Rock families in the early 20th century. The estate was acquired by developer Don Hagerman and Associates in the early 1990s and subdivided into small lots for development.  The section is mostly single-family homes, with a few apartment complexes and a few commercial businesses. The streets are lined with large oak and maple trees. The section is generally safe and quiet, and has a reputation for being one of the most exclusive areas in Little Rock.  There are several schools in Robinwood: Gibbs Middle School (6-8), John F. Kennedy High School (9-12), and Parkview Academy (preschool-8th grade).

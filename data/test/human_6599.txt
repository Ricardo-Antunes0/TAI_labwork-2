Open Referral in private medical insurance refers to the practice of General Practitioner referring patients to any consultant with a particular speciality for treatment rather than explicitly naming a specific consultant. The insurance company will then choose a consultant that has the speciality specified from an approved list that they maintain or offer a choice of two or three consultants from this list for the patient to decide between. History  Open Referral was first introduced on a widespread scale in the UK by Bupa, the largest private medical insurer by subscription income, who adopted this system for schemes offered to their large corporate clients from 1 January 2012. Several other large insurance companies have since introduced similar schemes including Axa PPP and Aviva, the second and third largest private medical insurers respectively. Larger insurance companies can use such a scheme to negotiate discounts with consultants who wish to be included on their approved list, based on the significant volume of purchase they are making. BUPA, AXA PPP and Aviva account for over 78% of the total private medical insurance market in the UK between them, as measured by subscription income. Not being included on the lists of these insurance companies could result in a "significant shortfall in demand" for healthcare providers according to Laing's Healthcare Market Review 2010-11.

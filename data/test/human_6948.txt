In aviation, a class rating is an allowance to fly a certain group of aircraft that require training common to all aircraft within the group. A type rating is specified if a particular aircraft requires additional specialized training beyond the scope of initial license and aircraft class training. Which aircraft require a type rating is decided by the local aviation authority. Almost all single engine piston (SEP) or multi engine piston (MEP) single pilot aircraft can be flown without a type rating, but are covered by a class rating instead. In the United States, all turbojets require a type rating. Aircraft with a maximum take-off weight of more than 12,500 pounds typically require a type rating. There are seven categories of aircraft, which contain the following classes:  airplane category  single-engine piston land class  multi-engine piston land class  single-engine piston sea class  multi-engine piston sea class  rotorcraft category  helicopter class  gyroplane class  powered lift category  glider category  lighter than air category  airship class   balloon class  powered parachute category  powered parachute land class  powered parachute sea class  weight-shift-control aircraft category  weight-shift-control aircraft land class  weight-shift-control aircraft sea class

Anthony Michael Brumley (born April 9, 1963) is an American former professional baseball utility player in Major League Baseball (MLB), who played primarily as a shortstop. He played from 1987 through 1995 for the Cubs (1987), Detroit Tigers (1989), Seattle Mariners (1990), Boston Red Sox (1991â€“1992), Houston Astros (1993, 1995) and Oakland Athletics (1994). Brumley was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed. He was the assistant hitting coach for the Chicago Cubs in 2014. He is the son of the catcher Mike Brumley. Playing career Brumley played for six different teams in a span of eight seasons. A late-inning defensive specialist, he was able to play all positions except pitcher and catcher. His most productive season came in 1989 with the Detroit Tigers, when he posted career-highs in games played (92), at bats (212), runs (33), hits (42), doubles (5), runs batted in (RBIs) (11) and stolen bases (4). Brumley was dealt from the Tigers to the Baltimore Orioles for Larry Sheets on January 10, 1990 in a transaction where he was headed to a team sacrificing a much-needed power hitter for a younger, less expensive player. He never played a regular season game with the Orioles who released him on April 3, just six days prior to the start of the 1990 campaign. Brumley was a .206 hitter with three home runs and 38 RBIs in 295 games.

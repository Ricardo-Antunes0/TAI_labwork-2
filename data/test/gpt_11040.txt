The Globotype is a colour display for computers and other electronic equipment. It was first introduced in the early 1970s and became popular due to its low price and wide availability.  The Globotype was an early color display device that used three light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to produce colors. The device was originally designed for use in computer displays, but eventually became popular with printers, calculators, and other electronic equipment. The Globotype was discontinued in the late 1990s, but has been revived in recent years as a low-cost alternative to more expensive color displays.

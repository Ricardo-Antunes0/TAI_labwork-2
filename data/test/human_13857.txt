Seymour Lester Shapiro (1916 - 1961) was an organic chemist best known for his pioneering work on a class of drugs used to treat symptoms of adult-onset diabetes.  Phenformin was marketed under the name "DBI" until it was taken off the market after being linked to increased incidence of lactic acidosis, a potentially fatal condition. Shapiro was born in New York City, New York, on October 1, 1916.  After graduation at age 14 from the storied Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn, New York) in 1931, he entered Brooklyn College where he majored in Chemistry and received the degree of Bachelor of Science in June 1935 at the age of 19.  In 1934 while a junior in Brooklyn College, he tied for first place in a citywide contest in handling difficult problems of calculus.  He completed the degree of Master of Science in June 1937 at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute (now part of New York University), New York.  His thesis, "Equimolecular Condensation of Aldehydes with Phenols" was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS) in 1937.

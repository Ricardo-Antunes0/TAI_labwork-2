Bahman Jādhūyah/Jādūyah (also Jādhōē/Jādōē; New Persian: ), or Bahman Jādhawayh (Middle Persian: Vahūman Ĵādaggōw) was an Iranian general of the Sasanians. He is mostly known to have led the Sasanians to victory against the Arabs at the Battle of the Bridge. The Arab Muslims referred to Bahman as Dhul Hājib ("owner of bushy eyebrows"). He had a reputation for being anti-Arab. He is often confused with Mardanshah, another Sasanian general. Biography  Nothing is known of his early life, but Bahman Jadhuyih is recorded as an old man by 634. Bahman may have been the son of the Sasanian commander Hormozd Jadhuyih. Bahman is first mentioned in 633, as one of the spokesmen for the Sasanians and a member of the Parsig faction led by Piruz Khosrow. In 633, the Sasanian monarch ordered a Sasanian commander named Andarzaghar who was in charge of protecting the borders of Khorasan to protect the western frontiers from the Arabs who were plundering Iran.

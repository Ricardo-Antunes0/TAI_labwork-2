Lim was born in 1971 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to a Chinese-Malaysian father and a mother of Irish descent. She moved to Australia with her family when she was five years old and grew up in Sydney. After completing her undergraduate studies at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Lim completed a postgraduate diploma in art from the University of Sydney in 2002.  Lim's work is characterised by its use of video, performance and installation as mediums for exploring issues of identity, race, sexuality and gender. Her early works dealt with themes of displacement and nostalgia, while more recent pieces have examined the intersections between identity, culture and politics. Lim is known for her exploration of notions of home and exile, as well as her complex use of image, gesture and sound.

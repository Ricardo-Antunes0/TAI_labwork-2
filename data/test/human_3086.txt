The Göhrde murders in the Göhrde State Forest in Lower Saxony were two double murders, which in the summer of 1989 caused a sensation throughout Western Germany and today are regarded as spectacular criminal cases. Within a few weeks, two couples in the same forest area of the Göhrde were murdered, probably by the same perpetrator. The second double murder took place while the Kriminalpolizei (Criminal Investigation Department) were only a few hundred metres away, securing forensic identification of the first crime. The forest area was then avoided by walkers and excursionists for almost 30 years, and the cases remain unexplained. At the end of December 2017, the Lower Saxony Police announced that they had already determined that the cemetery gardener Kurt-Werner Wichmann, who had committed suicide in 1993, was a high-risk perpetrator, who was probably a serial killer who had committed further murders. This was achieved with the result of a DNA test of two hairs. The investigators also suspect another previously unknown person to be linked to the killings (and possibly other deeds) as an accomplice.

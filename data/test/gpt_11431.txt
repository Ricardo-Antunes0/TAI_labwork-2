Chicago City Hall is a 10-story building located at 111 S. Michigan Avenue in the heart of downtown Chicago. The building is the headquarters of the City of Chicago government. The Chicago City Council meets in the building's ballroom on the first floor.  Chicago City Hall was designed by New York City architect Harrison Brown, and construction began in 1927. The building was dedicated on May 15, 1929. The building has an exterior of limestone, granite, and terra cotta with a slate roof.  The building originally had a grand entrance on Michigan Avenue, which was replaced in 1986 with a ceremonial entrance on Washington Street. The former main entrance has been converted into a public lobby.  Chicago City Hall's interior is decorated with marble, bronze, and mosaics from around the world. The building contains two art galleries: the Chicago History Museum on the first floor and the Chicago Center for Architecture on the tenth floor. The Chicago History Museum has collections of art from Africa, Asia, Oceania, and Europe, while the Chicago Center for Architecture has collections of modern and contemporary architecture.

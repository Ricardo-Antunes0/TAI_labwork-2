Kepler-41 or KOI-196 is a star in the constellation Lyra. It is an extrasolar planet discovered by the Kepler space telescope in 2013. The planet is about the size of Earth and has an estimated surface temperature of about 150 degrees Celsius.  Kepler-41 is one of the few known planets in the habitable zone around a star similar to the Sun. It was found using a technique called radial velocity, which measures how much a star wobbles as it moves around its host galaxy.

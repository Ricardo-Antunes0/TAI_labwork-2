The 2019 Indanan bombings occurred on 28 January 2019 when a series of coordinated bombings and shootings took place in the city of Indanan in the Indonesian province of Central Sulawesi. At least 45 people were killed and more than 100 were injured in the attacks, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in Indonesia since the 2002 Bali bombings.   The bombings are thought to have been carried out by members of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) as part of its ongoing effort to establish a caliphate in Southeast Asia. The Indonesian government has declared a state of emergency across Central Sulawesi and is investigating whether ISIS was behind the bombings.

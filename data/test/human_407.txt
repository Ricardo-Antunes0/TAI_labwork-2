A web-based experiment or Internet-based experiment  is an experiment that is conducted over the Internet. In such experiments, the Internet is either "a medium through which to target larger and more diverse samples with reduced administrative and financial costs" or "a field of social science research in its own right." Psychology and Internet studies are probably the disciplines that have used these experiments most widely, although a range of other disciplines including political science and economics also use web-based experiments. Within psychology most web-based experiments are conducted in the areas of cognitive psychology and social psychology. This form of experimental setup has become increasingly popular because researchers can cheaply collect large amounts of data from a wider range of locations and people. A web-based experiment is a type of online research method. Web based experiments have become significantly more widespread since the COVID-19 pandemic, as researchers have been unable to conduct lab-based experiments. Introduction  Experiments are an integral part of research, however, their integration with the Internet has been gradual. There are three main categories of experiments:  Controlled experiments, done in a laboratory setting, attempt to control for all variables then test for a single effect.  Natural experiments, conducted after a large-scale event which was prohibitively difficult or impossible to control, collect as many variables as possible then draw correlations.  Field experiments, observed in a natural setting where less controls can be applied, have the advantage of better external validity. The adaption of each type of experiment online faces some hurdles.

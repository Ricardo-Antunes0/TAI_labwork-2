The episode begins with the Ice King revealing his true form to Finn and Jake, who are both terrified. The Ice King then forces them to help him get a new ice cream flavor called "Visa" made by a rival king.  Finn and Jake go about trying to find the ingredients for the flavor, but are constantly thwarted by the king's guards. Eventually, they manage to get the ingredients and return to the Ice King's palace, where they mix the flavor in secret.  The Ice King is impressed and decides to give Finn and Jake each a free "Visa" ice cream in celebration. However, when they try to eat one, they realize that they have all turned into penguins!

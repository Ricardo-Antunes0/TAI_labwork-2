Unstoppable is the upcoming fourth studio album and first posthumous studio album from American singer Aaliyah. It was scheduled to be released in January 2022 through Blackground Records 2.0 and Empire, but didn't come out at that time and a new release date has yet to be announced. The album was preceded by the single "Poison" which features vocals from Canadian singer the Weeknd. The album is the first studio album to be released by Aaliyah since her 2001 death and her third posthumous album in total. Background On August 25, 2021, the 20th anniversary of Aaliyah's death, her uncle and Blackground Records 2.0 label boss, Barry Hankerson, revealed in an interview with Big Tigger for WVEE that a fourth (and likely final) studio album, titled Unstoppable, would be released in "a matter of weeks". The album will feature Drake, Snoop Dogg, Ne-Yo, Chris Brown, Future and use previously unreleased vocals from before Aaliyah's passing. Hankerson shared that this will be the end of new music for the late star and added, "I think it's wonderful. It's a very emotional process to do. It's very difficult to hear her sing when she's not here, but we got through it." Hankerson added in 2022, "She loved Snoop Dogg, who's done a great record in collaboration with Future. Ne-Yo gave us an excellent song; also Drake. Timbaland produced the track that Chris Brown did. It's vintage R&B with strong vocals."

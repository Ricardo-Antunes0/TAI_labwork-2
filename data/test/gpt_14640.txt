Zhelestidae is a lineage of extinct eutherian mammals that lived during the late Oligocene and early Miocene epochs. They were small, nocturnal creatures that were most closely related to the living murid rodents. The family contains only one genus and one species, Zhelestes tatarinovi.  Zhelestidae was first described by Russian paleontologist Semyon Grigoriev in 1892. The only known species is Zhelestes tatarinovi, which was found in the Lower Oligocene of Tatarstan, Russia. The genus is named after the Tatarstan region where the fossils were found.  Zhelestidae was a small eutherian mammal that was most closely related to the living murid rodents. It had a long snout and large eyes. It probably hunted small prey in the dark underworld of forests and steppes. The family is now extinct, but may have been widespread during the late Oligocene and early Miocene epochs.

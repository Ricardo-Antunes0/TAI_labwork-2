Cameosis is the fifth album by the funk/soul band Cameo, released in 1980. It is generally regarded by fans as the band's best album overall. Reception Cameosis reached number one on the R&B album charts and number twenty five on the Billboard 200 album charts. It was certified gold for sales of more than 500,000 copies in the US. The two singles, "We're Goin' Out Tonight" and "Shake Your Pants", charted on the R&B singles charts at number 11 and 8 respectively. However, "Shake Your Pants" received considerable radio play as an album track, and was already a bonafide hit prior to being released as a single. The album's closing track, "Why Have I Lost You", was a new version of the same song that had been released on the band's second album. This re-recorded rendition also received considerable airplay, and has remained a staple of the late night "quiet storm" format at urban adult contemporary radio.

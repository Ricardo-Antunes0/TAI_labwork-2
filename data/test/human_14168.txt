The Southern Sudan Association (SSA) was a London-based organization of southern Sudanese exiles and refugees.  The SSA was founded in 1970 to build support in Europe for humanitarian assistance to southern Sudanese by publicizing the Sudan Government's attacks on its citizens, suffering in southern Sudan, and the epidemics that were rife there.  Brian MacDermot served as the chairman of the SSA.  The Director of the Southern Sudan Association was Enoch Mading de Garang. Advocacy and role in the Addis Ababa Agreement (1972) The Southern Sudan Association (SSA) was an important center of southern Sudanese intellectual and political activity in London throughout the early 1970s. Many exiles who later rose to prominence in southern Sudan during the 1970s and 1980s worked there or volunteered during the evenings.  These included Antiok Athuai Lual Athuai, the "distribution manager" for Grass Curtain  (published by the SSA), and Jacob J. Akol, who served as "secretary treasurer" for the SSA and sat on the editorial board of the Grass Curtain.

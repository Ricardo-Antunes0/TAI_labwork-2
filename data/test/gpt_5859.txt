Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, or CHIP, is a rare blood disorder in which the bone marrow produces indeterminate numbers of abnormal blood cells. These cells can be either myeloid or lymphoid, and may be immature or malignant. The disorder can occur at any age, but is most commonly diagnosed in adults between the ages of 30 and 50. It is unclear why CHIP occurs, but it may be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There is no cure for CHIP, but it can be treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

Oceanview was a U.S. Marine Air Naval Base (Mannafield Air Force Base and later Da Nang Air Base) located in the central highlands of Vietnam, approximately 12 miles (19 km) northwest of the city of Da Nang. The base was closed in 1973.  The base was commissioned in late 1966 as a replacement for the earlier Marine Air Station Tachikawa, which was located on the north coast of Okinawa. The base was initially assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 33 (MAG-33), 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW), but it was reassigned to MAG-24 in 1968.  The base's primary mission was to support U.S. Marine Corps aircraft operations in South Vietnam. It also served as a forward staging area for combat units deploying into South Vietnam. Additionally, the base played an important role in Operation Ranch Hand, the U.S. military's effort to destroy the North Vietnamese Army's Ho Chi Minh Trail supply lines into South Vietnam.  Ocean View served as home to several different types of aircraft, including F-4 Phantoms, A-6 Intruders, F-5 Sky Fighters, CH-53 Sea Stallions, AH-1 Cobras and UH-1 Hueys. Additionally, the base operated several support facilities, including an airfield control tower and an ammunition depot.   The closure of Ocean View came as part of a general reduction in American military presence in South Vietnam following the end of the war in May

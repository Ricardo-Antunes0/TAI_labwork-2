The Piedras Encimadas Valley (Stacked Stones in English) is a series of small valleys and tourist attraction located in the Zacatlán municipality of Puebla in central Mexico. The main feature of the zone is basalt rock formations in capricious forms, created by erosion over millions of years. The valley has been defined as covering anywhere from 100 to 400 hectares, most of which is privately owned land developed for tourism. Location and extension The Valley is located mostly in the Zacatlán municipality in a region of Puebla known as the Sierra Norte de Puebla. However, the city of Zacatlán is about thirty km away, with the closest communities being Camotepec, Teopancingo, Las Lajas, Rancho Nuevo, San Miguel Tenango and Metlaxixtla. Camotepec is on the road that leads to the main entrance of the tourist area and consists only of a few houses, a church and a school. While it has been called such, it is not officially a national park. Its boundaries are not clear with the Valley described as having anywhere from 100 to 400 hectares. It is private land that extends over 300 hectares owned by a group of thirty partners.

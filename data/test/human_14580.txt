Polyphosphazenes include a wide range of hybrid inorganic-organic polymers with a number of different skeletal architectures with the backbone P-N-P-N-P-N-. In nearly all of these materials two organic side groups are attached to each phosphorus center. Linear polymers have the formula (N=PR1R2)n, where R1 and R2 are organic (see graphic). Other architectures are cyclolinear and cyclomatrix polymers in which small phosphazene rings are connected together by organic chain units. Other architectures are available, such as block copolymer, star, dendritic, or comb-type structures. More than 700 different polyphosphazenes are known, with different side groups (R) and different molecular architectures. Many of these polymers were first synthesized and studied in the research group of Harry R. Allcock.  Synthesis The method of synthesis depends on the type of polyphosphazene. The most widely used method for linear polymers is based on a two-step process. In the first step, hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene(NPCl2)3 is heated in a sealed system at 250 °C to convert it to a long chain linear polymer with typically 15,000 or more repeating units. In the second step the chlorine atoms linked to phosphorus in the polymer are replaced by organic groups through reactions with alkoxides, aryloxides, amines or organometallic reagents. Because many different reagents can participate in this macromolecular substitution reaction, and because two or more reagents may be used, a large number of different polymers can be produced.. Variations to this process are possible using poly(dichlorophosphazene) made by condensation reactions.

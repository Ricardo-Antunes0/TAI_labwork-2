Bernard Herbert "Red" Fisher (February 18, 1914 â€“ October 5, 2002) was an American professional golfer who played on the PGA Tour from 1937 to 1966. He was a five-time winner of the U.S. Open, one of only four players to win the event more than once. Fisher also won three Masters Championships (1946, 1954, and 1962), one British Open (1955), and one PGA Championship (1958). He also finished second three times in the U.S. Open behind Gene Sarazen and Sam Snead.  Fisher was born in Dallas, Texas, but moved to Southern California as a child and started playing golf at age nine. He attended Stanford University where he played on the golf team and won three collegiate tournaments. He turned professional in 1937 and joined the PGA Tour. His first major victory came at the U.S. Open in 1946, which he won by four strokes over runner-up Cary Middlecoff. Fisher's record in major championships continued to improve over the next few years, as he won consecutive Masters titles in 1946 and 1947 and claimed his third U.S. Open title in 1951. In 1954, Fisher became only the second player (after Sarazen) to win three consecutive Masters tournaments, and he repeated this feat in 1962. He also won the British Open twice (1955 and 1957), and the PGA Championship in 1958. Fisher's last major championship was the 1965 U.S. Open, which he lost to Arnold

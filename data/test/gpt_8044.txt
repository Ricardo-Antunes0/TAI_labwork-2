The Soo River is a tributary of the St. Lawrence River in southern Ontario, Canada. The river is approximately 276 kilometres long and has a drainage basin of 5,300 square kilometres. The Soo River is the third longest tributary of the St. Lawrence River.  The Soo River originates in the township of North Dumfries, in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, Ontario, and flows southeast into Michigan before entering back into Ontario near the town of Bracebridge. The river merges with the St. Lawrence River at Sault Ste. Marie.  The Soo River has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2003 for its significant archaeological and cultural resources. These resources include sites located along the banks of the river that are associated with the First Nations, such as Ojibway and Cree villages and burial grounds, as well as sites associated with early European exploration and settlement, such as Fort William Henry and Greenbush Manor.

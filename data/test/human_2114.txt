"Hands On" is a song by American recording artist Kanye West, from his ninth studio album, Jesus Is King (2019). The song features gospel singer Fred Hammond, whom West became involved with in 2019. The song received mixed to negative reviews from music critics. Background West's decision to feature Fred Hammond on a track from Jesus Is King was crossover play, due to him recruiting a key insider from gospel to smoothly transition into a new genre for music. Following on from Hammond feeling positively after seeing his track "This Is the Day" looped by West from an Instagram post sent to him by a friend in 2019, the two met through Kirk Franklin at Chance the Rapper's wedding. West explained that he was introduced to Hammond's music through a friend and offered him a collaboration, which Hammond accepted. In the summer of 2019, the two of them engaged in a phone call discussing taking their collaboration further, with Hammond stating of West at the time that he "knew a lot of the Christian world would not embrace him" and was aware of this due to when Snoop Dogg "got a lot of flak" for his collaboration with Hammond on the former's gospel album Bible of Love (2018). In reference to backlash from working West, Hammond stated: "If they don't sing gospel exclusively, then you are trying to cross over, youâ€™re a hypocrite, God don't love you no more," though he praised West against any doubters and also took no issue with West's support of US president Donald Trump.

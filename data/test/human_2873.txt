SES-14 is a geostationary communications satellite operated by SES S.A. at 47.5Â° West, replaces NSS-806, and designed and manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space. The satellite launched on 25 January 2018 at 22:20 UTC along with the Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) instrument from NASA. It has a mass of  and has a design life of at least 15 years. Launch  The launch of SES-14 by an Ariane 5 ECA VA241 suffered an anomaly that resulted in a higher inclination than planned but later recovered. On 25 January 2018 were launched SES-14 and Al Yah 3 satellites. About 9 minutes and 28 seconds after launch, a telemetry loss occurred between the launch vehicle and the ground controllers. It was later confirmed, about 1 hour and 20 minutes after launch, that both satellites were successfully separated from the upper stage and were in contact with their respective ground controllers, but that their orbital inclinations were incorrect as the guidance systems might have been compromised. Therefore, both satellites conducted orbital procedures, extending commissioning time.

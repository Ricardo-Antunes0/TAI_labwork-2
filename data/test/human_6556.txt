Heavy bombers are bomber aircraft capable of delivering the largest payload of air-to-ground weaponry (usually bombs) and longest range (takeoff to landing) of their era. Archetypal heavy bombers have therefore usually been among the largest and most powerful military aircraft at any point in time. In the second half of the 20th century, heavy bombers were largely superseded by strategic bombers, which were often smaller in size, but had much longer ranges and were capable of delivering nuclear bombs. Because of advances in aircraft design and engineering — especially in powerplants and aerodynamics — the size of payloads carried by heavy bombers has increased at rates greater than increases in the size of their airframes. The largest bombers of World War I, the four engine aircraft built by the Sikorsky company in the Soviet Union (now Russia ）, could carry a payload of up to  of bombs. By the middle of World War II even a single-engine fighter-bomber could carry a   bomb load, and such aircraft were taking over from area bombers and medium bombers in the strategic bombing role. Advancements in four-engine aircraft design enabled heavy bombers to carry even larger payloads to targets thousands of kilometres away. For instance, the Avro Lancaster (introduced in 1942) routinely delivered payloads of  (and sometimes up to ) and had a range of .  The B-29 (1944) delivered payloads in excess of  and had a range of . By the late 1950s, the jet-powered Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, travelling at speeds of up to  (such as more than double that of a Lancaster), could deliver a payload of , over a combat radius of .

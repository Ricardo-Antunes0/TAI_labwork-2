The Douro rises in the Minho Province, in the northernmost part of the country, and flows southward through Porto, where it is met by the Tua River. The Douro then flows through Vila Real, Braga and Porto again before emptying into the Atlantic Ocean at Matosinhos.  The Douro Valley is one of the most important wine-growing regions in Portugal, with over forty wineries. The valley is also home to a variety of other agricultural products, such as cereals, tobacco and fruit.

The Douglas O-2 was a 1920s American two-seat passenger monoplane. It was designed by Lawrence H. Douglas and built by the Douglas Aircraft Company.  The Douglas O-2 was a two-seat, single-engine, high-wing monoplane that was intended as a trainer aircraft. It was one of the first American aircraft to be designed from the ground up as a trainer, and its innovative construction methods, including a cantilever low wing and twin tails, made it one of the most popular training aircraft of its era. The O-2 served with the military and civil operators throughout the world for over 30 years.  In 1934, Douglas introduced the O-3, which was a more powerful version of the O-2. The O-3 remained in production until 1943.

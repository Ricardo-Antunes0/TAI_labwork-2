Operation Gladio is the codename for clandestine Italian state terror operations conducted by the CIA and other Western intelligence agencies during the Cold War.  The name Gladio refers to a swordfish, the national fish of Italy. The purpose of Operation Gladio was to create a terrorist threat against the Soviet Union by using right-wing extremists and other paramilitary forces to destabilize Soviet-controlled territories in Europe.  Gladio activities were also used to discredit left-wing organizations and movements, and to justify the increased investment in the defense sector. The existence of Gladio was publicly revealed only in 1992.

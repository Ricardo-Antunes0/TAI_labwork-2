The shell is ovate-conic, with a rather acute smooth shoulder and a broadly rounded base. The color is light buff, with only a few faint longitudinal stripes. The spire is elevated, and the whorls are slightly rounded. The protoconch is small, smooth and consists of one whorl. The teleoconch contains five whorls, the first of which is slightly smaller than the subsequent ones. The suture is distinctively angled. The aperture is ovate and oblique. The columella has a slight nodule on its base.  This species occurs off South Africa and Mozambique at depths between 0 and 30 m.

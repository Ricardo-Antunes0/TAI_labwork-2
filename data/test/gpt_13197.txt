Ambrosius or Ambrosios (a Latin adjective derived from the Greek ἀμβρόσιος "ambrosios", meaning "immortal") was a bishop of Milan who is venerated as a saint by the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. He is considered the first saint of pharmacy.  Ambrosius was born in the late 4th century AD to a noble family in Milan, Lombardy. At the age of twenty-four, he entered the clergy and became a hermit on the Mount Sabina. There he gave away all his possessions to charity and devoted himself to prayer and fasting.  In 397 Ambrosius was elected bishop of Milan and began to reform the local Church. He abolished human sacrifices, made converts from paganism, and restored monasteries that had been destroyed during the reign of Emperor Theodosius I. He also founded several hospitals.  In 426 Ambrosius was called to Constantinople to become bishop of that city. However, he died before he could leave Milan. He was buried in the church he had founded on Mount Sabina.   Ambrosius is recognized as a saint by the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, and his feast day is February 3.

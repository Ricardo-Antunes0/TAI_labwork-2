Whiggism (in North America sometimes spelled Whigism) is a term used in United States political discourse to describe the view that the American Revolution was a successful, morally justified, and necessary revolution.  The term is often used pejoratively to refer to supporters of the Revolution who believe that it was a necessary step in establishing the United States as a democratic republic.

Enhanced publications or enhanced ebooks are a type of electronic publication that combines the features of a book and an electronic document. Enhanced ebooks may include multimedia elements, such as videos, audio recordings, and interactive graphics. They may also include tools that allow readers to interact with the text, such as search engines and hyperlinks.  Enhanced ebooks can be classified according to the type of enhanced content they contain. Some examples are multimedia enhanced ebooks (MEEs), interactive enhanced ebooks (IEBs), and hypertext enhanced ebooks (HTEBs). MEEs contain multimedia elements, such as videos, audio recordings, and interactive graphics. IEBs contain interactive features, such as hyperlinks that allow readers to interact with the text. HTEBs contain hypertext features, such as links that take readers to other parts of the book or the internet.  Enhanced ebooks have several advantages over traditional books. They can be read on devices that are not equipped with a printing press, such as tablets and smartphones. They can be distributed electronically, without the need for physical copies. They can be updated continually, without the need for revision or reprinting.  Despite these advantages, enhanced ebooks still have some disadvantages. They are more expensive to produce than traditional books. They may require more storage space than traditional books. They may not be suitable for all audiences.

In computational geometry, an alpha shape, or α-shape, is a family of piecewise linear simple curves in the Euclidean plane associated with the shape of a finite set of points.  They were first defined by .  The alpha-shape associated with a set of points is a generalization of the concept of the convex hull, i.e. every convex hull is an alpha-shape but not every alpha shape is a convex hull. Characterization  For each real number α, define the concept of a generalized disk of radius 1/α as follows:  If α = 0, it is a closed half-plane;  If α > 0, it is a closed disk of radius 1/α;  If α < 0, it is the closure of the complement of a disk of radius −1/α. Then an edge of the alpha-shape is drawn between two members of the finite point set whenever there exists a generalized disk of radius 1/α containing none of the point set and which has the property that the two points lie on its boundary.

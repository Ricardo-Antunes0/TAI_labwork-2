Dr. Mohammad Reza Madhi (; died 8 January 2003) was an Iranian physician and academic who served as the ninth Prime Minister of Iran from 1981 to 1989.  Madhi was born in Tehran on 8 January 1923, to a Shiite family. He earned his medical degree from the University of Tehran in 1950, and later obtained a Ph.D. in neurosurgery from the University of Pennsylvania in 1958.   Madhi began his career as a neurosurgeon at the Farabi Hospital in Tehran. He served as the head of neurosurgery at the hospital from 1958 to 1966, and then became the head of its department of neurosurgery. From 1969 to 1979, he was the chancellor of Iran's Medical Sciences University.  Madhi entered politics in 1979, when he was appointed Minister of Health and Medical Education by President Abolhassan Banisadr. He served in that position until 1981, when he was elected Prime Minister of Iran by the Iranian National Congress. Madhi led a coalition government that included both conservative and reformist factions. During his time as Prime Minister, Madhi initiated several social and economic reforms, which led to increased economic growth in Iran and improved living standards for many Iranians.   Madhi resigned from office in 1989 after being accused of corruption by the Iranian government. He later died in 2003 at the age of 78.

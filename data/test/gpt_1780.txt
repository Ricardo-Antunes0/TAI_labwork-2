Maintenance respiration (or maintenance energy) refers to the amount of energy an organism expends to stay alive and functioning. This includes the energy an organism consumes to maintain its body temperature, to prevent dehydration, and to respire.  The maintenance respiration of an average human is around 12-15 watts (W). This corresponds to the amount of energy an average person expends during a 60 minute walk at a pace of 3 miles per hour. The amount of energy an organism expends varies based on the size, age, and activity level of the individual.   In general, the more active an organism is, the more energy it will need to maintain itself. For example, a person who is running will expend more energy than a person who is walking. Similarly, a person who is very young or very old will need more energy to keep them alive than a person who is in their middle years.   Organisms that are active during the day will need more energy to stay alive than organisms that are active at night. Additionally, organisms that are cold will need more energy to maintain their body temperature than organisms that are warm.   The amount of energy an organism expends to maintain its body temperature can be significant. For example, a human will expend around 10-15 watts (W) to keep their body temperature between 98-102 degrees Fahrenheit (37-39 degrees Celsius).   The main purpose of maintenance respiration is to provide the necessary energy needed for an organism to survive and function.

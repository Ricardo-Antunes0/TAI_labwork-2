Edwin Epps House is a Creole cottage built in 1852 in part by Solomon Northup on Bayou Boeuf near Holmesville in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana. It was built for Edwin Epps, a slaveholder. The house was a "double-sided, wood frame house with one chimney, and a tin roof" of mid-sized farmers. The Edwin Epps Plantation Site, where the house originally stood, is located off of LA 1176 on Carl Hunt Road. It is one of the historic sites of Solomon Northup's enslavement on the Northup Trail. Solomon Northup The house figures in the life of Solomon Northup who built the house and where Epps is reported to have learned that Northup, who he had owned for ten years, was a free man. A team, including Sue Eakin, a history professor at Louisiana State University-Alexandria, researched Northup's book Twelve Years A Slave for accuracy and published a new version of the book in the 1960s. As part of the research, she found the house that Northup built, the Edwin Epps House. Over 150 years, the storms and time had decayed the original house.

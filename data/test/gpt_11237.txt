Smoketown is a neighborhood one mile (1.6Â km) west of downtown Louisville, Kentucky, United States. The neighborhood is bounded by Vine Street to the south, Watterson Avenue to the west, Muhammad Ali Boulevard to the north and Boyle Avenue to the east.  Smoketown was originally home to tobacco farmers and workers in the tobacco processing industry. It was also a red-light district in the early 20th century. In the late 20th century and early 21st century, Smoketown has been gentrified and is now a popular residential neighborhood. It is home to the Louisville Palace Theatre, one of the oldest theaters in Kentucky.

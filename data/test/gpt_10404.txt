Serafín Estébanez Calderón (27 December 1799 – 14 December 1851) was a Spanish general, statesman, and writer.    Born in Madrid, Calderón entered the army in 1815 and fought in the Napoleonic Wars. After the Bourbon Restoration of 1820 he was made a captain and served in various administrative posts. In 1833 he became secretary of war, serving until 1835. He then served as inspector of infantry and cavalry until 1840, when he was appointed minister of the interior. In this position he drafted the new Constitution of 1839. He resigned in 1841 after a dispute with the king over military appointments.    Calderón wrote historiography, political tracts, articles on law, and poetry. He also published a pioneering study on the Spanish language (1836). He died in Madrid at the age of 59.

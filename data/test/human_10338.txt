"Xianü"  is a short story by Pu Songling first published in Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio. The story follows the eponymous swordswoman, who rescues her neighbour from a fox spirit, before bearing him a son and avenging her father's death. Likely inspired by early Chinese literature featuring heroines known as nüxia, the story has received adaptations in popular media, for instance in the wuxia film A Touch of Zen (1971). Plot A Jinling-based scholar (referred to only by surname Gu) who lives with his mother takes interest in his new neighbours, a mysterious young lady and her elderly mother; however, the lady rebuffs his initial attempts at becoming friends. Afterwards, Gu encounters a handsome stranger who soon becomes his homosexual lover. Meanwhile, the lady begins to come over to Gu's residence more frequently to help his mother with chores; the relations between the two households improve, with Gu even having sexual intercourse with the lady on one occasion. For the most part, however, she remains aloof towards Gu as well as his homosexual lover.

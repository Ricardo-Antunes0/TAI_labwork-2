Sangili  is a 1982 Indian Tamil-language film directed by K. Balachander and produced by M. G. Ramachandran. The film stars Kamal Haasan and Sarika in the lead roles with a supporting cast including Suresh, Jaishankar, P. C. Sarathkumar and M. N. Nambiar.  The story concerns the love between a Brahmin man, played by Kamal Haasan, and a lower-caste woman, played by Sarika. The film was shot in the rural areas of Tamil Nadu and was Balachander's first major production after he left the Malayalam film industry to work in Tamil cinema. The soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja.  The film was well received by critics, with Kamal Haasan's performance being singled out as his best ever. However, it was not a commercial success and has since been considered a cult favourite.

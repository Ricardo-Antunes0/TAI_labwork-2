Mulve, previously known as 'Search', was a secret intelligence service in the United Kingdom that operated between 1984 and 1991. It was set up as a result of the recommendations of the Hughes-Smith Commission, which was appointed in 1983 to examine the intelligence services and their role in the defence of the United Kingdom.  Mulve was jointly staffed by MI5 and the Special Air Service (SAS), with a combined strength of around 150 officers and agents. Its primary role was to provide foreign intelligence on the activities of Soviet bloc countries and their allies, as well as to provide support to MI5's counter-terrorism operations.  Mulve was closed down in 1991 following allegations of financial irregularities. The service is currently being investigated by the National Crime Agency.

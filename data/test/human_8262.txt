Albert Wayne "Boots" Hollingsworth  (February 25, 1908 â€“ April 28, 1996) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher with the Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies, Brooklyn Dodgers, Washington Senators, St. Louis Browns and the Chicago White Sox between 1935 and 1946. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Hollingsworth batted and threw left-handed. He was listed as  tall and . Hollingsworth earned his nickname when, as a first baseman early in his career, he made an error in the field. He became a full-time pitcher during the 1933 season, his sixth in pro ball. Hollingsworth was a member of the 1944 Browns, the only St. Louis-based team to win an American League pennant. Ironically, 1944 was Hollingsworth's worst regular season among the four full years he spent as a Brown; he won only five of 12 decisions, posted a poor 4.47 earned run average, and surrendered 108 hits and 37 bases on balls in 92 innings pitched, with only 22 strikeouts. He appeared in Game 4 of the "All-St. Louis" 1944 World Series, allowing one run in four innings pitched in relief of starting pitcher Sig Jakucki. He had two stellar seasons for the Browns, however, in 1942 and 1945, each time compiling winning records with an ERA of under 3.00.

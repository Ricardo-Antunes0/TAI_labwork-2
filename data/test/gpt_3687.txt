We Work Again is a 1937 ephemeral work by the French artist Jean Dubuffet. It consists of a series of 1,000 plaster casts of human feet, each measuring 105 cm Ã— 105 cm.  The work is an investigation into the relationship between man and his environment, and was inspired by Dubuffet's observation that the feet of factory workers are constantly exposed to dangerous chemicals.  We Work Again was first exhibited in 1937 at the Galerie Marcel Duchamp in Paris and has since been exhibited at museums around the world.

Hellfire Club was a name for several secret gentlemen's clubs that were founded in the 18th century. They were associated with Freemasonry and Satanism, and their members were known for their debauched lifestyles and frequent use of violence.  The Hellfire Club was first established in London in 1730 by a group of wealthy men who were interested in Satanism and Freemasonry. Membership was restricted to wealthy aristocrats and politicians, and the club's meetings were held in secret.  The Hellfire Club became notorious for its wild parties and its members' fondness for violence. In 1738, two of the club's members, John Wilkes and Samuel Johnson, fought a duel at the club's grounds. The club was closed down in 1742 after a series of scandals involving members' involvement in murder and treason.

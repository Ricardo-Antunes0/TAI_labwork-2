Re-evaluation Counseling (RC) is a peer-based counseling intervention that helps individuals evaluate their life goals and identify changes they need to make to achieve them. RC has been shown to be effective in helping individuals improve their quality of life, mental health, and self-esteem.  RC is a relatively new form of counseling that was developed in the 1990s. It is based on the theory that individuals can improve their lives by re-evaluating their goals and identifying changes they need to make to achieve them. RC is a peer-based counseling intervention, which means that it is delivered by people who know and understand the individual being counseled. This helps to create a more interactive and supportive environment for the individual being counseled.  RC has been shown to be effective in helping individuals improve their quality of life, mental health, and self-esteem. The intervention is particularly beneficial for individuals who are struggling with difficulty achieving their goals or who feel lost or stuck in their life. RC has also been shown to be particularly effective when used in combination with other forms of counseling, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychodynamic therapy (PDT).

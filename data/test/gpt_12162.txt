Charles Eryl Wynn-Williams (5 March 1903 â€“ 3 January 1984) was a Welsh clergyman and theologian who served as the Bishop of Bangor from 1954 to 1978.  Wynn-Williams was born in 1903 in the town of Llandovery, Carmarthenshire, Wales. He studied theology at the University of Oxford, and was ordained in 1930. He served as a curate in the Diocese of Bangor before being appointed its bishop in 1954. Wynn-Williams was a strong advocate for the Church of Wales' independence from England, and helped to lead the church during its time as a self-governing nation within the United Kingdom. He retired from his bishopric in 1978, and died three years later at the age of 78.

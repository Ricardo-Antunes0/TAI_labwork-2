The Spaso-Prilutsky Monastery  is a fortified monastery in northeastern Bulgaria. It is located in the Spaso-Prilutsky National Park, about 10 km northeast of the town of Spas and about 2 km east of the Borovets peak.  The monastery was founded in 1084 by Stoudios Prilutsky, a Bulgarian prince and member of the First Bulgarian Empire's ruling dynasty. It was initially a small fortress, but it gradually grew in size and importance over the course of its history. It became one of the main centers of learning in northeastern Bulgaria, and its monks played an important role in the development of Bulgaria's religious and cultural heritage.  The monastery was destroyed by the Ottoman Turks in 1430, but it was rebuilt in its current form shortly thereafter. It remained a major center of learning until the early 19th century, when it began to decline due to the spread of education outside of the monastery walls. The Spaso-Prilutsky Monastery is now a tourist attraction and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

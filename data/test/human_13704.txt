James Charles Phillips (born March 9, 1933) is an American physicist and a member of the National Academy of Science (1978).  Phillips invented the exact theory of the ionicity of chemical bonding in semiconductors, as well as new theories of compacted networks (including glasses, high temperature superconductors, and proteins). Biography  Phillips was born in New Orleans and grew up in several Western states (Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico).  After graduating from Albuquerque HS in 1950, he went to the University of Chicago, where he received M.S. in both mathematics and physics.  He was the grader in Enrico Fermiâ€™s last course (1955).  He studied with Morrel H. Cohen, with a Ph.D. thesis on algebraic topology (1956).  He joined the Theoretical Physics group at Bell Laboratories, newly formed and under the leadership of Conyers Herring (1956-1958).  Following a suggestion by Herring, Phillips invented a simplified (PseudoPotential, PP) theory of the electronic structure of semiconductors, and produced the first electronic structures of Silicon and Germanium semiconductors in good agreement with known properties (1958).

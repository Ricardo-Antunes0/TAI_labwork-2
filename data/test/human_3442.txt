The Avoca Homestead Complex is a heritage-listed former station homestead and station facilities and now catered accommodation and visitor attraction at 1122a Low Darling Road, Wentworth, in the Wentworth Shire, New South Wales, Australia. It was built between 1871 and 1879. It is also known as the Avoca Station Homestead and outbuildings. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 8 April 2016. History  There is an extensive and rich archaeological heritage that documents Aboriginal occupation of the lower Darling and Murray River areas. The earliest dates for Aboriginal occupation in the local region date back some 45,000 years, and there are numerous locations along the Murray and Darling Rivers that contain evidence of Aboriginal occupation from around 20,000 years ago up to the present. In 1829 the Government of New South Wales dispatched an exploratory party to trace the Murrumbidgee River under the leadership of Charles Sturt. Sturt, the first European to venture into the Murray - Darling region, followed the Murrumbidgee to its junction with a larger stream, then followed this larger stream (the Murray River) to its junction with the Darling River. Sturt encountered large numbers of Aboriginal people near the Murray/Darling junction, but his expedition featured generally peaceful, though wary, meetings and interactions. Subsequent expeditions, like that led by Major Thomas Mitchell in 1836, were marred by violence. In 1836 Mitchell commenced his 3rd expedition into the interior of Australia with the aim of completing a survey of the Darling River. Between Euston and Mildura, at a location now known as Mt Dispersion, the exploratory group were followed by a group of up to 180 Aborigines. Mitchell organised an ambush and at least seven Aborigines were killed, and 70 or 80 shots fired.

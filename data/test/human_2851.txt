Tony Marvin (October 5, 1912 â€“ October 10, 1998) was an American radio and television announcer.  He became a staff announcer for CBS, and later became most known as the long-time announcer for Arthur Godfrey. Early life Marvin was born on October 5, 1912.  A graduate of Erasmus Hall High School,   he nearly became a doctor, graduating from St. John's University and attending the Long Island College of Medicine for two years. However, the Great Depression intervened, and he had to drop out to help to support his family. Marvin's obituary in the New York Times noted that "his big break" came during the latter job. It said, "As he serviced a limousine, the owner heard him singing and offered to pay for a vocal teacher for him The result was a scholarship for a year's study with an MGM voice coach." From that training, Marvin performed with the New York Operatic Guild and in some theatrical light comedies.

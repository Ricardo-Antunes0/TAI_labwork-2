Mary Florence Wells Slater (October 16, 1864 â€“ October 1, 1937) was an American labor organizer, suffragist, and civil rights activist. She was best known for her work as the president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) from 1915 to 1937.  Slater was born in Corning, New York, the daughter of a carpenter. She began working as a mill girl at age 12 and later worked in the textile industry. In 1887, she married James Slater and moved to Detroit, Michigan. There she became active in the labor movement and helped lead a strike of garment workers.  In 1915, Slater became president of NAWSA, a position she held until her death in 1937. During her tenure, NAWSA succeeded in securing the passage of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which granted women the right to vote. Slater also played a role in other women's rights campaigns, such as the effort to end child labor. She was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1934 for her work with NAWSA.

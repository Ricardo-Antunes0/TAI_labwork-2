Fruit pit carving (Chinese: 核雕; pinyin: hédiāo) is a Chinese folk handicraft in which the pits of peach, apricot, walnut, Chinese olive, yumberry and other drupes are used to create minute patterns of the Buddha, nature, or the Chinese zodiac that are said to repel evil spirits. The carved pits are also used to create jewelry and decorations. However, the art is now facing extinction because few black olive trees are planted in China and there are very few people interested in learning this art.  Olive core carving has recently been recognized as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Guangdong Province of China. History Fruit pit carving began in the Spring and Autumn Period (BC. 770- BC. 476), and the earliest example of the art dates from the Song Dynasty (960-1279), roughly 1000 years ago. However, it did not become popular until the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). At that time, even the emperor owned master carvings used as aristocratic decoration. Fruit pit carving became even more popular in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), but after the First and Second Opium Wars its popularity began to decline.

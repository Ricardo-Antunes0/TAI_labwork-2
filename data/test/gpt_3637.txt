The Huon Peninsula campaign was a series of battles fought on the Huon Peninsula, New Guinea during World War II. The campaign began on 18 September 1944 and ended on 15 November 1944. The Allies were ultimately victorious, and the peninsula was secured by the end of the campaign.  The Huon Peninsula campaign was fought by Australian and United States forces against the Japanese. The Allies had hoped to secure the peninsula before advancing further into New Guinea, but the Japanese resistance was fierce. The campaign took place in an environment of tropical rainforest and extensive swampland, which made movement difficult and provided cover for the enemy. The fighting was also hampered by a lack of air support and supplies, which caused numerous casualties among the Allied forces.  The Allies eventually achieved victory in the campaign, and secured the peninsula for use as a forward base for operations against the Japanese in New Guinea. The campaign also demonstrated the importance of air power in modern warfare, and marked a turning point in the Pacific War.

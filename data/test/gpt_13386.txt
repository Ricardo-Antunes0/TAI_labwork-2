In fluid dynamics, disk loading or disc loading is a loading process in which a rotating disk, wheel or drum is used to distribute load uniformly over the surface of a fluid element.  Disk loading is often used when the element to be loaded is too large or too irregular to be handled by other forms of loading, such as torsion or shear. It is also used when the element must be handled in a controlled manner, so that the shape and dimensions of the element are not changed.

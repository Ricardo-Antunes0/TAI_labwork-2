Ero Fernández (died  926) was a Visigothic nobleman and military leader. He was the son of Theudemar I, King of the Visigoths, and his wife Rodelinda.  Ero was a valiant and successful general, who is best known for his victory over the Muslims at the Battle of Vouillé in 923. His success made him a powerful figure in Visigothic politics, and he became regent for his father in 924. However, Ero's authority was challenged by other members of the royal family, and he was forced to flee to France in 926. There, he died a year later.

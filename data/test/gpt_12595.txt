In real estate, a condominium conversion or condo conversion is the process of transforming an apartment or single-family house into a condominium. The conversion may be accomplished by adding on extra floors, through the use of an attic, or by converting a portion of the house into a condominium.  Condominium conversions can offer homeowners the benefits of owning a property in which they share ownership with others, such as reduced maintenance costs, and increased security in the event of a fire or robbery. Additionally, many condominium conversions offer additional amenities, such as pools and clubhouses, which may not be available in traditional single-family housing.

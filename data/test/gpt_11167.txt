Joseph Albert "Bert" McClure (April 3, 1881 â€“ October 23, 1948), was an American astronomer and astrophysicist.  McClure was born in 1881 in Chicago, Illinois, the son of astronomer and mathematician Joseph Albert McClure and his wife Emma. He attended the University of Chicago, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1903. McClure then attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received his doctoral degree in 1912.  After completing his doctorate, McClure served as an instructor at MIT until 1914. He then served as an astronomer at the Mount Wilson Observatory until 1938, when he became a professor at Yale University. McClure died in 1948.  McClure made significant contributions to astrophysics and celestial mechanics. His work on stellar structure and dynamics helped to elucidate the mechanism by which stars evolve and die. He also developed theories on the distribution of interstellar gas and dust in the Milky Way Galaxy, and on the origins and evolution of galaxies. McClure's work has been cited by scientists worldwide.  In 1927, McClure was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his "discoveries concerning the distribution of interstellar gas and dust and their effect on stellar equilibrium." He was also awarded the National Medal of Science in 1931 and the Franklin Institute's Benjamin Franklin Medal in 1937.

Ida Smedley Maclean (born Ida Smedley 14 October 1865- died 10 July 1948) was a Scottish social reformer, and founder of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (N.U.W.S.).  Ida Maclean was born in Glasgow on 14 October 1865, the eldest of six children of Daniel Maclean, a master weaver, and his wife Margaret. She attended the local public school and then the Glasgow School of Art where she studied drawing and painting.  Maclean became involved in social reform work early on in her career. In 1889 she became secretary of the Glasgow branch of the National Society for Women's Suffrage, and in 1892 she co-founded the Scottish Women's Social and Political Union (SWSPU), which became the country's first feminist organisation.  In 1895 Maclean helped to organise the first women's suffrage march in Scotland, which attracted more than 2,000 women from across the country. The following year she helped to found the N.U.W.S., which became one of the leading organisations campaigning for women's suffrage in Britain. In 1918 she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by Glasgow University for her work in promoting women's rights.  Maclean retired from her position with the N.U.W.S. in 1934, but continued to campaign for social justice until her death ten years later at the age of 84.

Brigadier Austin Claude Girdwood  (24 April 1888 â€“ 26 October 1944) was a British World War I flying ace credited with eight aerial victories. He also served in the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force during World War II, reaching the rank of air commodore.  Girdwood was born in London on 24 April 1888, the son of an English father and an American mother. When he was four years old, his family moved to the United States, settling in Texas. After attending college in Texas and working as a newspaper reporter, Girdwood enlisted in the Army on 11 May 1912, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the infantry on 14 June 1912.  Girdwood served with the 1st Infantry Division in France during World War I. He scored his first victory on 8 May 1915, when he drove down a German observation balloon near Verdun. He went on to score six more victories by 10 July 1915; these wins made him an ace. His final victory came on 18 September 1915.  After the war, Girdwood returned to the United States and was discharged from the Army on 30 November 1919. He then resumed his career as a newspaper reporter, but resigned from his job in 1923 to join the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). He was granted a pilot's certificate No. 8046 on 15 May 1925 and began training to become a pilot officer.

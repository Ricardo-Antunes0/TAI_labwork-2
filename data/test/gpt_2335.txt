Blà Bheinn  (also known as Blaven), is a mountain in the Highlands of Scotland. With an elevation of 1,821 metres (6,248 feet), it is the ninth highest mountain in Scotland.  The mountain is located on the eastern edge of Glen Coe, within the Glencoe National Park. The neighbouring mountains include Beinn Eighe to the north, Beinn Dearg to the west, and Beinn Choinnich to the south. The mountain is also close to several other peaks including Beinn Tarsuillt (1,831m/6,362ft), Beinn Allt-a-Bhliain (1,880m/6,566ft), and Beinn Na h-Eilbe (2,097m/6,879ft).  The name Blà Bheinn means "the black peak" in Scottish Gaelic. This is likely due to its distinctive black granite cap. The mountain is also known as Sgurr na Banachtaich (the peak of the goats) due to a group of five peaks situated around its base that resemble a herd of goats.

Suckapunch Records is an independent record label based in Lincoln, Nebraska, US. The label was operated from around 2002 to 2004 by a group of friends from Lincoln, Omaha, and Grand Island, Nebraska. The label's original roster comprised four Nebraska bands - Settle for Less, The JV All*stars, Same Old Crap, and Fourth Time Around - but grew to work with bands across the United States. What began as an attempt by four bands of mutual friends to work together and pool money evolved into a small non-profit record label with the goal of promoting Midwest bands. Initially, they pooled entrance money collected at a number of label set-up shows, and this was set aside as a record pressing fund usable by any band on the label. The first release by Suckapunch Records was "The Everbimes" by Mr. 1986, an instrumental indie group from Lincoln and friends of the bands that established the label.

The  (;  Charters of Sobrarbe) were a series of charters granted by the Crown of Aragon to the monastery of Santa María de Sobrarbe in 1274. The fueros were later extended to other monasteries in the Crown of Aragon, such as San Juan de la Peña and San Salvador de Monesterio.   The fueros of Sobrarbe were the first set of special privileges granted by the Crown to a religious institution, and they were followed by similar privileges granted to other monasteries over the course of the Middle Ages. The fueros of Sobrarbe allowed the monks of Sobrarbe to govern themselves autonomously, with their own courts and institutions. They also had exclusive rights to fisheries, forests, and other resources within their territory.

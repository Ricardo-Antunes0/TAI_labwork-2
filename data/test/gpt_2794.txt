Free School Lane is a historic street in the center of the city of Burlington, Vermont. It runs from Main Street to Church Street and is lined with Federal, Greek Revival, and Italianate style homes.  The street was laid out in the early 1800s by a group of businessmen who were looking for a place to build a school. The street was named after a school on the same street in Boston, which had been founded by Samuel Adams. The first school on the street was built in 1825. Today, the street is home to a variety of businesses and organizations, including the Vermont Historical Society, the Burlington Free Library, and the Burlington Girls' Club.

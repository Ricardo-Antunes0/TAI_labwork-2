Jean-Baptiste Malter (6 November 1701 â€“ 1746) was a Swiss painter and printmaker. He was born in Lausanne, and died in Paris.  Malter was the son of the art dealer Jean Malter. He studied under his father, then moved to Italy, where he worked with Antonio Balestra and Lazzaro Baldi. In 1730 he moved to Paris, where he became a member of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. His early paintings are characterised by their Baroque features, but he later developed a more Rococo style. He is best known for his paintings of religious subjects, especially "The Coronation of the Virgin" (1735) and "The Adoration of the Magi" (1743).

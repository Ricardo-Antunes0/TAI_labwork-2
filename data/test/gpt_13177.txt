As well as simply referring to any room in a parliament or legislature where committees are held, the term may also be used specifically for certain types of committees: standing committees, select committees, and joint committees.     Committees are an important part of the legislative process in democracies, and their work can have a significant impact on public policy. They can investigate matters of public importance and make recommendations to the full parliament or legislature. Committees can also hold public hearings, which can be important sources of information for the public.  Most committees have a specific focus, such as finance, health, or justice. Standing committees usually have more than 10 members and are responsible for overseeing specific policy areas while select committees have fewer members and are focused on specific issues. Joint committees are special kinds of committees that have members from both the House of Commons and the Senate.

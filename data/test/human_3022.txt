The Saxony Mill was a historic textile mill complex at 66 West Street in Rockville section of Vernon, Connecticut.  With a construction history dating to 1836, it was one of the oldest surviving wood-frame textile mills in the state prior to a 1994 fire which led to its demolition.  The mill complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Saxony Mill complex stood at the western end of Rockville's industrial area, occupying the lowest water privilege in the town on the Hockanum River.  It was located at the western end of West Main Street, at its junction with West Street.  The site is now a public park.  The mill consisted of seven connected structures, most of brick and masonry, built between 1836 and the 1970s.  The main (original) mill building was a -story wood-frame structure with a distinctive five-story bell tower rising from the center of its front facade.  The remaining structures, all built with load-bearing masonry walls, were added after c. 1870.

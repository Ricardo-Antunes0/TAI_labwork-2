IMAGE (Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration, Explorer, Geoscientist, Gamma-Ray and Electromagnetic Explorer) was a NASA spacecraft, launched on July 20, 2003, to study the magnetopause. The spacecraft was decommissioned on December 28, 2016.  IMAGE was the first mission in a series of three dedicated to studying the magnetopause. IMAGE's goal was to map the structure and dynamics of the plasma sheet, which is a layer of the Earth's atmosphere that flows around the planet at over 500 km/h (300 mph). The spacecraft also studied emissions from the Sun and Earth's atmosphere.  IMAGE completed more than 269,000 orbits of Earth and spent over 7,300 days in space. The spacecraft collected more than 10 terabytes of data during its seven-year mission.

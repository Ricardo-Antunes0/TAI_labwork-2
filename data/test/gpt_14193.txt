Jubilee Road is the third studio album by English rock band The Who, released in 1977.  The album was recorded at Record Plant in Sausalito, California, and produced by the band with assistance from Roy Thomas Baker. It was the first Who album to be recorded digitally, and its sound has been described as "harder edged" than their previous work.  Although it did not match the commercial success of their earlier albums, "Jubilee Road" has been cited as one of the band's strongest recordings. It has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).  "Jubilee Road" was written and composed over a period of two years, with the majority of its material written by guitarist Pete Townshend. It is an ambitious album, with its eleven tracks ranging in length from three to sixteen minutes. The lyrics explore a wide range of themes, including religion, war, and social injustice.  The album was first released in 1977 to mixed reviews. However, it has since been regarded as one of the band's finest works, and has been cited as an influence by numerous modern rock bands. "Jubilee Road" was reissued in 2002 with bonus tracks and revised liner notes; it has since been certified double platinum by the RIAA.

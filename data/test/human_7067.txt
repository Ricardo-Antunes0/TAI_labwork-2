Rockefeller estate, Kykuit. Growing up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, Parsons's father, Lorenzo Locklair Parsons, was an electrical technician and his mother, Isabelle (n√©e Judd) was a homemaker.  He skipped a grade in elementary school and another in high school.  He later attended the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where at 6'4" tall he may have played varsity basketball.  After four years, he was seven credits short of his diploma.  However, he discovered that he could get into a law school in New York without a college degree if he scored well enough on his pre-law exams.  Parsons was accepted by Albany Law School of Union University, New York, where he earned a Juris Doctor in 1971, finishing at the top of his class.

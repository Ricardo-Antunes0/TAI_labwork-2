Nvidia's High-Definition Digital Processing (HDVP) is a video processing unit (GPU) introduced in 2009 and used in certain Nvidia graphics cards. It is based on the same G80 architecture as the GeForce 8800 and GeForce 8800 GTS/GTX, but with a few key enhancements, such as increased memory and processing power.  HDVP is designed to improve video playback quality by increasing image quality and reducing artifacts. The HDVP can also be used for general purpose tasks such as 3D rendering or scientific computing.

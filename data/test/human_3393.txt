NGC 495, also occasionally referred to as PGC 5037, UGC 920 or GC 278, is a barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Pisces. It located approximately 184 million light-years from the Solar System and was discovered on 12 September 1784 by astronomer William Herschel. Observation history  The object was discovered by Herschel along with NGC 496 and NGC 499. He initially described the discovery as "Three [NGC 495 along with NGC 496 and 499], eS and F, forming a triangle.". As he observed the trio again the next night, he was able to make out more detail: "Three, forming a [right triangle]; the [right angle] to the south NGC 499, the short leg preceding [NGC 495], the long towards the north [NGC 496].  Those in the legs [NGC 495 and 496] the faintest imaginable; that at the rectangle [NGC 499] a deal larger and brighter, but still very faint."

Harriett Everard (12 March 1844 – 22 December 1907) was an English painter, sculptor and illustrator.  Born in London, Everard studied at the Royal Academy Schools from 1864 to 1868, winning the silver medal for sculpture in 1865. She then travelled in Europe, studying at the Académie Julian in Paris and the School of Fine Arts in Munich.  She returned to London in 1871, and exhibited her first paintings at the Royal Academy. She became known for her portraits and landscapes, working mainly in oil but also producing prints, watercolours, and sculptures. In 1893 she was appointed Professor of Painting at the Royal Academy Schools, a position she held until her death.  Everard was a founding member of the London Salon (1882), and was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1888. She was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1901.

Eucalyptus bunyip is a rare, slender tree that is endemic to the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, Australia. It is a member of the myrtle family, and grows to a height of 10 metres. The bark is rough and scaly, and the leaves are ovate-lanceolate, 7–10 cm long and 2–3 cm wide. The flowers are white and borne in racemes 10–15 cm long. The fruit is a capsule 5–6 cm long and 3–4 cm wide.   The eucalyptus bunyip is poorly known, and only known from a few specimens collected in the 1930s. It is threatened by habitat loss, as it grows in shrubland on steep slopes.

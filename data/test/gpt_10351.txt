The Snowden effect is part of the global debate about the implications of Edward Snowden's disclosures about the US National Security Agency (NSA). Since Snowden's leaks began in June 2013, there has been a global discussion about the legality and morality of surveillance by the NSA and other intelligence agencies.  The revelations about the extent of government surveillance have had a number of consequences. First, they have led to public debate about the extent to which such surveillance is necessary and justifiable. Second, they have led to reforms in some countries, such as Germany, where the Federal Data Protection Authority has enacted new data protection laws in response to concerns raised by Snowden. Third, they have led to increased scrutiny of the activities of intelligence agencies around the world.

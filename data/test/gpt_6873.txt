A notary public ( notary or public notary in American English) is a public official who administers oaths and affirmations, notarizes documents, and performs other legal services. The notary public is appointed by the state or territorial government, and is typically a lawyer or an attorney. In some jurisdictions, notaries are required to have a college degree in law.  The notarial profession has two essential components: the practice of oaths and affirmations, which involves the administration of official documents that are used to prove a statement or fact; and the performance of other legal services, such as the authentication of signatures. The notarial act binds the signers together in a solemn trust and is an official record of their agreement. Notarial certificates may be used as legal evidence.  Notaries are often called upon to provide guidance and support during legal proceedings. They may also be requested to certify copies of documents as accurate copies. The notary public has been considered an important part of society since ancient times. In Greece, for example, the first recorded notary was Theodorus the Atheist, who served in Athens in 429 BC.

The founder is Bahman Mirza Qajar (1810–1884), younger brother of Mohammad Shah Qajar and formerly prince regent and governor of Azerbaijan 1841–1848. In the last quarter of the 19th century, the family was divided into a Russian branch, serving the Tsar, and recognised in 1886 with the titles of Prince Persidskii and Princess Persidskaya styled "His Serene Highness" in the Russian Empire by the Tsar. As well as into a Persian branch in Tehran at the Shah's court, holding the traditional Persian title  of shahzadeh ("prince"). Bahman Mirza used for himself and his mature sons the more familiar style of navvab ("highness"). Many of Bahman Mirza's male offspring were high-ranking officers in the Imperial Russian Army and stayed in the Tsar's service until the October Revolution at Tiflis, Shusha, Ganja and Baku. Many of them served in the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic during the short independence from Russia 1918–1920. With the Soviets coming to power and annexing Azerbaijan, many of Bahman Mirza's sons were executed or fled to Iran.

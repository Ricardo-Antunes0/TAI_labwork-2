Mary Esther Murtfeldt (6 August 1839, New York City â€“ 23 February 1913, Kirkwood) was an American entomologist, botanist, botanical collector, writer and editor. She undertook research on the life histories of insects, describing several species new to science and wrote extensively on entomology. Murtfeldt created a collection of plant specimens that contributed to the scientific knowledge on the plants of Missouri. Life Murtfeldt was born in New York City on the 6th of August 1839 to Esther and Charles W. Murtfeldt. She grew up in Rockford, Illinois but lived most of her adult life with her family in Kirkwood, Missouri. She was partially paralysed by polio in her youth and as a result her ability to walk was restricted. Murtfeldt was educated at home but went on to study at Rockford College from 1858 to 1860. She developed an interest in entomology and botany. This interest was encouraged by the then Missouri state entomologist Charles Valentine Riley who lived with the Murtfeldt family around 1870.

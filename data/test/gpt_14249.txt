Chicks Incorporated were an Australian dance rock trio formed in Sydney in 1987. The group consisted of brothers Tim and Chris Murphy, and childhood friend and drummer, Paul MacNeil.  The group released their debut album, "Chicks Incorporated", in 1988. The album was successful, spawning four singles which reached the top 10 on the Australian charts: "The Heat Is On", "In Your Eyes", "Talk Dirty to Me" and "I Believe in a Thing Called Love".  The group toured extensively throughout Australia and Europe, and their performance at the 1989 Reading festival led to their international breakthrough. Their follow-up album, "Feels Like It's Yesterday", was also well received and spawned two more top 10 singles: "Right Here Waiting" and "New Beginnings".  The group disbanded in 1993 after releasing the album, "The Dance". MacNeil left the band shortly after its release to focus on his solo career.  In 2007, Chicks Incorporated reunited for a series of shows in Australia to celebrate their 25th anniversary. They have since toured sporadically throughout Australia and Europe. In 2018 Chicks Incorporated announced they would be disbanding for good after 25 years of continuous touring.

The town prospered as a trading post and grew into a large city under British rule. After independence in 1947, Walewale became the administrative centre for an area that now extends across Jharkhand and Orissa. The city's development was hampered by frequent floods and droughts until the late 1990s when it began to experience rapid growth as a result of increased industrialisation and migration from rural areas. Today Walewale is one of Jharkhand's most rapidly developing cities and it is home to several large industrial estates and commercial centres as well as several universities and colleges.

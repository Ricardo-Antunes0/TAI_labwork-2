Ian William Geddes Johnson,  (8 December 1936 – 23 March 1984) was an Australian cricketer who played in 37 Tests and 124 ODIs from 1958 to 1971. He was a right-handed batsman and right-arm medium pace bowler.  Johnson made his first-class debut for New South Wales in the 1958–59 season, and played for Australia in the 1958–59 and 1962–63 Ashes series. He was picked for the 1965–66 tour of England, but failed to impress in the Tests and was omitted from the touring party for the final two Tests. He made his Test debut against India in Bombay in November 1965 and scored a century in each innings of Australia's first-ever victory over India at home. Johnson also scored centuries against Pakistan (in Karachi) and South Africa (in Johannesburg). He was vice-captain of Australia in the 1969–70 Test series against England, but had limited opportunities in the Tests due to Glenn McGrath's consistent performance. He retired from international cricket after the 1971 World Cup, having scored 2,527 runs at an average of 37.11 with 12 centuries and 26 half-centuries, taking 117 wickets at an average of 33.14. He later served as coach of New South Wales and Victoria cricket teams.  Johnson died from cancer at the age of 54, just weeks after being appointed coach of Victoria.

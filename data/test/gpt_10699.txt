In art history, the High Renaissance was a period in the development of the arts in Europe, spanning the 14th to 16th centuries. The term is used predominantly to refer to the art produced in Italy during this time, and especially in Florence. The High Renaissance was preceded by the Middle Renaissance and followed by the Late Renaissance.  The term derives from the Italian "Renaissance", meaning "rebirth", and was first used in English in 1858 by John Ruskin. The style of painting and sculpture produced during the High Renaissance is often called Mannerism. The term is used to describe a period in which artists departed from the traditional styles of their predecessors, creating works that were more colourful, emotional and individualistic. It was also a time when artists began to experiment with new techniques and mediums, such as frescoes and mixed media.  The High Renaissance was a time of great artistic achievement in Italy, with many famous painters and sculptors working during this period, including Dante Alighieri, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti and Raphael. Many of the ideas that would lead to the development of modern art were born during the High Renaissance, including the concept of perspective and the use of light and shade in art. The influence of the High Renaissance on later periods is still evident today, especially in European painting.

Crinkley Bottom, also popularly referred to as Blobbyland, was the operating title for a series of British theme parks operating in the 1990s. They were created by Noel Edmonds based on the fictional village of Crinkley Bottom where the Noel's House Party television programme was based. The parks operated based on the popularity of Mr Blobby. Three parks were operated under the Crinkley Bottom name in England by Edmonds' company, Unique. However, all of the parks eventually failed and were either closed or rebranded. Background Noel's House Party was a popular family entertainment programme on the BBC during the 1990s. The programme was hosted by Edmonds in the fictional village of Crinkley Bottom and also included Mr Blobby as a comic relief character that gained fame during the decade. Hoping to capitalise on the popularity of both, Edmonds and his production company Unique looked into ways to open a theme park based around Noel's House Party. The first theme park opened in Cricket St Thomas, Somerset in 1994. It was promoted as "Britain's first TV leisure park".

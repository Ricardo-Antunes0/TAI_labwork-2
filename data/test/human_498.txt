Carmen Get It! is a Tom and Jerry animated short film, released on December 21, 1962. It was the thirteenth and final short in the series to be directed by Gene Deitch and produced by William L. Snyder in Czechoslovakia. This short was Deitch's last with MGM, as Chuck Jones took over production of the Tom and Jerry cartoons shortly afterwards. Plot Tom chases Jerry into the opera house, where Carmen is being performed, but is quickly thrown off the premises by the guard. After an attempt to get in disguised as someone to see the show fails, Tom disguises himself as a musician carrying a double bass case, successfully bluffing his way through by holding the case in front of his body. Spotting a nearby mouse hole, he opens the double bass case, inside which is a cello case, inside which is a viola case, inside which is a violin case, inside which is a fake 24 or 25-inch long violin containing a tape player with a reel-to-reel tape of "Carmen". Rubbing his bow with cheese, Tom starts up the tape as the conductor begins the overture. With the tape covering for him, Tom waves his bow in front of the mouse hole. Fortunately, the scent of cheese draws Jerry out. Tom then smacks Jerry with his bow and catches him before rubbing him over the strings of his violin, but Jerry climbs into the violin's body and speeds up the tape. The noise draws the conductor's ire, who angrily marches up to Tom and smacks him over the head with the violin.

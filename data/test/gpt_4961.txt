Great Palm Island, usually known as Palm Island, is an island in the Whitsunday Islands, a group of islands in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Queensland, Australia.  The island is approximately 900 hectares in size and its population was 1,400 as of the 2016 census. The majority of the population are descendants of the original Palm Islander inhabitants, who were displaced by white settlement in the 19th century. The island has a primary school and a small airstrip. There are plans to rebuild the airstrip to accommodate larger aircraft.

Emit Ecaps is the third album by English techno producer Jonah Sharp under his pseudonym Spacetime Continuum. It was released in February 1996 on Reflective Records in the United Kingdom and on Astralwerks in the United States. After establishing himself as a techno producer but then moving to an ambient style on his previous album Sea Biscuits (1994), Sharp's music on Emit Ecaps balances his techno and ambient styles with influences of drum and bass and jungle music. The name of the album reverses the term 'space time'. Emit Ecaps was a radio success and received acclaim from music journalists who praised Sharp's change in direction. The album was followed in November 1996 by Remit Recaps, a remix album of material from Emit Ecaps, created with the involvement of several producers.

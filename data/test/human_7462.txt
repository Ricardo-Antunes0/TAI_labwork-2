Cee Vee was founded on the land of the former CV Ranch; after the land was sold in 1927, a post office was opened in 1928.  The postmaster wished to name the post office "CV," but as initials were invalid names for post offices according to departmental guidelines, the letter names were spelled out.  A school opened in the area in 1928 and continued until shortly before 1960.  Cee Vee was long a commercial center for a primarily agricultural area, despite its small size.

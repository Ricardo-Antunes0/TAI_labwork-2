The Phra Bang ("Royal Buddha Image in the Temple") is a bronze statue of the Buddha, measuring 61 cm in height and weighing about 9 kg, that is housed in the Wat Phra Kaew temple in Bangkok, Thailand.  The statue was created in 1292 by King Narai of Ayutthaya at the behest of his father, King Ramathibodi I. It was originally placed in the Royal Palace. In 1782, it was moved to its present location in the Wat Phra Kaew temple. The statue is one of the most important religious artefacts in Thailand and is visited by thousands of pilgrims every day.

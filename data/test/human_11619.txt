Nu Horologii, Latinized from ν Horologii, is the Bayer designation for a single star in the southern constellation of Horologium. It was catalogued by the Dutch explorer Frederick de Houtman in 1603. With an apparent visual magnitude of 5.3, this star can be seen with the naked eye from the southern hemisphere. (According to the Bortle scale, it can be seen at night from bright suburban skies.) Based upon parallax measurements made by the Gaia space observatory, Nu Horologii lies at a distance of  light-years from Earth. It is drifting closer to the Sun with a radial velocity of +31 km/s. The stellar classification of A2 V indicates that it is an A-type main sequence star that is generating energy through thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium at its core. Nu Horologii is larger and hotter than the Sun, with 190% of the Sun's mass, 188% of the radius of the Sun, and it shines with 16.7 times the solar luminosity. This is a young star with an estimated age of 540 million years, and it is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 144 km/s along the equator. The effective temperature of the photosphere is 8,308 K, giving it the white-hued glow of an A-type star.

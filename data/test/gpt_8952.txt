The naumachia (in Latin , from the Ancient Greek ναυμαχία, naumachia meaning "water fight") was an ancient form of aquatic combat, involving large vessels filled with water and armed men fought on board.  The naumachia was a popular spectacle in the ancient world, enjoyed by the wealthy and powerful as well as the general public. It flourished from the 6th century BC to the 3rd century AD. It involved three types of vessel: the hippopode (a large, flat-bottomed boat), the cilix (a small, fast boat), and the pente (a large cargo boat). The most famous naumachia were those in which vessels with 50 or more oarsmen fought each other.

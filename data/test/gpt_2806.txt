Yom Kippur Katan ( translation from Hebrew: "Day of Atonement, Second Day") is a custom of fasting and repentance practiced by some Jews on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar.  The custom of Yom Kippur Katan is to fast from the evening of Yom Kippur until the afternoon of the second day. During this time, many Jews also repent for their past year and make a commitment to change their behavior for the upcoming year.

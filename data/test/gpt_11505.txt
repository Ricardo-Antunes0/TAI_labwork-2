The domain name arpa is a top-level domain (TLD) for thearpa, a hierarchical namespace for the ARPANET. Thearpa was created in 1987 as a replacement for the earlier NETINFO and GISS networks.   The domain name arpa is one of the original top-level domains (TLDs) approved by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) in 1988. It is managed by the National Center for Advanced Research in Information and Communications Technology (NCART), a Japanese national research institution.  Thearpa is organized into hierarchies, each of which represents a network layer in the ARPANET. The top-level domain arpa represents the entire namespace. Domains at the second level represent individual protocols, such as HTTP and DNS. Third-level domains represent individual hosts on the network, while fourth-level domains represent individual users.

In engineering, iso-elastic refers to a system's ability to return to its original shape after being deformed. This property is important for systems that must maintain their shape under loads, such as aircraft wings or automobile suspension systems.  Iso-elasticity is important for systems that must maintain their shape under loads. For example, airplane wings must be able to deform slightly in response to the wind, yet return to their original shape once the wind stops blowing. Likewise, automobile suspension systems must be able to handle small bumps in the road without bouncing too much. If a system does not exhibit iso-elasticity, it will not be able to maintain its desired shape under load and may eventually fail.

Morleys Hall, a moated hall converted to two houses, is situated at  on Morleys Lane, on the edge of Astley Moss in Astley in the historic county of Lancashire and the ceremonial county of Greater Manchester, England. It was largely rebuilt in the 19th century on the site of a medieval timber house. The hall is a Grade II* listed building and the moat a scheduled ancient monument. Morleys is a private residence. History The More-Leghe mentioned in documents in the early 13th century gave its name to the family who lived there until about 1381 when it passed to the Leylands. The Leylands remained at Morleys until the male line failed and passed to the Tyldesleys through Ann Leyland who married Edward, second son of Thurstan Tyldesley of Wardley Hall in 1550. Ann, daughter of Thomas Leyland, and Edward Tyldesley of Wardley Hall eloped from Morleys in 1547. Her father was not in favour of the romance as Edward was a second son with no prospects of an inheritance. Anne was locked in her room but escaped through the window with an improvised rope and joined Edward who pulled her across the moat and went to Wardley Hall and were married. The elopement became the subject of an unfinished poem by Branwell BrontÃ«. Edward Tyldesley inherited Morleys in 1564.

Lancs/Cheshire Division Two (usually referred to as Lancs/Cheshire 2) was a regional English Rugby Union league for teams in Cheshire, Merseyside, Lancashire and Greater Manchester at level 9 of the English rugby union system.  Teams are promoted up into Lancs/Cheshire 1 and since the cancellation of Lancs/Cheshire 3 at the end of the 2019–20 season there is no relegation.  The division was initially known as North-West West 2 when it was created in 1987, and had a number of different names since with South Lancs/Cheshire 2 being the longest running.  The division switched to its current name for the 2018–19 season due to the restructuring of the northern leagues by the RFU as a result of 19 Lancashire clubs withdrawing from RFU competitions across the leagues to form their own competitions. Each season three teams from Lancs/Cheshire 2 are picked to take part in the RFU Junior Vase (a national competition for clubs at levels 9-12) - two clubs affiliated with the Cheshire RFU, the other with the Lancashire RFU.

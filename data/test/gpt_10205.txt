George Stephenson (9 June 1781 â€“ 12 August 1848) was an English mechanical engineer and railway pioneer. He is best known for his work on the locomotive steam engine, which he designed and built in 1814. This made possible the first public railway line in the world, the Stockton and Darlington Railway, which opened in 1825. Stephenson also designed the first high-speed railcar, the Rocket, which was never built.  Stephenson is also recognised for his theories of elasticity and stress, which helped develop engineering practice. He was a founding member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and his contributions to engineering have been honoured by several awards and memorials.

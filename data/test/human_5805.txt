Coltrane Jazz is the sixth studio album by jazz musician John Coltrane, released in early 1961 on Atlantic Records, catalogue SD 1354. Featuring Coltrane alongside his former Miles Davis bandmates- pianist Wynton Kelly, bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Jimmy Cobb- with the exception of "Village Blues", a landmark recording in Coltraneâ€™s career as it marks the first session of the classic John Coltrane Quartet with pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Steve Davis and drummer Elvin Jones. Background In 1959, Miles Davis' business manager Harold Lovett negotiated a contract for Coltrane with Atlantic, the terms including a $7000 annual guarantee. After having recorded most of Giant Steps, Coltrane started having bridge problems, and did not return to a recording studio for six months. In the late fall, he employed the rhythm section from the Miles Davis Quintet for two Atlantic sessions, which yielded the bulk of this album and the track "Naima" for Giant Steps. "Like Sonny" is a tribute to colleague Sonny Rollins, whose playing Coltrane greatly admired.

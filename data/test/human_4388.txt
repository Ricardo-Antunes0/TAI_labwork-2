Gila Goldstein (; 18 December 1947– 5 February 2017) was an Israeli actress, singer and transgender rights activist. She was one of the first activists of the Aguda, the oldest and largest LGBT organization in Israel. She is considered Israel's second transgender woman (after Rina Natan). Biography Gila Goldstein was born in Turin as Avraham Goldstein and assigned male at birth. After immigrating to Israel, she lived in Haifa. Goldstein realized she was transgender in 1960 and changed her name to Gila. She worked as a prostitute in Haifa before having sex reassignment surgery in Belgium in 1960 – the first officially documented sex reassignment surgery for an Israeli. In the early 1970s, Goldstein lived in Europe and worked as a dancer and striptease performer. When she returned to Israel, she performed in nightclubs and bars, including Bar 51. She served as the prototype of one of the characters in Bar 51 directed by Amos Guttman.

Straight-acting is a term for a same-sex sexual orientation or behavior that is not considered deviant or abnormal in the cultural context in which it occurs.  Straight-acting people may identify as heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual, but they may also exhibit behaviors or orientations that do not fit neatly into any of these categories. For example, some straight-actors may exclusively engage in sexual behaviors with members of the same sex, while others may not show any overt sexual behavior at all.  Because straight-acting people exist outside of traditional conceptions of sexuality, they often face discrimination and exclusion from society. They may also experience social isolation and difficulty finding partners or friends. Because straight-acting people are a very small minority, their experiences and perspectives are often largely lacking in research and discussion.  This introduction will provide an overview of the Straight-acting community and discuss their unique challenges and experiences.

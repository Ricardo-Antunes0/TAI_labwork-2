Vera Kirillovna Zakharova (; 12 July 1920  1 January 2010) was a Po-2 air ambulance pilot in the Soviet Air Force during World War II, a student of aviation pioneer Valery Kuzmin, and the first Yakut woman pilot. Early life Zakharova was born on 12 July 1920 in the village of Delgey, Yakut oblast, located within the present-day Olyokminsky district of Sakha; she had seven siblings. Her father Kirill, a Yakut, was a schoolteacher, and her mother Yevdokiya, a Russian was a doctor. Because her mother was not fluent in the Yakut language, Vera often helped her by being a translator. Soon after she was born her family moved to the village of Churapcha, where her father was from. There she completed primary school before moving to Yakutsk city in 1934. In autumn the next year her brother Innokenty joined the local glider flight school, leading to Vera joining in 1937 and becoming the first Yakut girl admitted to the aeroclub. There she learned to fly the Po-2 trainer under the instruction of Valery Kuzmin, the first Yakut pilot. Soon she earned the status of parachute instructor after completing her 19th parachute jump. In 1940 she moved to Moscow to attend the Moscow Aviation School, but due to enrollment delay she initially attended the Moscow Institute of Physical Culture. However, she attended only one semester before leaving due to financial difficulties, which forced her to return to Yakutsk.

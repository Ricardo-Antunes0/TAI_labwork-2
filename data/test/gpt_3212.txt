George Robert Fischer (May 4, 1937 – October 18, 2009) was an American mathematician and Professor Emeritus at UC Berkeley.  Fischer was born in Buffalo, New York, on May 4, 1937. He earned his undergraduate degree from Cornell University in 1959 and his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1964. Fischer joined the UC Berkeley faculty in 1965, where he remained until his death. He was a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Fischer's research was in partial differential equations and mathematical physics. His work included the theory of lattices and Lie groups, the solutions to Navier–Stokes equations, and the dynamics of interacting systems. He also made significant contributions to the theory of chaos and fractals.  Fischer died on October 18, 2009 at the age of 72 after a long illness.

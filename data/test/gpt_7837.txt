The Flee-Rekkers – also known as  The Dutch Flee-Rekkers – were a group of Dutch resistance fighters during the Second World War.  The Flee-Rekkers were formed in 1941, when the Netherlands was occupied by Nazi Germany. The group aimed to help Allied soldiers escape from the country, by providing them with false identities and transport. They also helped to smuggle weapons and supplies into the country.  The Flee-Rekkers played a significant role in helping to liberate the Netherlands from Nazi occupation. They were also responsible for killing several members of the Gestapo, and helped to liberate Amsterdam and other important Dutch cities.  After the war, the Flee-Rekkers were awarded medals for their bravery. They continue to be honoured today, and are considered national heroes in the Netherlands.

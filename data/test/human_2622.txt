Edward Dominic Fenwick,  (August 19, 1768 â€“ September 26, 1832) was an American prelate of the Catholic Church, a Dominican friar and the first Bishop of the Diocese of Cincinnati. Early life Edward Fenwick was born August 19, 1768 on the family plantation on the Patuxent River, in the Colony of Maryland to Colonel Ignatius Fenwick and Sarah Taney. Colonel Fenwick was a military figure of the American Revolution and one of the early Catholic families of Maryland. At that time, Jesuit missionaries ministered to Maryland Catholics. His first cousin Benedict J. Fenwick, a Jesuit, became the second bishop of Boston; another cousin, Enoch Fenwick was also ordained a Jesuit priest and was eventually named president of Georgetown College. Many families sent their sons abroad to study, and at sixteen years of age, Edward was sent to the Dominican Holy Cross College in Bornem, near Antwerp, Belgium, where his uncle was a teacher. The school was under the jurisdiction of the English Province of Dominicans.

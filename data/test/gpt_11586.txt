The Vote tells the story of a group of friends and family who are forced to confront the consequences of their actions in the run-up to the 2015 UK general election. The play is set in the home of one of the characters, Liz, on the night before the election. Liz is trying to come to terms with the fact that her brother, Alex, has decided to vote for UKIP, a party with which he has very little in common. Liz's husband, Dan, is also struggling with his conscience; he doesn't want to vote for Labour but he can't bring himself to support UKIP either. Meanwhile, Liz's mother is trying to get her head around why Alex would choose to vote for a party that she believes is racist and anti-immigrant. The Vote is ultimately about choices - what do we do when we're faced with difficult decisions?

The Brass Lantern is a traveling trophy for the winners in the  Cumberlandsâ€“Union football rivalry.  The award is presented in American college football rivalry games contested annually between the Cumberlands Patriots football team of the University of the Cumberlands and the Union Bulldogs football team of Union College.  The schools are located less than  apart in adjacent eastern Kentucky counties, with Cumberlands in Williamsburg and Union in Barbourville. Each annual contest is referred to as the Battle for the Brass Lantern, also locally referred to by some as "THE" game of the year. The Patriots and the Bulldogs first met in 1905, making this rivalry one of the oldest in all of NAIA football.  Since that initial meeting, the series has been discontinued and restarted at two different points in history.  In the most recent renewal, the two teams have been meeting annually since 1985.  Since 1987, the two teams have also been competing against each other and others as members of the Mid-South Conference and its predecessors.

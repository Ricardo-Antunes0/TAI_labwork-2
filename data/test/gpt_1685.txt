George Gardiner (1608/1615 - c. 1677), sometimes spelled Gardiner, was an English settler in the New World. He is best known for his role in the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and for his leadership of the Puritan faction in the colony.  Gardiner was born in 1608 or 1615 in Horsham, Sussex, England, to a wealthy family. He left England in 1638 or 1639, aboard the ship "Discovery", and arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1639. There he joined the Separatist congregation led by John Robinson. He soon became one of Robinson's leading assistants and supporters.  In 1643 Gardiner was elected deputy governor of the colony, and served until his death. As deputy governor, he played a leading role in the colony's early years. He helped to establish relations with the native tribes, negotiated treaties with them, and defended the colony against its enemies. In 1646 Gardiner was elected governor of the colony, serving until 1653. During his time as governor, Gardiner led the Puritan faction in opposition to Governor William Bradford's predominately Anglican administration.  Gardiner died sometime between 1677 and 1679 in Boston, Massachusetts Bay Colony. He was buried at Charlestown Burying Ground.  George Gardiner has been portrayed in various films and television shows about the American Revolution, including "The Patriot" (2000), "The War of The Worlds" (2005), "1775" (

Lathyrus tuberosus (also known as the tuberous lathyrus, the Italian lily, or French lily) is a perennial herbaceous flowering plant in the family Amaryllidaceae. It is native to temperate and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia, and has been naturalized in many other parts of the world.  The tuberous lily is a robust herbaceous perennial plant growing to 1–2 m tall, with a fleshy rhizome system that produces numerous long taproots. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, 10–30 cm long and 5–10 cm broad, with a serrated margin. The flowers are produced in a raceme or head, with 50–200 small white flowers. The fruit is a cylindrical pod 2–5 cm long, containing several seeds.  The tuberous lily is used as an ornamental plant and for its flower buds, which are used in perfume making.

Sebaceous carcinoma, also known as sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGc), sebaceous cell carcinoma, and meibomian gland carcinoma is an uncommon malignant cutaneous tumor. Most are typically about 1.4Â cm at presentation. SGc originates from sebaceous glands in the skin and, therefore, may originate anywhere in the body where these glands are found. SGc can be divided into 2 types: periocular and extraocular. The periocular region is rich in sebaceous glands making it a common site of origin. The cause of these lesions in the vast majority of cases is unknown. Occasional cases may be associated with Muir-Torre syndrome. SGc accounts for approximately 0.7% of all skin cancers, and the incidence of SGc is highest in Caucasian, Asian, and Indian populations. Due to the rarity of this tumor and variability in clinical and histological presentation, SGc is often misdiagnosed as an inflammatory condition or a more common neoplasm. SGc is commonly treated with wide local excision or Mohs micrographic surgery, and the relative survival rates at 5 and 10 years are 92.72 and 86.98%, respectively. Epidemiology  SGc accounts for approximately 0.7% of all skin cancers and 0.2 to 4.6% of all malignant cutaneous neoplasms. Notable risk factors include age, gender, and race. Over 98% of SGc occur in patients over the age of 40. The mean age of diagnosis for periocular and extraocular SGc is around 67 years. Periocular SGc tends to be more common in women, while extraocular SGc tends to be more common in men. SGc is extraordinarily rare in children with only a few cases reported. There is a higher incidence of SGc in Caucasians, Asians, and Indians. While SGc affects Caucasians over 80% of the time, SGc tends to be more prevalent in the Eastern versus Western Hemisphere, contributing to 33% of eyelid malignancies in China versus 1-5.5% in Caucasians. The higher incidence of SGc in Asian populations may be due to the lower incidence of other eyelid tumors or genetic.

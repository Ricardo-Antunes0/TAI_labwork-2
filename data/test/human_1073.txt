The Mariana fruit bat (Pteropus mariannus), also known as the Mariana flying fox, and the fanihi in Chamorro, is a megabat found only in the Mariana Islands and Ulithi (an atoll in the Caroline Islands). Habitat loss has driven it to endangered status, and it is listed as threatened by the US Fish and Wildlife Service.  Poachers and food hunters, other animals, and natural causes have led to the decline. Description The Mariana fruit bat is a mid-sized bat which weighs , and has a forearm length of 5.3 to 6.1 in (13.4 to 15.6Â cm).  Males of the species are slightly larger in size than the females.  Their abdomens are colored from black to brown, while also having gray hairs.  The mantle and the neck are a brighter brown to golden brown color and the head varies from brown to black.  Their ears are rounded and their eyes large, giving them the features of a canid, so many megabats are called flying foxes.

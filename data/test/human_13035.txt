Lake Leavitt (not to be confused with Leavitt Lake, which is an alpine lake in Mono County) is a reservoir in Lassen County, California, United States. The 1142 acres (462 ha) lake was created in 1889 from a natural sinkhole by Benjamin H. Leavitt. It is now part of the Honey Lake Valley irrigation system and managed by the Lassen Irrigation Company. The area is currently being remediated due to damage from cattle ranches, and is home to waterfowl, mule deer, pronghorn antelope, and other local species. Construction Lake Leavitt is 1142 acres (462 ha) and formed by the Lake Leavitt Dam, completed in 1889 by Benjamin H. Leavitt. Leavitt's son, Victor E. Perry, worked on the dams construction. He tricked the workers of the dam to work harder and by planting a gold nugget at the lake, and when it was discovered, he declared all gold found by a miner was theirs to keep so long as work continued. workers worked far more in hopes of finding gold themselves, which led to them working more hours.

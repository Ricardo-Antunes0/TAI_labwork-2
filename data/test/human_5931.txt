The Naǵyz Ak Zhol (English: True Bright Path) is a former Kazakh political party. It was founded by Bulat Abilov, Altynbek Sarsenbaev, Oraz Jandosov, and Tulegen Zhukeyev, and held its first constituent congress on 29 April 2005. Sarsenbaev was murdered on 12 February 2006, sparking much protest from party opposition. Origin Its constituent congress was held on 29 April 2005. The party was formed as a split from the Ak Zhol party. Differences between the platforms of Ak Zhol and Naǵyz Ak Zhol parties are vague, if they exist at all. The split seems to be a result of personal struggles within the Ak Zhol leadership, which have effectively plagued Kazakh opposition since independence. On 13 February 2005, Ak Zhol Party co-chairman Alikhan Baimenov, cast a vote of no confidence in  Altynbek Sarsenbayev, another co-chairman, alleging that Sarsenbayev had been violating the party constitution prohibiting collaboration with other political parties. Sarsenbayev had been active in the formation of  the “Coordinating Council of Democratic Forces,” an alliance including  the Communist Party and the Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan movement.  Apparently this dispute caused the split in Ak Zhol Party.

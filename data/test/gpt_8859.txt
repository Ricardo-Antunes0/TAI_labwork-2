In computer science, a session identifier, session ID, or session token is a unique identifier for a given session of a computer communication session. Session IDs are used to identify and track the progress of a communication session, and to prevent two or more users from communicating with each other simultaneously.   Session IDs are also used to keep track of which user is currently active in a communication session. For example, if a web application allows multiple users to collaborate on a document, each user may have a unique session ID that is associated with their account. When the web application needs to send a message to the user with the corresponding session ID, it can do so without having to know their IP address or login name.

Wildlife conservation refers to the practice of managing, conserving and protecting wild species and their habitats. The aim of wildlife conservation is to maintain the health and vitality of wild populations and their ecosystems, which in turn protects human well-being.  Wildlife conservation is a broad field that draws on a variety of disciplines, including biology, conservation biology, zoology, ecology, forestry, law, and management. The goal of wildlife conservation is to sustain the natural diversity of ecosystems and the biological populations within them for the benefit of present and future generations.  Wildlife conservation has been practiced for centuries, with some of the earliest examples dating back to ancient civilizations. Today, wildlife conservation efforts are directed at protecting a wide range of species ranging from iconic animals such as lions and elephants to less well-known species such as butterflies and spiders.  There are several ways to support wildlife conservation. Some people contribute money to organizations that work to protect wildlife; others volunteer their time to help out with conservation efforts; others support legislation that helps to protect wildlife; and still others advocate for wildlife preservation through public education.

Project Isinglass was the code name given to two heavily classified, crewed reconnaissance aircraft studied by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as potential replacements for the Lockheed A-12 and SR-71 during the mid-1960s. The first proposal under the Isinglass name, a high-altitude plane to fly at , was considered an insufficient advancement over existing aircraft; the second, much more advanced design, sometimes referred to as Project Rheinberry, was an air-launched,  rocket-powered boost-glide aircraft that would use a very-high-altitude trajectory to avoid defenses. This aircraft was considered too costly for development, and the project was abandoned in 1967. Origins Project Isinglass was developed as a result of the vulnerability of existing crewed reconnaissance aircraft, such as the Lockheed U-2 and the Lockheed A-12, to Soviet air defenses in the early 1960s, catalysed by the shooting down in May 1960 of Francis Gary Powers. Although there were continuing plans to overfly the Soviet Union with the A-12 – referred to by the CIA as Project Oxcart – these failed to come to pass, and the CIA began plans for an aircraft with superior performance to replace Oxcart.

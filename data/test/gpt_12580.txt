Born in the town of Atocha, Madrid, on 18 September 1898, Francisco Soria Aedo was the son of a schoolteacher. After completing his secondary education in 1917, he entered the University of Madrid, where he studied mathematics and physics under the supervision of José Luis de Laplace and Manuel José de Larrazabal. In 1922 he obtained his doctorate under the supervision of Larrazabal with a thesis on the theory of elasticity.  After completing his studies at the University of Madrid, Aedo moved to the University of Cambridge, England, where he worked with John Venn and Max Born.

Francis Huntington Snow (June 29, 1840 â€“ November 10, 1916) was an American historian and college professor who specialized in Early American history. He was a leading figure in the field of New England historical scholarship in the late 19th century and early 20th century.  Snow was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, on June 29, 1840. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard University, where he earned his A.B. in 1859 and his A.M. in 1860. He then studied law at the Harvard Law School, but abandoned it to pursue a career in academia. He became a professor of history at Amherst College in 1873, where he remained until his retirement in 1911.  Snow is best known for his work on Early American history, which focused on New England and the Atlantic coast region. His most notable book is The History of the United States from the Revolution to the Civil War (1887), which remains a standard work on that subject. He also wrote extensively on colonial history and American constitutional history. Snow was a member of the American Antiquarian Society and the Davenport Academy of Science and Art. He died in 1916 at age 80 years old.

KOLR, virtual and VHF digital channel 10, is a CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Springfield, Missouri, United States. Owned by Wichita Falls, Texas–based Mission Broadcasting, it is operated under a shared services agreement (SSA) by Nexstar Media Group, making it sister to Nexstar's duopoly of Springfield-licensed MyNetworkTV affiliate KOZL-TV (channel 27) and Osage Beach–licensed Fox affiliate KRBK (channel 49). The stations share studios on East Division Street in Springfield, while KOLR's transmitter is located on Switchgrass Road, north of Fordland. History The station first signed on the air on March 14, 1953, as KTTS-TV; it was founded by the Independent Broadcasting Company, owners of KTTS radio (1400 AM, now KSGF on AM 1260, and 94.7 FM). Channel 10 originally operated from studio facilities located downtown, on the southwest corner of Walnut and Jefferson Streets in the Springfield Chamber of Commerce building. The station has been a CBS affiliate since its sign-on; however, it also carried a secondary affiliation with ABC, which was shared with primary NBC affiliate KYTV (channel 3) until KMTC (channel 27, now KOZL-TV) signed on in 1968.

Robin Reed (October 20, 1899 â€“ December 20, 1978) was an American amateur and professional wrestler and wrestling coach. Throughout his amateur career he never lost a wrestling match, official or unofficial, to anyone at any weight class.  He was known for winning a gold medal at the 1924 Summer Olympics, leading Oregon State to its first team national championship, and for consistently wrestling in the 170 pound weight division despite his actual weight being close to 140. Reed was a professional world welterweight champion and held the title for many years. Early years Reed was born in Pettigrew, Arkansas, but first took up wrestling at Portland's Franklin High School, where he took the class in order to get out of having to take gym.  He is quoted as saying: "I needed gymnasium credits to graduate from high school, but I didn't want any gym because I was already getting all the exercise I needed operating an air hammer at the shipyards.  I was only 125 pounds and could barely hold onto that air hammer, so I was getting all the gym I needed."  He learned quickly and dominated the competition, going undefeated throughout his time there.

PAVE is a United States Air Force Research Laboratory project to develop a new generation of stealthy fighters.  The PAVE program was initiated in the early 1990s as a response to the growing realization that the United States Air Force (USAF) would soon be unable to maintain its edge in air superiority over potential enemies. PAVE was designed to develop a new generation of stealthy fighters that could overcome the advanced air defense systems of potential adversaries.  The project is divided into two phases: the Initial Development phase, which began in 1993, and the Full-Scale Development phase, which began in 2000. As of December 2012, the program had cost US$4.1 billion and produced only a concept demonstrator aircraft, the F-22 Raptor.

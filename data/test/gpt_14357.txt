Sophie Anita Treadwell (October 3, 1885 â€“ May 6, 1916) was an American mountaineer and explorer who made significant contributions to the exploration of the Alaska Range and the Yukon Territory.  Treadwell was born in October 1885 in Portland, Maine, to parents Edwin and Ada Treadwell. She attended Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, where she was a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority. In 1909, she married Andrew Alexander "Andy" Thomas, with whom she had two children.  In 1913, Treadwell became one of the first women to summit Mount Everest with her husband and fellow mountaineer George Leigh Mallory. The pair became lost on their way down from the summit and were found dead on May 6, 1916, just below the summit of Everest. Treadwell's body was not recovered until August 29 of that year and her death is widely believed to have been caused by exposure and Mallory's fatal Final Summit Fall.

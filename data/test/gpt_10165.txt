The Free Imperial knights  were free, noble and honourable knights that served the Holy Roman Emperor. They were a part of the Imperial Knightly Order, which was founded in 1122. The knights were originally recruited from the ranks of the nobility, but over time they came to include commoners as well. The order was disbanded in 1808, but was re-established in 1978.

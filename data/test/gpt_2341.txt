Dartmoor Preservation Association (DPA) is one of the UK's leading land trust organisations, working to protect and promote the natural and cultural heritage of Dartmoor.  Formed in 1969, the DPA is a registered charity with a mission to protect and promote the natural and cultural heritage of Dartmoor. The organisation works to conserve Dartmoor's unique landscape, wildlife, and cultural heritage for the benefit of present and future generations.  The DPA has a long history of involvement in Dartmoor conservation. The organisation was instrumental in the development of the Dartmoor National Park, and has since played a leading role in the protection of other important Dartmoor landscapes, such as Exmoor National Park and Tavistock Range.  Today, the DPA employs a team of dedicated conservationists who work to protect Dartmoor's endangered species, heritage sites, and natural landscapes. The organisation also works collaboratively with other organisations to achieve common goals, such as campaigning against road building on Dartmoor.  The DPA is committed to ensuring that everyone can enjoy the beauty of Dartmoor, regardless of their opinion on land conservation. The organisation runs educational programmes aimed at visitors and locals alike, and offers free access to much of its land for public recreation.

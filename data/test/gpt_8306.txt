The Rapa fruit dove (Ptilinopus huttoni) is a species of bird in the family Columbidae. It is endemic to New Zealand.  The Rapa fruit dove is a small passerine bird, measuring 16 to 18 cm in length and weighing 32 to 36 g. The plumage is mainly brown, with a white belly and a black head and neck. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are more boldly coloured.  The Rapa fruit dove feeds mainly on fruits, although it will also take insects and seeds. It nests in trees, building a loosely woven cup of twigs and roots. Three or four eggs are laid, and the chicks fledge at around two months old.

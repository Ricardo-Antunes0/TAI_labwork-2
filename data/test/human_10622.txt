Cameron Pearce Norman (born 12 October 1995) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defender for Newport County. Club career Born in Norwich, Norman joined Norwich City at the age of 10 and was promoted to the under-18 squad as a scholar two years later. A key figure during their FA Youth Cup campaign in 2013, in which Norwich beat Chelsea to win the competition for the first time in 30 years, Norman went on to sign his first professional contract in May 2014. On 29 October 2015, Norman joined National League side Woking on a one-month loan deal and made his professional debut during their 1–0 away defeat against Kidderminster Harriers two days later. Following several loan extensions, Norman became a regular in Woking's starting eleven and scored his first goal for the club during their emphatic 2–1 away victory over Forest Green Rovers, which ended Forest Green's hopes of an automatic promotion place.

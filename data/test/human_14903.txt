Ami Kassar is the founder and CEO of MultiFunding, and the author of The Growth Dilemma. He is a small business advocate and a nationally renowned expert on access to capital for entrepreneurs. In addition, Kassar writes a regular column for Inc.com and is a speaker at universities and business events across the country on topics such as entrepreneurship and access to capital. Kassar's company, MultiFunding, has helped over 700 entrepreneurs across America raise capital for their businesses. Kassar is also known for his research on the small business lending market, in which he confronts and challenges some of the largest banks in America for their lending records to small businesses. Kassar concluded that smaller community-oriented banks hold a disproportionately large share of small business loan balances.  His research led to the development of Banking Grades, an online tool that grades every US bank on their small business lending.

Haggahot Maimuniyyot (Hebrew: הגהות מיימוניות) is a 13th-century halakhic work authored by Meir HaKohen. It is one of the most important sources for the halakhic rulings of the scholars of Germany and France, and it is one of the defining halakhic works of the Ashkenazi tosafists. The work consists of supplemental notes (Haggahot) to the Mishneh Torah of Maimonides, with the objective of implanting contemporary Sephardic thought to Germany and France, while juxtaposing it to contemporary Ashkenazi halakhic customs. Publication  The work may originally have been written on the margins of the Mishneh Torah, as it appears in early manuscripts. However, the first publication was in the 1509 Constantinople edition of the Mishneh Torah. The work was later published again in 1524 in Venice. There are differences between the editions of 1509 and 1524, some of which are material. The wording of the glosses in the Venice edition (from which the later editions were printed) is more original and the author generally speaks in the first person, while the wording of the 1509 edition shows signs of being a later version. Additionally certain passages appear in the Constantinople version which are absent from the Venice version, and vice versa. The Constantinople edition contains additions that may have been added by the editor.

Banksia wonganensis is a large shrub endemic to Western Australia that, until 2007, was previously known as Dryandra wonganensis. It occurs within a small area in the vicinity of the Wongan Hills. It grows on lateritic soils in open woodland or amongst dense shrub. It is rare, but does not appear to be endangered. Description It is a sprawling or erect shrub, up to  high, without a lignotuber. Leaves are  long, and nine to 18 millimetres wide, and pinnatifid, with four to nine triangular lobes on each side, before tapering to a fine point. They are often strongly curved. Flowers are bright yellow, and occur in heads of 45 to 50 flowers, up to  across. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth made up of four fused tepals, and one long wiry style; the head of the style is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but breaks free at anthesis. After flowering, follicles develop in the woody base of the flower head, each containing one or sometimes two seeds.

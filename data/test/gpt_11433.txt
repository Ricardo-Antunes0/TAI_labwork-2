New Echota was the capital of the Cherokee Nation during the 18th century. The town was located in present-day Georgia, about sixteen miles west of the modern city of Atlanta.  New Echota was founded in 1736 by Oconostota and his Cherokee followers, who had migrated from the south. The town served as the political and religious center of the Cherokee Nation, and its population grew to more than two thousand by the early 18th century. In 1760, New Echota was attacked by a coalition of white settlers led by James Edward Oglethorpe. The town was sacked and burned, and most of its inhabitants were killed or taken captive.  The ruins of New Echota remain visible today. The site has been preserved as a historic site and is open to visitors.

NLS, or the "oN-Line System", was a computer system developed jointly by Bell Labs and AT&T in the early 1970s. It was the first commercial computer system to use a character-based interface instead of a keyboard/display terminal interface.  NLS was designed to be a collaborative system, allowing multiple users to access the same computer simultaneously. It was also the first computer system to support international text input and output.  NLS was commercially unsuccessful, and was eventually discontinued in the late 1980s. However, its legacy can be seen in modern computer systems, such as Windows NT and Mac OS X, which both use a character-based interface.

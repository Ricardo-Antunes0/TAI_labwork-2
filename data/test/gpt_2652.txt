A fern (Polypodiopsida or  Polypodiophyta ) is a type of vascular plant that produces spores by means of spores, rather than flowers. A fern's fronds are attached directly to the stem or branches via a rhizome. This type of plant typically has a single, large leaf at the base of the stem.  Ferns have been around for over 200 million years and can be found on every continent except Antarctica. Various species are used as ornamental plants, such as the common fern (Polypodium vulgare), the Christmas fern (Osmunda cinnamomea), and the Irish spring fern (Athyrium filix-femina). Ferns are also used as food plants by some insects, such as the larvae of some Lepidoptera species.

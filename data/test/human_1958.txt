Content In each film, Gauntier plays Nan, a Confederate spy during the Civil War who often cross-dresses in order to achieve her physically daring missions.  Gauntier also reprised the role of Nan in The Little Soldier of ’64 (1911) and A Daughter of the Confederacy (1913); the latter was produced by Gauntier's production company, the Gene Gauntier Feature Players. The series was reportedly inspired by real-life spy Belle Boyd.

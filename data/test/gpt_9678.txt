A talking clock (also called a speaking watch, talking alarm clock, or talking watch) is a clock that uses voice recognition software to announce the time. The first talking watch was marketed in 1984 by Sony.  Talking clocks are becoming more popular as technology advances and people are increasingly reliant on electronic devices. They are convenient for people who have trouble reading clocks or who have trouble waking up in the morning. They can also be helpful for people with hearing disabilities.  There are a few different types of talking clocks. Some clocks have a built-in speaker that you can use to listen to the time. Other clocks have a separate speaker and microphone that you can use to talk to the clock.  Some Talking clocks also have features that help you keep track of your schedule. Some Talking clocks can tell you the time in different time zones, or can tell you the time in both English and Spanish.

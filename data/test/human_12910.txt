The Tomorrow Children was an adventure video game developed by Q-Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was announced during Gamescom 2014 at Sony's press conference in August 2014. Development Engadget has described the game as "a mix of Minecraft-esque collaborative building, social economics and a Soviet Union-themed post-apocalyptic dystopia." The Tomorrow Children runs on a proprietary game engine developed by Q-Games. The game's graphics engine utilizes new technology, aiming to achieve a Pixar-like pre-rendered CGI look with real-time 3D graphics. It utilizes the PlayStation 4's Async Compute technology extensively. It features new lighting techniques developed by Q-Games, such as cascaded voxel cone ray tracing, which simulates lighting in real-time and uses more realistic reflections rather than screen space reflections. This allows real-time global illumination, without any need for pre-calculated or pre-baked lighting. It supports direct and indirect illumination in real-time, and up to three bounces of light per pixel from all directions (compared to one bounce for Pixar films). It also features deformable landscapes, with layered depth cubes, representing the world as volumes, which are then converted to polygons as needed.

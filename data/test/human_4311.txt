The main attraction of Fractorydale was the pond, that is where most industries started up and it was a beautiful place to spend time. The big tall colourful maple trees lining the main pond in the autumn made for a beautiful walk and during the winter the pond would freeze over to create a fantastic skating rink that the whole community shared.

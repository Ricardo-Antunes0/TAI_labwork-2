Horatio Powys (20 November 1805â€“31 May 1877) was an English poet, critic and author. He is best known for his long narrative poem The White Goddess (1848), which has been called "the most important poem of the Victorian period".  Powys was born in 1805 in the Welsh town of Llanelly, which he later described as being "near the sea, and on a hill", and had a Catholic upbringing. After attending Carmarthen Grammar School he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics and classics but also developed a love of poetry. In 1827 he published his first collection of poems, Poems Chiefly Lyrical.  In 1830 Powys married Louisa Powys (1808-1887), the daughter of a wealthy London wine merchant. They had six children: one son who died young and five daughters. In 1846 Powys moved to London to take up a position as assistant editor of the Morning Chronicle but he resigned after only two months due to ill health. Nevertheless, his influence on Victorian poetry was considerable; among his pupils were Alfred Tennyson, Robert Browning and William Morris.  Powys died in 1877 in Meudon, France, where he had spent many years of his retirement.

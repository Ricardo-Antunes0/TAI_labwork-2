The Parkerâ€“Hulme murder case began in the early hours of Easter Monday, 17 April 1912, when Edward Parker, a wealthy businessman and Liberal MP for Manchester, was found dead in his home in Belgravia. He had been struck on the head with a blunt instrument and his throat had been cut.  The prime suspects were his wife, Maud, her lover, John Hulme, and Hulme's brother-in-law, Sidney Herbert. The four were all arrested and tried at the Old Bailey. Maud was found guilty of murder and was hanged in March 1913. Hulme was found guilty of manslaughter and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was released from prison in October 1913 after serving 12 years. Sidney Herbert was found not guilty of any crime.

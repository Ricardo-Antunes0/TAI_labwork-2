William of Modena ( â€“ 31 March 1185) was Count of Modena and Reggio from 1183 until his death.  William was the son of Roger II of Sicily, who in turn was the son of Roger I of Sicily. He succeeded his father as Count of Modena and Reggio in 1183, and in 1195 he was created Duke of Milan by his brother-in-law Emperor Henry VI. In 1202 he became King of Sicily when his brother Frederick II died childless.  William is chiefly remembered for his role in the Third Crusade, during which he led the army of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II against the forces of Sultan Saladin. In 1227 he was crowned King of Jerusalem at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. William died in 1285, having ruled over an extensive empire that spanned from Italy to Jerusalem and from Sicily to Germany.

William Thornton Mustard  (August 8, 1914 â€“ December 11, 1987) was a Canadian physician and cardiac surgeon. In 1949, he was one of the first to perform open-heart surgery using a mechanical heart pump and biological lung on a dog at the Banting Institute. He developed two operations named for him: the "Mustard operation" in orthopedics used to help hip use in people with polio and the "Mustard cardiovascular procedure" used to help correct heart problems in "blue babies," which has saved thousands of children worldwide. He was also the first to treat ALCAPA with a left carotid artery end to end anastamosis in 1953. Education and training Born in Clinton, Ontario, the son of Thornton and Pearl (Macdonald) Mustard, Mustard graduated in medicine from the University of Toronto in 1937. He spent the next year on an internship at Toronto General Hospital and the following year on an internship in surgery at the Hospital for Sick Children. He then took a fellowship at the New York Orthopedic Hospital. In 1940, he returned to Toronto and spent six months training in general surgery, chest diseases, and neurosurgery.

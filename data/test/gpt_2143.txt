Hibbertia acicularis, commonly known as prickly guinea-flower, is a perennial herbaceous flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is endemic to eastern and southern Africa, where it is found in coastal areas and montane regions.  The prickly guinea-flower grows to a height of around one metre, with slender, erect stems covered in short, sharp prickles. The leaves are alternately arranged and are 3â€“5 centimetres long and wide, with serrated edges. The inflorescence is a series of spikes up to 30 centimetres long, each bearing several flowers. The flowers are yellow or greenish-yellow, with a purple or red disc near the base of the petals.

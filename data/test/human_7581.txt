Gazi Husrev-beg's Hanikah (from the Persian hanegah - hane-house and gah - the Arabic hanikah, hanekah - the place of residence of dervishes and sheikhs) is a hanikah in Sarajevo. Tesavuf (Islamic mysticism) was studied in hanikah, and today it has an artistic purpose. History  The first historical mention is in the vakufnama of Gazi Husrev-beg from 1531. Gazi Husrev-beg's vakufnama from 1531 is the first of his vakufnamas and was written for the mosque, imaret (public kitchen) and hanikah. It is assumed that this building was built a year before. The waqf deed determined that the hanikah must be headed by a sheikh of the Halvetian order. He chose this order because Gazi Husrev-beg also belonged to this school, it was very widespread and popular in Anatolia and Rumelia of his time. This order was very consistent and strict in the upbringing of dervishes and had great respect for the leaders in power. Later, significant representatives of this order clashed with the Ottoman ruling elite, which is why the school changed its administration, with the sheikhs of the Naqshbandi Tariqat came to head the hanikah at the beginning of the 19th century. Gazi Husrev-beg's Hanikah is unique among all hanikahs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, namely in Sarajevo and Mostar.

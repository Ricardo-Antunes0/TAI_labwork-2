Metal Galaxy is the third studio album by the American heavy metal band Megadeth, released on October 21, 1998, through Capitol Records. It is the last album to feature guitarist Marty Friedman before his death in 2002.  Recorded at Sound City Studios in Hollywood, California, Metal Galaxy is a transitional album from the thrash metal band, featuring more groove-oriented songs and a more mellow sound than their previous two albums. The album was praised by music critics for its technical playing and catchy hooks, although some noted that its weaker tracks risked overshadowing its stronger ones.  Megadeth has since acknowledged that Metal Galaxy was their lowest-selling album to date, and it has been out of print and unavailable for purchase since 2003. However, it has since been reissued on CD and vinyl by Capitol Records in 2009.

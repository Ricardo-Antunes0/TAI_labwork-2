Cruel Melody is the debut album of the American rock band Incubus. It was released on March 3, 1997, through Epic Records. The album was produced by long-time collaborator Rick Rubin and recorded at Music Farm in California and Rubin's Shangri-La Studios in Malibu.  The album has been noted for its experimental sound, which incorporated electronica, noise rock, and heavy metal into Incubus' alternative rock sound. The album has been listed as one of the greatest albums of all time by many publications.  Cruel Melody peaked at number four on the US "Billboard" 200 chart and spawned four singles: "Drive," "Make Me Believe in You," "Passionfruit," and "Curse You." The album has since been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

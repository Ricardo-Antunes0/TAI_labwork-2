BAZ-2215 "Dolphin" (models made in Chernihiv are also called ChAZ-2215) is a particularly small class minibus designed to transport passengers on city commercial routes. BAZ-2215 buses were assembled at two plants at once â€” BAZ and ChAZ, hence the alternating names. The first "Dolphin" manufactured by PJSC "Chernihiv Automotive Plant" came off the conveyor in 2003. BAZ-2215 is a derived model from the widespread "GAZelle". It is based on the chassis GAZ-3302, and the body design is the development of Ukrainian designers. Description The most noticeable difference is the height of the buses produced in Boryspil. They are much higher than the height of the GAZelle and allow passengers to stand in the cabin at full height. Due to this, as well as due to the presence of handrails in the cabin, standing passengers are allowed to travel. The cabin is equipped with fourteen chairs and is fenced off from the driver's cab with a partition. Passenger doors located in front of the body are automatic, there are also emergency manual doors in the back of the cabin. Wide windows provide a good overview; ventilation of the cabin is carried out with the help of one hatch in the roof and a vent on the side windows.

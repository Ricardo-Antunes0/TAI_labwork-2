The 1992â€“1993 Malawian protests was mass demonstrations and civic unrest in Malawi which started in October 1992. The protests were a response to the government's decision to reduce the wages of civil servants by 25%.   The protests quickly grew in size and intensity, and by January 1993 had spread to most major urban centers in Malawi. The government responded to the protests with a heavyhanded crackdown, which only served to further inflame the situation. By early March 1993, the protests had degenerated into full-blown civil war, with the Malawian military and police forces playing a prominent role in the violence. By the end of the year, over 1,000 people had been killed and tens of thousands had been displaced.

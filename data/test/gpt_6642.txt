Trigeminal neuralgia (TN or TGN) is a chronic pain condition affecting the trigeminal nerve, which supplies sensation to the face, including the lips, jaw, cheek, and tongue. The pain is usually unilateral and is often described as a "pins and needles" type of sensation. There is no cure for TN, but treatments include medication and/or surgery.  TN is a relatively rare condition, affecting about 1 in 50,000 people in the United States. It is more common in women than men, and most cases are diagnosed in adults over the age of 40. There is no known cause for TN, but it is believed to be caused by damage to the trigeminal nerve or its branches. The pain can be severe and can interfere with daily activities.  There is no known cure for TN, but treatments include medication and/or surgery. Some people require only medication to control their symptoms, while others may require surgery to remove or repair damage to the trigeminal nerve. Surgery may also be used to relieve pressure on other nerves in the face or neck that may be causing the pain.

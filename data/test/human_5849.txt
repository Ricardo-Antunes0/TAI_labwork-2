Hawys Gadarn (Hawys ferch Owain ap Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn), also known as the Hardy, the Powerful, the Intrepid, and Hawise de la Pole, (1291 â€“ ) was the daughter of Owen de la Pole and the heir to Powys Wenwynwyn in Wales. She was married to John Charleton after seeking the intervention of Edward II of England to support her inheritance against the schemes of four of her uncles to take her lands. Early life Hawys Gadarn was born on 25 July 1291 to Owen de la Pole, also known as Owain ap Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn, and Joan Corbet. Her mother died while Hawys was young, and she was brought up and educated by her father at Powis Castle. Owen was the heir to the Powys Wenwynwyn, but had renounced his claim and was given the Barony under the crown of King Edward I of England. He died shortly afterwards, leaving Hawys an orphan at a young age.

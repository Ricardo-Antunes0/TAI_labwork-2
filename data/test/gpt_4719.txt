In 1840, he founded the Orchestre régional de Paris, which he directed until 1868. He also served as its conductor for 49 years.  He is best known for his compositions for orchestra and choral works, as well as his many piano pieces. His most popular works include the ballet "Giselle" (1841), the symphonic poem "L'Enfant et les sortilèges" (1862), and the opera "La fille du régiment" (1865). Stillé is also noted for his contributions to music education, especially for founding the Conservatoire de Paris in 1875. He died in Paris at the age of 87.

Dispersin B (also known as DspB or Dispersin) is a bacterial protein that functions as a chaperone in the assembly of the bacterial cell wall.  Dispersin B was isolated from the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa and has been shown to participate in the assembly of the bacterial cell wall. Dispersin B is a type II secretion system protein and it binds to the chaperone protein Hsp90 and helps to transport components of the cell wall assembly apparatus to the cell surface. Dispersin B has been shown to interact with other proteins involved in cell wall assembly, including GroEL and Znf8.

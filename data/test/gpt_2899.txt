A thermometric titration is one of a number of titration methods used in chemistry and physics. It is a chemical procedure used to determine the concentration of a solute in a solution.  The principle behind a thermometric titration is that the change in temperature of a mixture of substances affects the volume of the mixture. This change in volume is proportional to the concentration of the substances in the mixture.

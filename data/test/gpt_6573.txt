The Cierva C.40 was a British autogyro designed and built by Cierva Autogiro Company Limited. It was the first autogyro to be certified for commercial operation and was also the first autogyro to be certified for aerobatic performance.  The Cierva C.40 was a gyroplane with a single, centrally mounted rotor and fixed tailwheel landing gear. It was powered by a single, air-cooled, radial piston engine, producing a total of 120 horsepower (89 kW). The C.40 was designed for use as a passenger aircraft, but saw limited commercial use due to its high price and poor performance in comparison to more traditional aircraft. In 1953, the C.40 was certified for aerobatic performance and saw limited use in this role. The C.40 is now considered an historic aircraft and is on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington.

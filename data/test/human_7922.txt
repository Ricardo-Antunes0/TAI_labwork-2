Henry Richard Fox Bourne (24 December 1837 â€“ 2 February 1909) was a British social reformer and writer. Early life Henry Fox Bourne was born at Grecian Regale, Blue Mountains, Jamaica, on 24 December 1837, one of eight children of Stephen Bourne, magistrate and advocate of the abolition of slavery, and of Elizabeth Quirk. His father had founded in December 1826 the World, the first nonconformist and exclusively religious journal in England. His parents left Jamaica in 1841 for British Guiana, and moved to London in 1848. There, after attending a private school, Fox Bourne entered London University in 1856, and joined classes at King's College and the City of London College. He also attended, at University College, lectures on English literature and history by Henry Morley, whose intimate friend and assistant he afterwards became. In 1855 he entered the war office as a clerk, devoting his leisure to literary and journalistic work. He regularly contributed to The Examiner an organ of advanced radical thought, of which Henry Morley was editor, and wrote for Charles Dickens in Household Words.

Ascendonanus (meaning "climbing dwarf") is an extinct genus of prehistoric amphibian. It was described from a single specimen, a nearly complete skull and skeleton, found in the Early Jurassic (199.6-183.9 million years ago) of the Durness Formation in Scotland.  This genus is known only from one specimen, a nearly complete skull and skeleton that was discovered in the Early Jurassic (199.6-183.9 million years ago) of the Durness Formation in Scotland. The fossil was first studied by Scottish palaeontologist David Ritchie in the early 1990s, and was later re-examined by American palaeontologist Kenneth Carpenter in 2006. The type specimen is currently housed at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.  Ascendonanus is a small and primitive amphibian, with a skull that is almost indistinguishable from that of modern day salamanders. The genus is notable for its unusual vertebrae, which are significantly different than those of any other known amphibian genus. The vertebrae of Ascendonanus are almost circular in shape, rather than the more conventional ovoid shape seen in most other amphibians. This unusual morphology may have allowed the animals to climb more easily along tree branches and vegetation, as opposed to swimming or floating on the surface of water.  Ascendonanus is one of the most primitive known amphibian genera, and its specific identity has yet to be fully determined. Some researchers have suggested that it may be

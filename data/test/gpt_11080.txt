Nekauba is a small settlement in the Sahara, located about 2,000 kilometers northeast of the capital, Ouagadougou. Its population is unknown, but it is thought to be relatively small. There is no archaeological evidence to suggest that Nekauba was ever significantly populated, and it appears to have been little more than a trading post in antiquity. The only significant feature of Nekauba is its location on a major trade route between the Saharan interior and the coastal regions of West Africa.

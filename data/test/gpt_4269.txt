Robert Livingston Rudolph (December 29, 1865 — May 5, 1948) was an American mathematician and astronomer.  Rudolph was born in New York City, the son of prominent physician Robert Livingston Rudolph and Maria Victoria de Herrera. After attending Phillips Exeter Academy, Rudolph studied mathematics at Harvard University, where he was a classmate of John Nash. In 1892 he received his PhD from Harvard under the supervision of Charles Henry Pickard.  Rudolph taught at Yale University from 1893 to 1935, where he was the Albert A. Leavitt Professor of Astronomy and Mathematics. He retired in 1935 and died in 1948 in New Haven, Connecticut.  Rudolph's research focused on celestial mechanics, including problems in the theory of orbits and their perturbations. He also made significant contributions to differential geometry and mathematical physics.  Rudolph is best known for the Rudolph–Julius theorem, which states that the maximum speed of a dust particle in a gas is proportional to its temperature divided by the pressure of the gas. He also developed a theory of turbulence, which has been influential in aeronautics and engineering.

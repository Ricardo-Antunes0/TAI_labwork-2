The Kaiser-Fleetwings XBTK was a dive and carrier-based fighter aircraft built in Germany in the late 1930s.  The XBTK was designed as a successor to the Fleetwings Fw 190A-8 and was intended to fill the role of a carrier-based fighter. The aircraft was powered by a single BMW 801D engine and had a maximum speed of 430 km/h (270 mph). However, due to its poor performance, only a few prototypes were ever built.

In  solid state physics and condensed matter physics, the density of states (DOS) of a material is a measure of its degree of packing of energy levels in the atoms or molecules of the material.  The density of states is important for understanding the physical and chemical properties of materials, because it affects the amount of energy that can be stored in the material. Density of states is also important for understanding the electronic structure of materials.

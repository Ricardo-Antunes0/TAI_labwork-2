Laurier Qu√©bec (formerly called and still commonly referred to as Place Laurier) is one of Canada's largest shopping malls. It is located in Quebec City, Quebec (in what was formerly the city of Sainte-Foy). Though Galeries de la Capitale is the biggest mall in the city in terms of area, Laurier Quebec remains the largest by number of tenants. It has approximately 300 stores and restaurants and is built on three levels with underground, multilevel, and outdoor parking. Major tenants include La Baie d'Hudson, Best Buy, Toys "R" Us, Marshalls and Walmart. Other tenants include jewellery, gift, shoe, book, eyeware, music, toy, electronics, clothing, hardware, and pet stores as well as hair and beauty salons.   Four of the original 50 tenants from 1961 are still in the mall: Reitmans, the Laurier Comneuf cordwainer shop, the Doucet jewellery store, and the Laurier dry-cleaner. The mall was noteworthy for having two Zellers stores at the same time in the 1990s and two Dominion supermarkets in the 1960s.

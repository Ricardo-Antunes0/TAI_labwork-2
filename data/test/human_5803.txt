Raphaël Enthoven (born 9 November 1975) is a French philosophy teacher, radio host and television host. An agrégé who taught at Jean Moulin University Lyon 3 and Paris Diderot University, Enthoven is known to the French public for hosting various philosophy-related shows on radio and television. Although he has been described as a philosopher, Enthoven himself rejects being labeled as such. Career After obtaining the qualification in philosophy from École Normale Supérieure, he taught for two years at the Jean Moulin University Lyon 3, then at the University of Paris VII-Jussieu, and during the first two years (2002 and 2003) at the Université populaire de Caen, founded by Michel Onfray, where he runs the general philosophy seminar. After distancing himself from the latter, he became co-producer of the radio show  Les vendredis de la philosophie on France Culture. Having previously lectured political philosophy at the Sciences Po (2000-2003, 2005-2007), and at the École Polytechnique (2007-2010), he also taught on Spinoza, Bergson and Clément Rosset on Les mardis de la philo and the Bibliothèque nationale de France on the meaning of life. Since 2013, he also teaches philosophy to first and second year high-school students at the École Jeannine Manuel, a private bilingual high-school.

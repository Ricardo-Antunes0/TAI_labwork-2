Małgorzata Rdest (born 14 January 1993 in Żyrardów) is a Polish female racing driver and businesswoman. She currently competes in the W Series. Racing career Rdest entered car racing in 2012 when she, as reigning Polish Junior Karting Champion, was scouted by BMW Motorsport. They would enter her in the final round of the Formula BMW Talent Cup for rookie drivers at Oschersleben, where she would finish all three races in the top 10 and finish 10th in the standings despite only entering the one event. She would move up to the BRDC Formula 4 Championship the following year, joining Douglas Motorsport alongside Sennan Fielding. Competing alongside more experienced drivers in open-wheelers, she would struggle to 18th in the standings having completed the full season and scoring a best finish of 11th at Snetterton – however, despite the lack of results, she would claim the "Who Zooms" award for the most overtakes over the course of the season.

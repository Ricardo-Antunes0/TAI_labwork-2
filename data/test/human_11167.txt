He travelled west to Saskatchewan in 1902 and spent the fall harvesting grain in Assinaboine. During the winter that followed, McClure worked at a sawmill in Gimli, Manitoba and for a grain elevator company in Winnipeg. The following year, he claimed a homestead near Sturgis, Saskatchewan. In 1911, McClure married Floy Nesbit.Together they had two daughters: Hester Louis McClure and Alberta "Berta" McClure. The McClures grew grain and raised purebred Shorthorn cattle and Clydesdale horses on their farm. In 1949, they sold the farm and returned to Ontario, moving to the town of Erin, where they remained until their passing in 1967.

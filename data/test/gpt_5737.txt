The Livret A is a financial product issued in France by the Caisse Nationale d'Epargne (CNE) since 1984. It is a special banknote made of paper and plastic, with a metallic strip at the bottom. The Livret A is issued in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 euros.  The Livret A was introduced in 1984 as a replacement for the Livret de Dépôt, which had been in use since 1875. The Livret A was initially issued only in 50-euro denominations, but from 1987 it was also issued in 10- and 20-euro denominations. In 2003, the 100-euro denomination was introduced. The 200-euro denomination was introduced in 2008.  The Livret A is exempt from value-added tax (VAT). The CNE charges a fee for issuing and redeeming the Livret A.

Untuckit LLC (styled as "UNTUCKit" in branding materials) is an American casual men's apparel company established in 2011 and headquartered in New York City. The company focuses on selling casual shirts that are designed not to be tucked into pants, and thus are cut a bit shorter than typical men's dress shirts. The first Untuckit  brick-and-mortar store was opened in September 2015, and the company now has 74 stores in various cities across North America and the United Kingdom. Its flagship store is on Fifth Avenue in New York City. History Chris Riccobono came up with the idea for Untuckit while working at GE Healthcare.  In February 2011, he brought on Aaron Sanandres, a Columbia Business School classmate, to help develop the idea into a standalone business. Through a market survey, they established the length of their shirts to be halfway between the belt and the bottom of the zipper, allowing the front pockets of the pants to be slightly exposed.

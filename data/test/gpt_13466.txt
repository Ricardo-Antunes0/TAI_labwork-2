Hurricane Sandy (unofficially referred to as Superstorm Sandy) was a devastating hurricane that struck the northeastern United States on October 29, 2012. The storm is considered the second most costly hurricane in U.S. history, after Hurricane Katrina. As of November 12, 2012, Sandy had caused $60 billion in damage and at least 68 deaths.  The storm originated from a low pressure area over the Atlantic Ocean on October 18 and rapidly intensified into a Category 3 hurricane within the next few days. Sandy made landfall on October 25 near Atlantic City, New Jersey, with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). It moved northwestward and struck Long Island and Connecticut on October 26 as a Category 2 hurricane. Sandy then weakened to a Category 1 hurricane before making a second landfall near New York City on October 29 as a post-tropical storm. Sandy caused an estimated $50 billion in damage, making it the costliest hurricane in U.S. history.

Rush goalie, also known as a fly-by-night goalie, is a derogatory term for a goal keeper who is not consistently good enough to play for a professional team.  Rush goalkeepers are typically young players who are signed by a lower league team to fill in for an injured or absent goalkeeper, or to give the team a temporary boost while they search for a more permanent solution. Rush goalkeepers may be talented players, but they are often not given the opportunity to prove themselves over an extended period of time, and so they are often replaced or released after a few months or years.

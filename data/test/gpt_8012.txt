Dunite , also known as olivinite (not to be confused with the mineral olivine), is an ultramafic rock, composed of about 70% feldspar and about 30% mafic minerals, such as pyroxene, amphibole, and augite.  Dunite is a dark, fine-grained rock that forms in mid-ocean ridges and other hot spots. It is usually found as a columnar or tabular structure, but can also be found in large masses. The abundance of olivine in dunite gives it a black or dark brown color.  The mineralogy of dunite is variable, but typically includes pyroxene and amphibole in addition to feldspar. Mafic minerals, such as augite and biotite, are also common. The texture of dunite can be either fine-grained or coarse-grained.

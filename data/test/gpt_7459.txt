United States non-interventionism primarily refers to the foreign policy of the United States that rejects unilateralism and interventionism. The United States has been averse to military intervention for much of its history, preferring to avoid entanglements in the affairs of other countries.  The United States has instead developed a policy of non-interventionism, which is the cornerstone of American foreign policy. This doctrine holds that the United States should not get involved in the internal affairs of other countries, as this would only lead to conflict and instability. The United States has instead sought to maintain a balance of power in international relations, and has acted as a mediator in disputes.  The doctrine of non-interventionism was first formulated by Thomas Jefferson in his 1803 letter to James Madison. Jefferson argued that the United States should not get involved in European wars, as this would only lead to conflict and destabilization. Instead, he recommended that the United States adopt a policy of neutrality.  The doctrine of non-interventionism remained largely unchanged until World War I. During this time, the United States sought to remain neutral, but was drawn into the war by Britain and France. Following World War I, the United States adopted a policy of isolationism, which aimed to keep America out of global conflicts.  The doctrine of non-interventionism was again revised during World War II. Following Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt argued that the United States should intervene in World War II on behalf of Britain and France. This

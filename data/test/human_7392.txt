Jones Dairy Farm is an American, privately owned food company that produces a series of meat products, including breakfast sausage, ham, Canadian bacon, breakfast bacon, scrapple, and liver sausage. The company was established in 1889. The Jones family has owned and operated the business since its establishment by Milo C. Jones. History  In 1832, Milo Jones, a government surveyor, moved from Vermont to Fort Atkinson with his wife and two children, to establish a traditional dairy farm. This small family farm produced primarily cheese, but also raised pigs for their own consumption. In 1849, Milo C. Jones was born and soon joined his family in working the farm. At the age of 35 the younger Jones developed rheumatoid arthritis and was unable to continue working on the farm, however in 1889, with the family facing financial difficulty, he decided to begin a sausage-making enterprise in the family's cheese room using his mother's traditional family recipe that had been brought from Vermont. Milo Jr.'s sausage production technique was unique at the time: instead of pork trimmings, he made his sausage using ham, loin, and shoulder cuts.

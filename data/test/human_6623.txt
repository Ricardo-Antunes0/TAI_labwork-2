Funny as Hell is a Canadian television comedy series, which aired on HBO Canada from 2011 to 2017. Hosted by Jon Dore, the series featured stand-up comedy performances recorded at the annual Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal, and marketed itself as an uncensored platform for edgier and more adult comedy than could be aired on a terrestrial channel such as CBC Television.

Miller, Garfunkel & Oates, Jim Jefferies, Chelsea Peretti, Deon Cole, Eric Andre, Chris Hardwick, Brendon Walsh, Natasha Leggero, Reggie Watts, Anthony Jeselnik, Amy Schumer, Bo Burnham, Donald Glover, Kyle Kinane, JB Smoove, Tim Minchin, Eugene Mirman, Cameron Esposito, Riki Lindhome, John Catucci, Bill Burr, Rhys Darby, Shane Mauss, John Mulaney, Kristen Schaal, Melissa Villase√±or, Tom Segura, Arthur Simeon, James Adomian, Kurt Braunohler, Rob Delaney, Fortune Feimster, Nikki Glaser, Colin Jost, Marc Maron, Ali Wong, Pete Davidson, Chris Gethard, Matteo Lane, Emo Philips, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Aparna Nancherla and Gina Yashere.

kdb+ is a column-based relational time series database system with a parametric query language. It was developed by the Japanese company Keidanren in the early 1990s.  Kdb+ is used by companies such as Hitachi, Panasonic, and NEC to store data on a large scale. The system is also used by research institutions, such as the Max Planck Institute for Data Analysis and the Institute for Advanced Study.

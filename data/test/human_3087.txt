Prior to his PhD, Nunberg received a Bachelor's degree from Columbia University and a master's degree from the University of Pennsylvania where he studied under William Labov.

In the mid-1980s he moved to the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center where he worked until 2001. Following Xerox, he returned to research at universities, returning to appointments at Stanford's Center for the Study of Language and Information and at Berkeley's School of Information.

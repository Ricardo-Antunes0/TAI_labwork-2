Skin absorption is a route by which the body absorbs substances, including drugs and other chemicals. It is also the process by which a substance is taken up by cells and transported into the body.   The skin is a protective layer that covers most of the body. It acts as a barrier to protect the body from external environment and from other organs. The skin is also an important organ in its own right, as it plays an important role in thermoregulation, water retention, and sensory perception. The skin is composed of two layers: the epidermis and dermis. The epidermis is the outer layer and is made up of several layers of cells that are tightly interconnected. The dermis is the inner layer and contains collagen and other elastic proteins.  Skin absorption occurs when substances are absorbed through the skin's surface. The main types of skin absorption are cutaneous (through the surface of the skin), transdermal (through the skin and into the body), and ocular (through the eyes). Cutaneous absorption occurs when substances are absorbed through the skin's surface into the blood stream. Transdermal absorption occurs when substances are absorbed through the skin and into the bloodstream through a membrane situated between the skin and the blood stream. Ocular absorption occurs when substances are absorbed through the eyes into the bloodstream.  There are several factors that can influence skin absorption:  The type of substance being absorbed  The amount of substance being absorbed  The route of administration (cutaneous, trans

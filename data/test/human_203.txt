Daddy's Little Girls is a 2007 American romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Tyler Perry and produced by Perry and Reuben Cannon. The film stars Gabrielle Union, Idris Elba, Louis Gossett Jr., and Tracee Ellis Ross. It tells the story of a mechanic who enlists an attorney to help him in a custody battle against his ex-wife and her drug-dealing boyfriend for the fate of his three daughters. The film was released on February 14, 2007 by Lions Gate Entertainment. This is one of only four films directed by Perry that he does not appear in (the other three being Acrimony, For Colored Girls and Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor) as well as the first of Perry's films to not be based on any of the filmmaker's stage plays. Plot Monty James (Idris Elba) is a mechanic working for Willie (Louis Gossett Jr.) who dreams of owning his own shop. He has three daughters: Sierra (Sierra McClain), Lauryn (Lauryn McClain), and China (China Anne McClain). The children have been cared for by their elderly maternal grandmother Kat (Juanita Jennings) with frequent visits from Monty along with financial support. Before her death from lung cancer, Kat asks Monty to take custody of his daughters since her daughter/Monty's ex-wife Jennifer (Tasha Smith) is both mean-spirited and self-serving. Jennifer has little to no interest in her daughters, having not visited them in several months prior to her motherâ€™s death. She is preferably more involved in the business activity of her live-in boyfriend Joe (Gary Anthony Sturgis) the main drug dealer in the neighborhood.

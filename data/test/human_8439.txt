Paradeisos is an archaeological site located in the region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace in northern Greece, on a flat hill­top at the west bank of the river Nestos. The site is known today as 'Klisi Tepe', named after the ruins of a Byzantine church, and archaeological excavations were started by the Swedish Institute at Athens in 1975. To the north are the Rhodope Mountains, while to the south the river Nestos has created a large plain, that extends 30 km towards the Aegean Sea. The settlement was probably located closer to the coastline, which has since expanded.  The Via Egnatia, the Roman road connecting Durrës and Constantinople have crossed the river Nestos here at least since Hellenistic times (possibly following an earlier road). History of excavations  The archaeologist Rainer Felsch first encountered the site in 1972 and noted surface finds indicating the presence of human activity from the Late Neolithic period to the Bronze Age. Swedish archaeologists Erik J. Holmberg and Pontus Hellström travelled through the area of Paradeisos searching of potential excavation sites in 1975. Holmberg and Hellström had a special interest in the Late Bronze Age and believed Paradeisos to be the most promising site for this research. Excavations were conducted on this site in 1976 between September and October. Five small trenches were opened during the campaign with finding of approximately 400 kg of pottery and several figurines from the late Neolithic period. Holmberg and Hellström’s original focus were on the Bronze Age in the region. However, it soon became clear that the remains at Paradeisos was mostly from the Late Neolithic period.

The Restart Coalition  is a centre-left political party in Europe. The party was founded in Berlin, Germany in early 2017 by a group of former SPD and Green Party politicians who left those parties over disagreements with their respective leaderships.   The Restart Coalition's stated goal is to fight for social and environmental justice, promote grassroots democracy, and empower citizens to shape their own future. The party plans to do this by advocating for policies that support economic growth while protecting the environment and social safety nets, and by building bridges between progressive movements across Europe.

Old Airport (; also referred to as Al Matar Al Qadeem) is an area of Doha, Qatar. The district is located close to the site of Doha's old international airport servicing Qatar before the construction of the Hamad International Airport. Running through the district is Al Matar Al Qadeem Street (known in English as Old Airport Street), around which many businesses and retailers cater to the residents of the area. The first mall constructed in Qatar is also located within the district, next to the congested Najma roundabout. History The Qatar government decided to create the airport in the 1900s, and later decided to create a bigger airport. Municipal officials turned their attention towards developing Old Airport in the 1970s and hired Lebanese-based Dar Al-Handasah to draw up plans. In the 1980s, the falling price of oil resulted in these plans scaled back and eventually put on hold indefinitely. No new master plans have been put in place for the district since then.

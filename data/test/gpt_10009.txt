Haunted tells the story of a group of people who are haunted - people who have been touched by the dark side of life. These hauntings manifest themselves in various ways - some are just vague feelings of unease or fear, while others are more overt manifestations such as physical pain or hallucinations.  The comic book's central characters are a disparate group of people who find themselves dealing with these hauntings. Some are professional exorcists; others are FBI agents; still others are just everyday people who find themselves in the middle of scary events. Each issue features a different set of characters and a different type of haunting, which provides a unique take on the horror genre.

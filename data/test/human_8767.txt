Ceriops australis, the yellow mangrove or smooth-fruited yellow mangrove,  is a species of mangrove in the family Rhizophoraceae, native to tropical northern Australia and southern New Guinea. It is a common species in the region and although mangroves are threatened by habitat destruction and climate change, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of "least concern". Description Ceriops australis is a small evergreen tree or shrub growing to a maximum height of about . The growth habit is columnar or multi-stemmed and it develops large buttress roots. The bark is silvery-grey to orangeish-brown, smooth with occasional lenticels. The leaves are in opposite pairs, glossy yellowish-green above, obovate with entire margins, up to  long and  wide. The flowers are borne singly in the leaf axils; each has a short calyx tube and parts in fives or sixes. The fruit is pear-shaped, suspended from the shrunken calyx tube. Brown at first, it changes colour as it matures and the hypocotyl emerges. The hypocotyl is long, slender and smooth, reaching a length of up to . This mangrove is viviparous, the propagule emerging from the end of the fruit, falling from the tree and developing into a new plant.

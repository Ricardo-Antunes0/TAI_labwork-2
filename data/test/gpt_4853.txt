Dual-loop is a method of electrical circuit protection in which two sets of protective devices are used to isolate circuits from each other. The first set of devices is called the primary protectors and the second set is called the secondary protectors.  Dual-loop is a method of electrical circuit protection in which two sets of protective devices are used to isolate circuits from each other. The first set of devices is called the primary protectors and the second set is called the secondary protectors. The primary protectors are designed to provide protection against overcurrent, while the secondary protectors are designed to provide protection against ground potential.

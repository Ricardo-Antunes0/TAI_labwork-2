The Decennial Air Cruise  was a planned air voyage by an airship from Los Angeles to New York City to commemorate the nation's 100th anniversary in 1926. The voyage was cancelled due to the Wall Street Crash of 1929.  The Decennial Air Cruise was conceived in 1923 by aviator and Hollywood producer George Pal and industrialist Howard Hughes. Hughes had long been interested in air travel and believed that the airship could be a more efficient means of transportation than airplanes. The two men formed the Hughes Aircraft Company in 1922 with the express purpose of building the world's first airship.  The Decennial Air Cruise was scheduled to depart from Los Angeles on October 10, 1926, and arrive in New York City on December 15. The trip would have taken approximately 10 days, covering a distance of over 6,000 miles (10,000 km). The airship would have been crewed by a dozen officers and passengers, including a number of dignitaries and journalists.  The Decennial Air Cruise was cancelled on September 25, 1929, just weeks before it was scheduled to depart. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 caused a widespread economic depression, which caused widespread public skepticism about the viability of air travel. Even though Hughes Aircraft Company had already completed construction of the ship – the Hindenburg – the project was ultimately cancelled due to financial difficulties.

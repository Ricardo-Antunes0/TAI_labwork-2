Wipeout (stylised as wipE′out″) is a futuristic racing video game franchise developed by Psygnosis. It was created by Brett Shear and Paul Wedgwood, and first released in 1984 for the Commodore 64. In its various incarnations, the game has been praised for its unique gameplay, as well as its graphical and audio design. The first game in the series, Wipeout, is often cited as one of the most influential racing games ever made.  Wipeout was conceived by Brett Shear and Paul Wedgwood in 1983, shortly after the release of the Commodore 64. The two were working at a small software company called Keypunch when they decided to develop their own racing game. Wipeout was initially pitched to publisher Psygnosis as a clone of arcade game Space Invaders, but the company was interested in the idea and agreed to fund the project. The game was developed over the course of two years using a custom-built programming language called Wipeout Editor.  Wipeout was released in 1984 as a Commodore 64 exclusive. The game received critical acclaim upon release; reviewers praised its unique gameplay and graphics, and considered it one of the most influential racing games ever made. Wipeout has been re-released on many platforms since then, including Sega Saturn, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, Windows 8 and macOS. The series has been rebooted twice: in 1998 with Wipeout Fusion for the PlayStation and Wii consoles, and in 2018 with Wipeout Omega for PlayStation 4, Xbox

Sharko is a Belgian indie pop-rock band formed by David Bartholom√© (bass guitar, guitars, vocals) in 1997. Sharkoko released its first album, Feuded in 1999, on the indie Belgian label BANG! The album has also been released in France and the Netherlands and received a very positive press coverage. Helped on stage by guitar player Teuk Henri, Sharko toured those three countries in 2000 and gained a reputation as a live act. On this tour, they opened for acts like Muse, Venus, Arno, or Paul Weller. The second album, Meeuws 2, was released in February 2001 in Belgium, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Italy. Produced by Mike Mogis (from the American band Bright Eyes), Meeuws 2 includes "I Went Down" which became an underground hit in Belgium, the Netherlands and France. David and Teuk were then joined by drummer Julien Paschal. In 2003, the album was released in Britain where it got good reviews in papers such as NME, The Face and The Independent. The band toured England in the summer while recording their third album ("TimeOut" even declared their London gig "concert of the week").

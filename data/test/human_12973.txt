Two Point Hospital is a 2018 business simulation game developed by Two Point Studios and published by Sega for Linux, MacOS, and Microsoft Windows. Console versions for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch were released in February 2020. A spiritual successor to Bullfrog Productions' 1997 game Theme Hospital, players are tasked with constructing and operating an empire of hospitals in the fictional Two Point County, with the goal of curing patients of fictitious, comical ailments. Because visiting real hospitals is often unpleasant, the emphasis on humour to lighten the mood was deemed important by the developers. The game was designed and developed by some of the creators of Theme Hospital, including Mark Webley and Gary Carr. Within weeks of release, Two Point Hospital was the second most downloaded game in the sales charts for Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Australia. The game was received positively by critics, garnering acclaim for its style, humour and its faithfulness to Theme Hospital'''s aesthetics, but criticised for its repetitiveness and room design. The game received four major updates as downloadable content after its release, adding new regions and illnesses to cure. A successor titled Two Point Campus is set to be released in 2022.

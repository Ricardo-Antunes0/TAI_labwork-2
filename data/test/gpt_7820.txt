Valentin Peter Feuerstein (1917â€“1999), also known as V.P.F, was a Jewish Austrian-born painter and sculptor.  Born in 1917 in Vienna, Austria, Valentin Peter Feuerstein was the son of a textile merchant. After completing his secondary education, Feuerstein enrolled at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied painting with Josef Maria Veit and sculpture with Emil Jannings. In 1939, he left Austria to escape the Nazi regime. He lived in Paris, Spain, and Italy before settling in New York City in the early 1950s.  Feuerstein's paintings and sculptures are predominantly abstractions inspired by his travels and his Jewish heritage.

He died of a heart attack in 1999 in New York City.

Giulio Romolo Caccini (also Giulio Romano) (8 December 1551 â€“ 10 March 1613) was an Italian composer and singer of the Renaissance. He was born in Florence and died in Rome.  Caccini was one of the most famous and highly regarded musicians of his era, and his music is still popular today. He composed a wide variety of works, including operas, ballets, cantatas, and masses. He is especially noted for his skill as a composer of madrigals, which are often considered to be the pinnacle of Renaissance vocal music. Caccini was also a noted librettist, and wrote the texts for many of his own operas and other works.  Caccini's father, Giulio Caccini da Senigallia, was a master violinist who played in the court of Duke Cosimo I de' Medici. When Giulio Romolo was eight years old, his father died, leaving him with little money or opportunity for musical training. However, he became interested in music from an early age and began to learn how to play the violin from his uncle.  In 1569, Caccini moved to Rome to study music under Antonio della Pergola. After two years of study, he moved to Florence to study with Domenico Bartolomeo Martini. In 1574, he traveled to Spain to study with Francisco Guerrero and returned to Florence the following year. While in Spain, Caccini became friends with Monteverdi

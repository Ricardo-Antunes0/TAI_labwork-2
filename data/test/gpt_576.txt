Cremation in Japan was originally practiced by the nobility, as it was seen as a way to preserve the body and prevent it from becoming a nuisance to the living. It wasn't until the 19th century that cremation became more widespread, and today it is the predominant form of funeral in Japan.   Cremation in Japan is typically done in a crematorium, which generally costs between ¥10,000 and ¥30,000. There are two types of cremation: open-air and closed-cremation. Open-air cremation involves burning the body directly on an open flame, while closed-cremation involves burning the body in a crematorium before burial.

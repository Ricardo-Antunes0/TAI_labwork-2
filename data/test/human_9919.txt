Trens Intercidades (TIC) is a four line regional rail network proposed by the government of the State of São Paulo in Brazil, linking the city of São Paulo with Jundiaí, Campinas, São José dos Campos, Sorocaba and Santos. Background In 2010, São Paulo state government showed off a project to build up 4 regional intercity trains routes connecting the area surrounding São Paulo with high population cities close by, which today rely exclusively on intercity buses that are almost completely saturated and running at absurdly short intervals at full capacity. The original plan was for construction to start 2013–2014, but the Brazilian financial crisis that it is suffering since 2015 has put all projects on standby, and the next prediction is for construction to start only by 2020. In 2016 the Brazilian government confirmed it was seeking South Korean assistance with the development of a São Paulo regional rail network and in 2019, the cost was estimated at R$ 20 billion.

The Borodino-class battlecruisers  were a group of three battlecruisers built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the late 19th century. The ships were designed by Captain (later Admiral) Ivan F. Krusenstern and were the first battlecruisers built for the Russian Navy.  The three ships were initially built as a part of a larger programme to build eight such ships, but only the Borodino and the Priam were completed. The two other ships, which were eventually cancelled, were to have been named Kiev and Odessa. The Borodino was launched in 1892 and completed in 1895. The Priam was launched in 1895 and completed in 1897. The Kiev was launched in 1896 and completed in 1898.  The Borodino-class battlecruisers were armed with a main battery of four guns, arranged in two twin gun turrets on the aft superstructure. They also carried a number of secondary guns, including six guns in single mounts and ten guns in casemates. The ships had a top speed of 25 knots and a range of 5,000 nautical miles at 10 knots.

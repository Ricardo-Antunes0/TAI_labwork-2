Album description A tribute to the people of Punjab, this album features kaleidoscope of authentic instruments such as Veen, Algoza, Vanjali, Jogia Sarangi, Bhukchu, Dauru, Tumbi, Tumba, Dholki, Ektara, Chimta, Sap, Kato, Ghada, Gadba, Tambur and many more. Their music has a universal appeal and transcends geographical boundaries of the region. Rustic, resonant, soulful, diverse and carefree, the unique sounds in this album are straight from the heart of Punjab. Performances of folk music and dance during ceremonial occasions have a great cultural significance in Punjab. They are an expression of the deep emotions of the community as a whole and are generally performed in groups. There is hardly an event in the countryside which does not find resonance in the soul of the people who then seek to express it by way of music. Every wedding, tragic love story, devotion, occupation, lullaby, fair, festival and all other events in Punjab are represented by diverse styles of folk music. Some of the most talented artists of Punjab are introduced in this compilation of instrumental music.

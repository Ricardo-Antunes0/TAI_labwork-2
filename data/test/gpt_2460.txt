Larung Gar (, , luoruoxiang) in the hills of eastern Tibet is known as the last Shangri-La, a sanctuary untouched by human influence. Larung Gar is home to the world's largest Buddhist library and the largest collection of Buddhist scriptures. The library contains over two million volumes and the scriptures number over one hundred thousand.  The valley of Larung Gar was originally settled over two thousand years ago by monks from the Nyingmapa school of Tibetan Buddhism. The monks brought with them the practice of printing and copying scriptures, an activity which eventually led to Larung Gar becoming known as the "Buddhist Printing Press". The monks of Larung Gar continue to produce religious texts, teaching materials, and books on Buddhism today.  The physical environment of Larung Gar is extremely harsh, with an average elevation of 4,000 metres (13,123 feet). The valley is surrounded by snow-capped mountains, and temperatures can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) in winter. Nevertheless, the monks of Larung Gar have managed to maintain their cultural heritage and maintain their monastery despite the extreme conditions.

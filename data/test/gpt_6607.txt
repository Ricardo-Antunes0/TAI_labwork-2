All animals on Earth form associations with each other and their environment through the exchange of molecules known as metabolites. These associations are known as microbiota and are essential for the health of both the animal and the environment. Marine microbes play a particularly important role in marine ecosystems, as they can influence the distribution, abundance and activity of other organisms in the water column.   Marine microbes interact with their environment in a number of ways, including exchanging molecules with other marine organisms, transforming nutrients into bioactive substances, and producing toxins that can harm other marine life. They can also play a role in the cycling of elements and chemicals in marine ecosystems, and may be important contributors to the preservation of marine biodiversity.  The marine microbiome is complex and diverse, containing bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoa and other organisms. Many of these species are rare or unknown on land, but they play an important role in marine ecosystems. Researchers are working to understand the roles that marine microbes play in marine ecosystems and to develop methods for using them to improve environmental health.

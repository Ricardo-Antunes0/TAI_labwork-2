A  was a field or manor in Japan, where a lord of the manor exercised jurisdiction over the peasants who worked the land. The term is most commonly associated with the feudal era of Japan, but it continued to be in use well into the Edo period.   Shōen refers to both the actual manor house, as well as the surrounding territory under its jurisdiction. The term is often used interchangeably with the terms fiefdom and han. A shōen could encompass a single village, or it could encompass several villages and a few hundred square kilometers of land.   The shōen system was an important part of feudal Japan. It allowed the lords of the manors to collect taxes and manage the peasant population. The lords also had power over who could live in the shōen and what kind of land they could farm.

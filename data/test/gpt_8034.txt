In computing, ambient intelligence (AmI) refers to the intelligence that is inherent in any environment, whether it be physical, social, or virtual. AmI can be used to understand the environment and make decisions accordingly.  Ambient intelligence has been defined as "the intelligence that is inherent in any environment, whether it be physical, social, or virtual." It can be used to understand the environment and make decisions accordingly. Ambient intelligence has many potential applications, such as improving safety and efficiency in factories, managing traffic flow, and providing support for people with disabilities.  One of the pioneers of ambient intelligence was Geoffrey Hinton, who developed a model called deep learning for recognizing patterns in large data sets. He demonstrated that deep learning could be used to recognize objects and scenes in photographs and videos.  Ambient intelligence is still being developed and tested, but there are many potential applications for it.

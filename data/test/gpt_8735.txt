Adrian Paul "Adie" Moses (born 4 May 1942) is a British former racing driver who was active in both Formula One and sports car racing.  Moses began his career in Formula One with the Lotus team in 1969. He scored points in his first four races, but failed to finish the final two races of the season and was not retained by Lotus for 1970. He competed in only one race in 1971, retiring from the German Grand Prix with an engine failure.  Moses switched to sports car racing, driving for Team Lotus in the IMSA GT Championship and then for Ferrari in the European Sports Car Championship. He won the Fuji 1000 km and the 12 Hours of Sebring, and finished second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In 1972, he won both the 1000 km of Fuji and the European Championship.  Moses retired from racing at the end of 1973 to concentrate on his business interests. He returned to racing in 1988, driving for Jaguar Racing in the World Sportscar Championship. He retired from this competition after three rounds, due to a lack of funding.  He has since been involved in business ventures including property development and racing events. He is currently a co-owner of Team Adie Moses Racing, which competes in Historic Formula One races.

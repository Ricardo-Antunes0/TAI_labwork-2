Knights Out is an organization of Westboro Baptist Church members who travel to various cities to protest. They are best known for their protests of military funerals, which have been denounced by a wide variety of groups as insensitive and in violation of the rights of the deceased.  The Westboro Baptist Church is a small, fiercely independent evangelical congregation based in Topeka, Kansas. The church has come to international attention for its protests against military funerals – specifically, the funerals of U.S. soldiers killed in combat – with members typically arriving at the ceremonies dressed in bright pink shirts and carrying signs reading "God Hates Fags" and "God Hates America".  Knights Out was founded in 2012 by members of the Westboro Baptist Church who objected to the church's use of their travel funds for other purposes, such as protesting at schools. Members of Knights Out travel to various cities to protest different types of events – from military funerals to Pride parades – on their own dime, choosing locations that they believe will generate the most publicity for their cause.

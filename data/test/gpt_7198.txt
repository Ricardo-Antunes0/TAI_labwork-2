John Curtin (8 January 1885 – 5 July 1945) was the first Prime Minister of Australia, serving from 1939 until his death in 1945. He led Australia through World War II, becoming one of the most influential political leaders of the 20th century.  Curtin was born in Angaston, Victoria, to Irish immigrants. He attended night school to learn how to read and write, and became a clerk in a local paper mill before starting his own business. Curtin served in the Australian Army during World War I, and later fought in the Russian Revolution. After the war, he became a trade union leader and politician. In 1934, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Labor Party's deputy leader. He became Labor Party leader in 1937, and won the federal election that year.  As Prime Minister, Curtin led Australia through World War II. He instituted a number of wartime policies, including a nationalization of key industries and the creation of the Women's Army Corps (WAC). Despite widespread public support for the war effort, Curtin was criticized for his perceived inaction during the Battle of Buna–Gona. He died in office after being injured in an air crash while returning from an official visit to Britain. Curtin remains Australia's longest-serving Prime Minister and one of its most influential political leaders.

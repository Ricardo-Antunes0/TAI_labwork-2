Nahum B. Zenil is a Mexican artist who often uses his own self-portrait as the principal model for a cultural critical interpretation of Mexico, especially concerning homosexuality and mestization. Zenil was born in 1947 in the state of Veracruz. In 1959, he enrolled at the Escuela Nacional de Maestros (National Teachers' School) in Mexico City, from which he graduated in 1964. It was during this period in which Zenil became interested in painting. He later entered the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura (known as La Esmeralda) in Mexico City in 1968. He is also one of the founding members of the Semana Cultural Gay ("Cultural Gay Week"), which occurs yearly at the Museo Universitario del Chopo. His art is often compared to that of Frida Kahlo, in which the self becomes the principal object of their paintings letting the viewer discover the artists as individuals as well as the broader social and cultural contexts in which they lived through the medium of self-portraiture. Early life and education  Nahum B. Zenil was born in 1947 in Veracruz Mexico. Zenil had a rural upbringing and a lower middle-class lifestyle. Zenil lived with his mother and grandmother in the house that often appears in many of his paintings. The house, when displayed in Zenil's work, is very modest, showing only a small living room, one bedroom, and one bathroom. Zenil's father lived separately, and he worked as a teacher. This disconnection between his family would greatly inspire much of Zenil's later artworks. In Zenil's younger years, he attended La Esmeralda school. However, in 1959, Zenil enrolled at the Escuela Nacional de Maestros in Mexico City,where he study art, including; drawing, watercolor, collage, and montage.

The human voice consists of sound made by the human vocal cords. The vocal cords are a series of elastic tissues that are suspended by the larynx (voice box) above the windpipe. The air pressure inside the larynx decreases as the vocal cords open, resulting in an acoustic wave that passes through the windpipe and is heard as sound.

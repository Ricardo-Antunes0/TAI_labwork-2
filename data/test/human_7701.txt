WWF Forceable Entry is a soundtrack album by WWE (then known as the World Wrestling Federation, or WWF). Released on March 26, 2002 by Columbia Records, it features entrance music of WWE wrestlers re-recorded by various hard rock and heavy metal artists and bands. It is also the last album released under the "WWF" name, as the company changed its name to "WWE" in May 2002 after a British court ruled in favor of the World Wide Fund for Nature for ownership of the "WWF" initialism and branding (the World Wrestling Federation and the World Wide Fund for Nature had used the "WWF" name and branding since 1979 at the time). The album was a commercial success, charting at number three on the US Billboard 200. Composition Johnny Loftus of music website AllMusic categorized WWF Forceable Entry as alternative metal, post-grunge and rap metal. The album features a number of cover versions (including Kid Rock's cover of "Legs" by ZZ Top) and remixes (such as Limp Bizkit's "Rollin'" and Marilyn Manson's "The Beautiful People"), as well as new tracks. Some tracks are also new recordings of wrestlers' entrance themes, including Drowning Pool's cover of Mot√∂rhead's "The Game" (Triple H) and Disturbed's recording "Glass Shatters" (Stone Cold Steve Austin). Finger Eleven's song "Slow Chemical" (Kane) is a bonus track on some versions of the album as well.

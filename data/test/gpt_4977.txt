In representation theory, the Langlands program is a mathematical theory of symmetry and related structures. It was introduced in 1995 by Roger Penrose and Geoffrey Hatcher, and is named after Robin Langlands.  The Langlands program is a generalization of the theory of Abelian groups, which was pioneered by Alexander Grothendieck in the 1950s. In the Langlands program, we seek a theory of symmetry groups and their associated structures on an arbitrary "possible universe" (a set of strings that could have been chosen at random). This includes not only the familiar Abelian groups but also more exotic structures such as Lie groups, knot groups, and various types of manifolds.  The goal of the Langlands program is to find a "Einsteinâ€“Cartan equation" (or some similar structure) that governs the symmetry groups and their associated structures. This equation should be consistent with all known facts about the symmetry groups and their associated structures (including the laws of physics), and should also be powerful enough to describe all sorts of strange phenomena. So far, no such equation has been found, but the Langlands program is still very active.

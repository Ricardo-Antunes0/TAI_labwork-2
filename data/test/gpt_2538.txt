Klaus Schulten (January 12, 1947 â€“ October 30, 2007) was a German-born American mathematician, who worked in the field of topology.  Klaus Schulten was born in Bad Honnef, Rhineland-Palatinate, West Germany. After completing his Abitur at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in 1967, he studied mathematics at the University of Bonn, where he earned his doctorate in 1972 under the supervision of Dietrich Neumann.  From 1972 to 1976, Schulten was a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University under the supervision of David Mumford. In 1976 he became an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and in 2001 became a full professor there. He was also a visiting professor at several universities, including the University of Paris VI and Moscow State University.  Schulten's research focused on topology, with particular emphasis on knot theory and its applications to various fields such as mechanics, physics and chemistry. He was also known for his work on differential geometry and probability theory.  Schulten died from cancer on October 30, 2007, at the age of 60.

A fluidized bed reactor (FBR) is a type of nuclear reactor in which the fuel is dispersed in a continuous flow of inert gas or liquid. The inert gas or liquid serves as a moderator, preventing the fuel from reacting and producing radioactive material.   FBRs have several advantages over other types of reactors. They are inherently safe because they do not produce hot enough fuel rods to melt, and they can be operated at higher temperatures, making them more efficient at producing electricity. FBRs are also cheaper to operate than other types of reactors, and they can be used to produce both plutonium and uranium.

A thermoplastic-sheathed cable (TPS) consists of a thermoplastic sheath wrapped around a metal or other stiff core. The core provides the necessary stiffness and strength, while the sheath keeps noise and other external factors at bay.  TPSs are used in a variety of applications, from telecommunications to power transmission. They are particularly advantageous when noise or vibration is a concern, as the sheath can dampen these vibrations. Additionally, TPSs are often easier to work with than traditional cables due to their flexible sheath.

is a late Kamakura period Japanese castle located in the town of Chihaya, Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan.  The castle was built on the site of a former temple in the early 12th century by the local Fujiwara clan. It was seized by the Minamoto clan in 1185 and became their main stronghold in the Kant≈ç region. The castle passed through a number of hands before coming under the control of the Chihaya family in 1614. The castle was damaged during the Meiji period and has since been restored. It is now open to the public.  The castle consists of a number of buildings including a keep, a donjon, and a bailey. The keep is made up of two concentric walls with a large central tower. The donjon is located on top of the keep and is similar in shape but much smaller. The bailey is located to the south-west of the donjon and consists of several well-maintained buildings including a chapel.

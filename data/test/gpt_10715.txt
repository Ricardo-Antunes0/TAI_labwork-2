In taxonomy, the Halobacteriales are an order of single-celled, photosynthetic, halophilic organisms. This order is composed of seven families and contains over 1,000 species. The majority of these species are found in salt lakes and hypersaline environments. They are also found in brackish water and on the surface of some mineral surfaces.  The Halobacteriales are unique among prokaryotes in that they can employ both a respiratory and an anaerobic metabolism. Many species are capable of respiration using oxygen gas as the electron donor, but others use organic matter as their sole electron donor. The Halobacteriales are also unique in that they can form endospores. These spores can survive for extended periods of time in hostile environments and can be used to re-colonize a new area.

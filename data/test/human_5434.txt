The Terrible class was a group of four ironclad barbette ships built for the French Navy in the late 1870s and early 1880s. The class consisted of , , , and . They were built as part of a fleet plan started in 1872 after the Franco-Prussian War and were designed in response to the German  of barbette ships. The Terribles were scaled down versions of the , with one less main gun, though they were of significantly larger caliber. Because the ships were intended for operations against the German fleet in the shallow Baltic Sea, they had a low draft and freeboard, which greatly hampered their seakeeping and thus reduced their ability to be usefully employed after entering service. Armament consisted of a pair of  guns in individual barbettes, which were the largest guns ever mounted on a French capital ship. Because of their poor seakeeping, the ships had limited careers, seeing active service for only a few years in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Thereafter, they spent much of their time in reserve, being activated only for fleet maneuvers. Requin made one voyage abroad to visit Russia and Great Britain in 1891. The ships were modernized in the late 1890s, receiving new guns, and in the case of Requin, new engines and boilers and some upgrades to her armor. Terrible was broken up in 1911, and only Requin was still in service by the start of World War I in 1914. She was stationed as a guard ship in the Suez Canal, and she helped to repel an Ottoman attack in February 1915. She was scrapped in 1920 and the other two vessels were discarded in 1927.

Notelaea ligustrina, known as the privet mock orange, is a deciduous tree in the family Moraceae. The specific epithet ligustrina is from the Latin word ligustrum meaning "of or from Liguria", where the species is native. It grows to a height of about 10 m and has a trunk diameter of about 1 m. The bark is scaly and red-brown. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, 5–8 cm long and 2–3 cm wide, with a serrated margin. The flowers are white, 4–5 cm diameter, with five petals that are slightly curved backwards. The fruit is a spherical capsule 2–3 cm diameter, containing several small black seeds.   The privet mock orange is commonly found in dry areas of Europe, North Africa, and southwest Asia. It is considered an invasive species in parts of North America.

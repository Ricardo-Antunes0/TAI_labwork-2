Campaigns TV was a French television channel that broadcast from May 2002 to September 2006. It was the first French television channel devoted exclusively to political advertising.  The channel was founded by Arnaud Lagardère, who also owned the TV channel TF1. Lagardère hoped that Campaigns TV would become the leading French television channel for political advertising. The channel was available on cable and satellite TV in France, and also streamed online.  Campaigns TV aired a variety of political advertisements, from presidential campaign ads to ads for local elections. The channel also aired documentaries about political campaigning, as well as shows about political history.  In September 2006, Campaigns TV was shut down due to financial difficulties. Arnaud Lagardère later announced that he was selling TF1 to the RTL Group, and that Campaigns TV would be merged into RTL TV.

The WRc Group is a company providing research and consultancy in water, waste and the environment in the United Kingdom. A government body set up in 1927 was merged in the 1970s with the Water Research Association and the Water Resouces Board to form the Water Research Centre, which was controlled by the regional water authorities; the organisation was privatised in 1989 as WRc plc, then acquired by RSK Group in 2020. History The organisation was created in 1927 by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) as the Water Pollution Research Board (WPRB). The Board had no laboratories and fulfilled its remit of providing research and advice on sewage treatment by outsourcing and conducting surveys. Laboratory facilities finally became available in 1940 when DSIR set up the Water Pollution Research Laboratory (WPRL) in Watford. During the Second World War WPRL also worked in other areas, notably the creation of a device for airmen to make sea water acceptable as drinking water.

Pucciniomycotina is a subdivision of fungus within the phylum Ascomycota. The name is derived from the Italian opera composer Giacomo Puccini, who first studied the taxonomy of fungi in the early 1900s.  Pucciniomycotina is a group of fungi that are closely related to members of the genus Penicillium. These fungi form a widespread group, found in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Pucciniomycotina fungi are characterised by their ability to form symbiotic relationships with plants. These partnerships provide the fungus with a source of food and protection from environmental stressors.  Pucciniomycotina fungi are important contributors to the global economy. They are used as ingredients in medications and food products, and their biomass is used for energy production. The group is also responsible for significant environmental damage, particularly in water resources. However, research into Pucciniomycotina fungus has led to new insights into plant-fungus symbioses and how they contribute to ecosystems.

DAT Solutions, LLC, often referred to as DAT Freight & Analytics, and originally known as Dial-a-Truck, is a US-based freight exchange service ("load board") and provider of transportation information serving North America. Freight exchange services are used to match material ("loads") that needs to be shipped with over-the-road carriers that can be hired to move those loads. DAT was established in 1978 and is part of Roper Technologies. It's co-headquartered in Denver, Colorado and Beaverton, Oregon. Claude Pumilia is President and CEO, responsible for DATâ€™s strategy and execution. History  In 1958, Monroe 'Moe' Jubitz, opened Fleet Leasing, Inc., a truck leasing and maintenance company in Portland, Oregon. Jubitz later expanded to provide fuel, food, and accommodations to truckers on the road, the origin of Jubitz Truck Stop. The trucking industry was deregulated in the 1970s, encouraging independent truck drivers and small companies to find extra loads rather than returning empty. Jubitz noticed drivers hanging around his truck stop after the usual meal and shower, hoping to find a load. He decided to start signing up brokers and shippers who needed freight hauled from Portland. Before the service, truck drivers seeking loads left handwritten notes on a bulletin board at the Jubitz Truck Stop in Portland for shippers and freight brokers seeking truckers to move their freight. Jubitz began posting the loads on a monitor at the truck stop and charging drivers a fee for the phone number of the company wanting to move freight.

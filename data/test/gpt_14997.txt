Sa'och (, also, "Sauch") is an endangered, nuclear-speaking, isolate language of the Athabaskan family spoken by the Sa'och people of Alaska.  The Sa'och language is spoken by the Sa'och people in the Yukon and Kuskokwim Regions of Alaska. There are currently around 30 speakers of the language, all elderly. The language is considered endangered, with only a few fluent speakers remaining.  Sa'och is an isolate language, meaning that it is not related to any other languages in the world. It is thought to be part of the Athabaskan family, but there is no conclusive evidence to support this claim.  The Sa'och people are nomadic reindeerherders who live in small villages along the banks of the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers. The language is used for communication between members of the village community, as well as for ceremonial purposes.

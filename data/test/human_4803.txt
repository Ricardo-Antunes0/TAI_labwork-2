With a history stretching back to 1807, when President Thomas Jefferson asked for a survey of the young Nation's coast, the office serves America's maritime trade, fishing fleets, and recreational sailors. Responsible for surveying and charting America's coastal and territorial waters as well as the Great Lakes, Coast Survey's hydrographic data, nautical products, research, and navigational services form an essential foundation for ocean transportation and the maritime economy.

Ferguson is an unincorporated community in the West Kootenay region of southeastern British Columbia. The near ghost town is immediately northwest of the confluence of Ferguson Creek into Lardeau Creek. The locality, on Ferguson Rd and off BC Highway 31, is by road about  north of Nelson and  by road and ferry southeast of Revelstoke. Name origin In 1891, prospector David Ferguson arrived in the region. By early 1894, he lived at the Forks (referring to the confluence) but named his ranch Ferguson City. Within months, he had renamed the property St. Davidâ€™s and found three small gold nuggets on his land. The next year, he built a hotel. The strategic location was a short distance from several notable mines. However, he did not announce the development of his new town, named Ferguson, until 1896. Locally, the name Lardeau Forks must have been in common use, because it was used in the 1897 Henderson's directory. The townsite survey was not completed until late 1898.

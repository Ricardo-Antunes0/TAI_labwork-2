Kpengla was a King of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1774 until 1789.  Kpengla followed his father Tegbessou to the throne and much of his administration was defined by the increasing Atlantic slave trade and regional rivalry over the profits from this trade.  His attempts to control the slave trade generally failed, and when he died of smallpox in 1789, his son Agonglo came to the throne and ended many of his policies. Rise to power The Kingdom of Dahomey had increased significantly in power since the 1720s.  King Agaja (1718-1740) had expanded the kingdom to the key Atlantic ports of Whydah and Allada.  Agaja's son King Tegbessou (1740-1774) had similarly expanded the kingdom. However, the kingdom remained a tributary to the Oyo Empire, owing yearly gifts to the Oyo Empire.  The slave trade had increased substantially along the coast with European traders.  During the last years of Tegbessou's reign, the Oyo Empire began restricting the slave trade through Dahomey and channeling slaves to other ports or to charge high prices through Dahomey.  The shortage became so problematic that Tegbessou was forced to sell his own slaves to keep the trade going.

Jovian, surnamed Hypatus or Ceparius (Italian: Gioviano), was the first governor of Egypt, who, in 395 BC, annulled the treaty made between Perdiccas and Ptolemy, and assumed the sovereignty of Egypt. He reigned nineteen years.  Jovian was the son of Antipater, who had been one of the regents for Alexander the Great. He distinguished himself in the wars of his father against Thebes and Corinth; and on the death of Antipater in 323 BC he was appointed to the regency for Alexander's infant son by Cassander, Ptolemy. When Alexander died in 323 BC, Jovian assumed the government of Macedonia. In 318 BC he was present at the battle of Ipsus, where he showed signal bravery. In 317 BC he repelled an attack of Antigonus I Monophthalmus at Thermopylae; and in 314 BC he compelled Demetrius Poliorcetes to withdraw from Greece into Phrygia. In 312 BC he joined Alexander's army in Bactria, and aided him in his march through India to Susa.  In 310 BC Jovian helped to suppress a revolt at Athens led by Agis and Eubulus. In 309 BC he captured Gaza from Ptolemy I Soter. In 308 BC he concluded a treaty with Seleucus I Nicator, by which Seleucus ceded Syria to him. In 307 BC he marched into Cilicia

Gabriel Georges Nahas (March 4, 1920 – March 9, 2006) was a French-born American mathematician who made important contributions to the theory of partial differential equations. He is best known for his work on the Nahas flow, a solution to the Navier–Stokes equation in which the flow is governed by a nonlinear diffusion equation.  Gabriel Georges Nahas was born in 1920 in Marseille, France to Greek immigrants. He earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Strasbourg in 1938 and his doctorate from the University of Paris in 1942.  Nahas worked at the University of California, Berkeley from 1949 to 1952, where he coauthored a book on linear partial differential equations with David Bohm. He then moved to Princeton University where he served as a professor until his retirement in 1988.  Nahas died in 2006 at the age of 87.

Radio & Records (R&R) was a trade publication providing news and airplay information for the radio and music industries.  It started as an independent trade from 1973 to 2006 until VNU Media took over in 2006 and became a relaunched sister trade to Billboard, until its final issue in 2009. History The company was founded in 1973 and published its first issue on October 5 of that year. Founders included Bob Wilson and Robert Kardashian. The publication was issued in a weekly print edition, and it also issued a bi-annual Directory. R&R published its print edition from 1973 through August 4, 2006. Its weekly columns and features were intended to inform and educate the radio industry by each format, in addition to format-specific charts based on radio airplay.  The charts eventually became populated by data from Mediabase, a company that monitors and tracks radio airplay in cities across the U.S. From 1987 to 2002 it was owned by Westwood One, which collaborated with Radio & Records to use its charts and format editors for WWOne's syndicated radio programs.

Thom Yorke wrote "New Slaves" in December 2002, at his home studio in Oxfordshire. The song was recorded during the sessions for Radiohead's 2003 album "Hail to the Thief". In an interview with "NME", Yorke said that "New Slaves" is about people who have been kidnapped and are being held as slaves: It's about people in the Third World who are being kidnapped and sold into slavery. I wrote it about a guy I knew who'd been kidnapped in Africa. It's a bit of a dark song, but I think it's got a good mood to it.

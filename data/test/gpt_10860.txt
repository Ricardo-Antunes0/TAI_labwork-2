Alexey Nikolayevich Veselovsky (, 9 July 1843, Moscow – 23 December 1927, Moscow) was a Russian painter and illustrator.  Born to a family of artists, Veselovsky began his training at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in 1868. After graduating in 1872, he traveled to Europe, where he continued his studies at the Académie Julian and the Royal Academy of Arts in London. He returned to Russia in 1875 and soon found success as an illustrator for children's books. Veselovsky also created illustrations for several popular Russian novels of the time, including Leo Tolstoy's "War and Peace" and Ivan Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons".   In 1896, Veselovsky was awarded the Order of St. Anna for his contributions to Russian art. He retired from painting in 1902 but continued to work as an illustrator until his death in 1927.

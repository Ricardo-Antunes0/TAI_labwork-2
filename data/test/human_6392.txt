Grunwald  is a part of the city of Poznań in western Poland. It was one of the five governmental districts (dzielnica) into which the city was divided prior to 1990, and which are retained for certain administrative purposes (see Administrative division of Poznań). The name "Grunwald" comes from the name of the street ulica Grunwaldzka, which had been so named in 1919 in commemoration of the Battle of Grunwald. A neighbourhood located in the vicinity of that street came to be known as Grunwald, and that name was transferred to the entire dzielnica, covering the south-western parts of the city, on its creation in 1954. The name continues to be popularly used to refer specifically to the original neighbourhood, as reflected in the names of three of the osiedles into which Poznań is now divided: Stary Grunwald ("Old Grunwald"), Grunwald Północ ("Grunwald North") and Grunwald Południe ("Grunwald South"). For other osiedles contained within the wider district, see Administrative division of Poznań.

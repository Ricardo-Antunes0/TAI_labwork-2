The 2015 Honduran Cup is referred to as the Copa Presidente de Honduras for sponsorship reasons.  The cup is a creation of the Honduran government funded by money allocated to national security fund.  Its purpose is to support the growth of sport to detract the youth from vices and to promote national tourism for rural towns. The cup was contested by 64 teams from the top 3 divisions of the country.  There was a total of 10 teams from La Liga Nacional (First Division), 27 from Liga de Ascenso (Second Division) and 27 from Liga Mayor (Third Division).  It was the first cup in which teams outside the top division participated.  Some stipulations included that the lower seeded team hosted the matchup and five substitutions were allowed.  The first 4 rounds were single match with penalties if match ended in ties.  The quarterfinal and semifinal rounds were home-and-away while the one-match final was hosted in a neutral venue.

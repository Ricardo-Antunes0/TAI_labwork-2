In mathematics, the Newtonian potential or Newton's potential is a mathematical function that describes the energy of a particle or system in terms of its position and velocity. It is named after English mathematician Isaac Newton.  The Newtonian potential describes the energy of a particle or system in terms of its position and velocity. It is named after English mathematician Isaac Newton. The potential can be used to calculate the energy of a particle in any arbitrary coordinate system, and it is often used in physics to calculate the energy of particles in an elastic collision.

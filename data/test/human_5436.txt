WBFY-LP is a low-power, community radio station in Belfast, Maine, United States.  It broadcasts at 100.9 FM from a studio in the basement of Waterfall Arts (a former elementary school) on High Street. The range of the signal is 10â€“20 miles depending on geographic and weather conditions. History  The license is held by the City of Belfast, but the station was created and is run by a group of volunteers, called Belfast Community Radio.  This group was put together in a hurry during the fall of 2016, because the construction permit would expire if the station was not on the air by late January 2017. In eight weeks, a fundraising group led by Jennifer Hill and Erik Klausmeyer raised about $40,000 in business and individual donations, a foundation grant, and in-kind donations of equipment and furnishings.  Community building events included a potluck with musical acts, an outdoor 'radio studio' for children during Halloween trick-or-treat, and a movie at the Colonial Theater.  Other major players in this early phase were Karen Nelson, Patrick Walsh, Petra Hall and Wylie Fowler.

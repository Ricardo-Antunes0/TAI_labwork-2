A Zeeman slower is a scientific apparatus used to measure the speed of an electron in a gas. It is named after the Dutch physicist Pieter J.A. Zeeman who developed it in the early 1900s.  The Zeeman slower is an apparatus used to measure the speed of an electron in a gas. It is named after the Dutch physicist Pieter J.A. Zeeman who developed it in the early 1900s. The Zeeman slower uses a magnetic field to trap electrons in a stationary state and measure their speed. This information can be used to study the behavior of electrons in gases, and to determine the properties of materials such as gases and semiconductors.

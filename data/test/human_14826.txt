Hartland Abbey is a former abbey and current family home to the Stucley family.  It is located in Hartland, Devon.  The current owner is Sir Hugh George Copplestone Bampfylde Stucley, 6th Baronet. History Hartland Abbey was built in 1157 and consecrated by Bartholomew Iscanus in 1160. (Bartholomew was appointed Bishop of Exeter the following year.) Hartland was of the  Augustinian order. The Botreaux family of Boscastle, Cornwall, were among the most generous donors to the Abbey. (Male heirs were apparently all named William, until the death in 1462 of the last of the line William de Botreaux, 3rd Baron Botreaux.) In 1187 a William de Botreaux gave the advowsons of the churches in his manors of Molland and Knowstone in Devon, and of the church of Forrabury in his Cornish manor of Boscastle, to the Abbey. The grants were confirmed by a charter temp. from King Richard I (1189-1199) and the property was converted into an Augustinian Abbey in 1189.

Grant Village is a developed area of the city of Glasgow, Scotland. It is located in the north-west of the city and is bounded by Kelvin Way to the south, Crow Road to the north, and Paisley Road to the east. The village has a population of around 8,000.  Grant Village was first developed in the early 1960s as a result of efforts by the Glasgow Corporation to improve social conditions in the area. The village was initially built on land that had been earmarked for housing but had been left derelict following World War II. Construction of the village began in 1962 and it was completed in 1965. The village was designed by architects David Bryce and George Smith and contains a number of notable buildings, including the Grant Primary School, which was opened in 1967.  The village has undergone a number of redevelopment projects over the years, most recently in 2007. This involved the construction of a new supermarket, a new commercial development, and new apartments. Grant Village is also home to a number of cultural institutions, including the Grant Theatre and the Glasgow Film Theatre.

Commentator (foaled March 27, 2001), is an American Thoroughbred racehorse who was bred in Kentucky by Mrs. James T. Gentry and raced under the ownership of his trainer, Bill Mott. He is best known for his major win in the 2002 Belmont Stakes, in which he defeated older horses and established himself as one of the most consistent horses in American racing. Commentator also finished second in the 2004 Kentucky Derby and third in the Preakness Stakes.  Commentator was retired from racing after a disappointing performance in the 2006 Dubai World Cup. He has since been retired to stud at Mott's facility in Lexington, Kentucky.

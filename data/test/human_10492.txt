Bryce Resort is a 400-acre member-owned resort the northern part of Virginia's Shenandoah Valley that is open to the public. Opened in 1965 and located near the West Virginia border, 11 miles west of Mount Jackson, Virginia. The resort is very popular with residents of the valley, as well as families and tourists from the Washington, D.C. area, some 115 miles (185Â km) away. Principal activities include skiing, golf, mountain activities, mountain biking, tennis, fishing, and water sports at Lake Laura and the resort pool. The ski area was opened as a year-round resort by Pete and Julie Brice in 1965, seeking to attract visitors drawn to the nearby Orkney Springs, and has been in operation ever since. In December 2020 Bryce was rated one of the Top 25 family-friendly ski resorts in North America by Yelp. Due to the relatively temperate climate of northwestern Virginia, the resort relies considerably on artificial snowmaking, and was one of the first and only resorts in North America to introduce grass skiing during summer months though that activity is no longer supported.  Weather permitted, golf is played year-round. The 18-hole PGA Championship course offers challenges of trees and a creek that meanders throughout.

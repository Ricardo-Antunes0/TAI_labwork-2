Ice diving is a form of diving that uses an ice-cold water supply to suppress the body's heat exchange process. The diver uses a diving suit and breathing apparatus to descend to a lower temperature than the surrounding water, and then returns to the surface.   The main advantage of ice diving is that it allows divers to explore areas that are inaccessible to warm-blooded humans. This includes cold, nutrient-rich waters near the bottom of the sea, as well as areas with extreme temperatures and hostile environments. Another advantage is that ice diving can be done without the need for scuba equipment, making it a popular choice for diving beginners.

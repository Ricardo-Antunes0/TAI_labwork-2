Uveitis–Glaucoma–Hyphaema (UGH) syndrome also known as Ellingson syndrome is a complication of cataract surgery, caused by intraocular lens subluxation or dislocation. The chafing of mispositioned intraocular lens over iris, ciliary body or iridocorneal angle cause elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) anterior uveitis and hyphema. It is most commonly caused by anterior chamber IOLs and sulcus IOLs but, the condition can be seen with any type of IOL, including posterior chamber lenses and cosmetic iris implants. Pathophysiology The mechanical irritation of mispositioned intraocular lens over iris, ciliary body or iridocorneal angle cause spectrum of iris transillumination defects including anterior uveitis, hyphema and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Uveitis results from mechanical breakdown of the blood–aqueous barrier and resultant intraocular inflammation. A hyphema results from damage to vascular tissue of the iris, ciliary body, or angle by mispositioned IOL. Elevated intraocular pressure can be caused by pigment dispersion, uveitis, hyphema or direct blocking of aqueous humor drainage system.

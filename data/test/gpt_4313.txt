The Ecopass program was a traffic pollution control initiative in the United Kingdom which ran from 1987 to 2003. The program was operated by the Department for Transport.   The Ecopass was a system of roadside sensors which measured the levels of pollution in the atmosphere and then issued fines to drivers who exceeded authorised levels. The main types of pollution measured were carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. The fines were based on the level of pollution detected, with the most serious fines incurred for those driving in areas with the highest levels of pollution.  The Ecopass was controversial from its inception. Many drivers felt that it was unfair and arbitrary, as the levels of pollution detected could vary significantly from day to day. Furthermore, many felt that it was ineffective in controlling traffic pollution levels, as enforcement was generally lax. The Ecopass was eventually phased out in 2003 due to cost concerns and a lack of public support.

Nonpareil also Non Pareil (from the French "pas pareil"), Guyana, is a small, mostly uninhabited island in the Essequibo River, just south of the Demerara River, in Guyana. The island is part of the Berbice-Essequibo Region, and is administered by the Ministry of Public Infrastructure.  The island is named for its nonpareil diamond mine, which operated from 1871 to 1899. Diamond mining ceased on the island in 1909 due to low diamond prices and increased production in other mines. The island's only inhabitants are descendants of the original miners and their families. Nonpareil is now a tourist destination with a few small hotels and bungalows.

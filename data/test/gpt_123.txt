The Vénus de Quinipily  is an 18th century neoclassical sculpture created by the French artist Jean-Jacques Rousseau. It is located in the gardens of the Palace of Versailles, near the Petit Trianon. The statue is made of white marble and measures 73 cm high and 110 cm wide. The pedestal on which it stands is also made of white marble and has a hexagonal base, surmounted by a Corinthian capital.   The statue was commissioned in 1768 by Louis XV to commemorate his wife, the Austrian archduchess Marie-Thérèse of Austria, who had died the previous year. It was originally placed in front of the main entrance to the palace, but was moved to its current location in 1819.   The Vénus de Quinipily is one of the most famous sculptures in France and is visited by millions of people each year.

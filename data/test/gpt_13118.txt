Roger Craft Peace (May 19, 1899August 20, 1984) was an American scientist, mathematician and electrical engineer. He is best known for his seminal work on the theory of linear feedback amplifiers (LFAs) and for his contributions to signal processing and communication engineering.  Peace was born in 1899 in Lawrence, Kansas, to a family of modest means. He attended the University of Kansas, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1916. After serving in World War I, Peace returned to the University of Kansas and received his master's degree in 1919 and his doctorate in 1922.  Peace began his career as a research physicist at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1923. He soon became one of the leading researchers at Bell Labs, and in 1949 he was appointed its vice president for research. In 1951 he was appointed president of the New York Institute of Technology (now Polytechnic University), a position he held until 1962.  Peace retired from active research work in 1963 but continued to contribute to the field of signal processing until his death eight years later. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1965 and to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Fellow designation in 1966. He was also awarded the IEEE Medal of Honor in 1971.

Jessie Margaret Soga, LRAM (21 August 1870 – 23 February 1954) was a Xhosa/Scottish contralto singer, music teacher and suffragist. She was described as the only black suffrage campaigner based in Scotland. Soga was a lead member of the Women's Freedom League in Glasgow and later joined the Women's Social and Political Union; but did not carry out militant activity, using her organisational skills and musical talent to raise funds. Family and early life Jessie Soga was the youngest daughter of Reverend Tiyo Soga (1831–1871), the first black South African minister to be ordained, who became a missionary and translator. She was born in Tutura (Somerville) in Transkei, the Cape, South Africa, a year before her father's death in 1871. Her mother was Scottish missionary Janet Burnside (1827–1903), who met her father when he was in Scotland whilst studying theology in Glasgow. Her mother and siblings returned to Scotland when he died, and Jessie and all the other children went to school at Dollar Academy.

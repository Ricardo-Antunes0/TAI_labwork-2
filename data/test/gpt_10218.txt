Cyberwarfare is the use of digital attacks and counterattacks to damage or disable adversary computer systems. Cyberwarfare is a strategic application of information technology that can be used for military advantage or to paralyse an adversary's economic or political system.  Cyberwarfare has been employed by states and non-state actors for offensive and defensive purposes. The effectiveness of cyberwarfare capabilities has been enhanced by the widespread use of computers and the Internet. Cyberwarfare is a new form of warfare that is evolving rapidly, and its methods, targets, and consequences are still being understood.  The term "cyberwarfare" was first used in 1977 by US National Security Council Staff member Barry Blechman in a report on US computer vulnerabilities. The term gained widespread attention following the Russian military's use of cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 and the US-led global response.

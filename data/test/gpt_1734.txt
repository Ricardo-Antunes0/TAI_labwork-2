The grammar of the Marathi language shares many features with the grammar of other Indo-Aryan languages, but there are also significant differences. This article provides an overview of the Marathi language's grammar.  The Marathi language is spoken in the state of Maharashtra in India. It is the official language of Maharashtra and one of the 22 official languages of India. There are around 20 million Marathi speakers worldwide.  The Marathi language is a member of the Indo-Aryan family of languages. It is closely related to Hindi, Punjabi, and Bengali, but has its own unique features. For example, Marathi has a compound verb tense system, which is different from Hindi and Punjabi. Marathi also has a number of other unique features, such as its system for marking possession (through the use of prefixes and suffixes).  Marathi is a monosyllabic language, which means that each word is made up of one syllable. There are twenty consonants in Marathi (including letters that cannot be pronounced due to constraints in the language), and six vowels. These six vowels can be grouped into two classes: short vowels (e.g. a, i, o, u) and long vowels (e.g. aa, ii, oo, uu). There is no written distinction between short and long vowels, but they are pronounced differently in different contexts.   Marathi has a simple sentence structure.

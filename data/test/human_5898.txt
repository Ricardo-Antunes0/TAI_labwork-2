Midsumma is Victoria's premier queer arts and cultural organisation, bringing together a diverse mix of LGBTQIA+ artists, performers, communities and audiences. The primary event, Midsumma Festival, usually runs over 22 days in Melbourne's summer (January/February) with an explosion of queer events that center around both hidden and mainstream queer culture, involving local, interstate and international artists. The festival program comprises a curated Midsumma Presents program plus the community-driven Open-access stream, and is made up of diverse art forms and genres, including visual arts, live music, theatre, spoken word, cabaret, film, parties, sport, social events, and public forums. In addition to the primary festival in summer, Midsumma works year-round to provide artists, social-changers and culture-makers with support and tools to create, present and promote their work. The 22 day Festival Melbourne's beloved Midsumma Festival is normally held over 22 days in January and early February. A diverse array of close to 200 events are presented to audiences of over 260,000 thanks to involvement by over 5000 culture-makers in around 100 different venues across Melbourne and wider Victoria. The festival usually opens in a CBD park with the massive Midsumma Carnival, which has around 120,000 attendees. The annual Pride March follows later in the festival and almost half the events are free. Midsumma was started by the city's Gay Business Association in 1988 to celebrate the Melbourne queer community's arts and culture.  Due to COVID-19, the 2021 festival will run, exceptionally, from 19 April to 5 May with the 2021 Pride March held on 23 May.

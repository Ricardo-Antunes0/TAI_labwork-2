The 1987â€“1989 JVP insurrection, also known as the JVP War or the Tamil war, was a three-year-long armed conflict fought by the Janatha Vimukthi Periyar (JVP) against the Sri Lankan government. The insurrection began on 17 May 1987, with an initial wave of attacks on government targets in Jaffna and Vavuniya districts. It escalated rapidly, with clashes involving hundreds of fighters on both sides and the Sri Lankan military fighting back with greater intensity. By 1989, the JVP had largely been defeated, although pockets of resistance remained.  The JVP insurgency was a response to decades of discrimination and persecution against the Tamil community in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan government viewed the Tamils as a threat, viewing their demands for autonomy or independence as a threat to national unity. The JVP also fought for the rights of all Tamils, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations.  The Sri Lankan military responded to the JVP insurgency with a campaign of violence and scorched earth tactics. They used force to quash any resistance and destroy villages suspected of being sympathetic to the JVP. Thousands of civilians were killed, injured or forced into exile during the conflict. The Sri Lankan government emerged from the conflict as the victor, claiming victory over the JVP and eradicating what remained of their insurgency. However, the legacy of the JVP insurgency continues to be felt by Tamils living in Sri Lanka today.

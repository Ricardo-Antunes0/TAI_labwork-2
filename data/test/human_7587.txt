"Exit Event" is the series finale of the comedy series Silicon Valley. The episode was written and directed by Alec Berg and originally aired on HBO on December 8, 2019. In the episode, the Pied Piper team attempts to sabotage the company's million-dollar launch in order to prevent the decentralized system from potentially abolishing internet privacy. Plot After their surprising success at RussFest, Pied Piper strikes a $100 million dollar deal with AT&T to build their decentralized internet on their platform. As the team celebrates, Monica (Amanda Crew) gives Richard (Thomas Middleditch) a framed screenshot of their text conversation as a gift. However, Richard discovers that one of the text messages he sent containing a punctuation error was auto-corrected, although messages between Monica and him were encrypted. Richard spends the night trying to find out how the correction was made and tells the team about it the next morning. The team realizes that PiperNet's AI compression abilities have become so advanced that it can bypass numerous advanced encryptions, potentially eradicating all privacy measures. Realizing the severity of its potential, Gilfoyle (Martin Starr) proposes that the only way to prevent PiperNet from abolishing privacy is to sabotage it at its launch. After initial opposition, Richard reluctantly agrees to sabotage PiperNet. But Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani) recuses himself from the effort, thinking that his pride would prevent the sabotage from going through.

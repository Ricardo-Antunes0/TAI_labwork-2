The Purification Rundown, also known as the detoxification or cleansing program, is a type of detoxification protocol used in the treatment of drug addiction and alcoholism. The PURPOSE of the Purification Rundown is to cleanse the body of toxins and impurities that have accumulated over time, and to stimulate the body's natural defenses against addiction and other diseases.  The Purification Rundown is a seven-day detoxification program that was developed by Dr. Humphry Osmond in the late 1950s. The PURPOSE of the Purification Rundown is to cleanse the body of toxins and impurities that have accumulated over time, and to stimulate the body's natural defenses against addiction and other diseases. The program is based on the principle that disease results from the accumulation of toxins in the body.  The Purification Rundown consists of four stages:  The first stage, called the Cleanse, involves fasting for 14 days. During this stage, you drink a special detoxifying drink every day.  The second stage, called the Detoxifier, involves taking various cleansing supplements.  The third stage, called the Corrective, involves taking various anti-addiction and health-promoting supplements.  The fourth stage, called the Rejuvenator, involves taking a series of supplements to help restore your health and improve your appearance.

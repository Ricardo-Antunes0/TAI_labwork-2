There have been two baronetcies created for members of the Hanmer family of Flintshire, Wales, one in the Baronetage of England and one in the Baronetage of Great Britain. Only one creation is extant as of 2008. The third Baronet of the second creation was elevated to the peerage as Baron Hanmer in 1872, a title which became extinct in 1881. The family name derived from the manor of Hanmer in the Diocese of St. Asaph. The Hanmer Baronetcy, of Hanmer in the County of Flint, was created in the Baronetage of England on 8 July 1620 for John Hanmer, subsequently Member of Parliament for Flintshire. The second Baronet represented Flint and Flintshire in the House of Commons. The third Baronet was Member of Parliament for Flint and Evesham and was killed in a duel. His nephew the fourth Baronet sat for Thetford, Flintshire and Suffolk and served as Speaker of the House of Commons. The title became extinct on the latter's death in 1746.

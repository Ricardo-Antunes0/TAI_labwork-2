In atomic physics, the electron magnetic moment, denoted by Î¼, is a physical property of an electron that measures its ability to cause a magnetic field. It is one of the four fundamental properties of an electron.  The electron magnetic moment is mainly determined by the electron's nuclear spin and its orbital angular momentum. The electron magnetic moment of a particle can be used to study the properties and behavior of subatomic particles, and can be used in the construction of quantum computers.

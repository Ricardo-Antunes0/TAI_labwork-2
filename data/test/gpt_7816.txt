Dog Mountain rises above the north side of the mouth of the Columbia River about 25 miles north of Astoria, Oregon. The mountain was so named by the native Chinook Indians because their canine friends would often run up the slopes and play.  The mountain is mostly composed of ancient Cretaceous and Jurassic sedimentary rocks including sandstone, shale, and mudstone. The oldest rocks on the mountain are about 145 million years old. About 70 million years ago a major Laramide orogeny uplifted the mountain, and during the Cenozoic Era (65 to 1.8 million years ago) erosion removed much of the older rocks. The most recent rocks on the mountain were deposited about 10,000 years ago during the last ice age.  The peak of Dog Mountain is about 4,050 feet (1,230 meters) high, and it has a prominence of about 1,500 feet (457 meters). The mountain is surrounded by several small valleys, including Dog Creek Valley to the east, Big Dog Valley to the northwest, and Eagle Ridge Valley to the south. The Columbia River forms Dog Mountain's western border.

Manhattan Melodrama is a 1934 American pre-Code drama film directed by Michael Curtiz. The screenplay by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett is based on the 1930 play of the same name by Marc Connelly.  The film stars James Cagney, Joan Blondell, George Raft, and Ann Dvorak.  In the early 1920s, New York City is a hotbed of crime and corruption. As the police department's top detective, Joe Garrow (James Cagney) is determined to take down the city's criminals. His latest target is crooked politician Franklin Stokes (George Raft). Garrow's partner, Lt. Murtaugh (Don Ameche), urges him to give up the chase, but Garrow is determined to bring Stokes to justice.   One night, Garrow happens upon Stokes in a hotel room with his mistress, Evelyn Nesbitt (Joan Blondell). Garrow arrests Stokes and takes him to jail. However, Stokes manages to bribe his way out of custody and goes on the lam. Garrow follows Stokes to Cuba, where he finally catches up with him. In a spectacular fight sequence, Garrow beats Stokes senseless and sends him back to prison.   With Stokes behind bars, Garrow can finally start rebuilding the police force and clean up New York City.

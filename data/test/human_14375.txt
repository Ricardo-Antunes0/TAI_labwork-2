ProMax is a chemical process simulator for process troubleshooting and design, developed and sold by Bryan Research and Engineering, Inc. Initially released in late 2005, ProMax is a continuance of two previous process simulators, PROSIM and TSWEET.  ProMax is considered the industry standard for designing amine gas treating and glycol dehydration units. Program History In 1974 Bryan Research and Engineering (BR&E) began developing simulation software for sulfur recovery units with a command-line interface.  In 1976 this program was released under the name SULFUR.  Amine sweetening, for which BR&E is most well known, was added in 1978 and the simulation package was renamed TSWEET.  A second product, DEHY, was released in 1980 for modeling glycol dehydration units.  Natural gas processing was added to the DEHY program in 1983 and the package was renamed PROSIM.  In 1988 BR&E introduced a graphical user interface to both programs, a novelty for chemical process simulators at the time.

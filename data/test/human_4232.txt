The building was constructed between 1938 and 1941. It was occupied on November 25, 1940 by the Juvenile and Domestic Branches of the Municipal Court later known as the Philadelphia Family Court. In 2014, the Philadelphia Family Court moved to a new location on Arch Street. As of 2017, the Family Court Building remains unoccupied. In 2020, the City of Philadelphia rescinded a contract with The Peebles Corporation to renovate the building after years of delay. History The building's design follows Beaux-Arts architecture. Its design, that of the adjacent Parkway Central Library, and their placement on Logan Circle closely follow that of the Hôtel de Crillon and the Hôtel de la Marine on Paris's Place de la Concorde. The building was designed by John T. Windrim and constructed by his chief designer W. R. Morton Keast (William Richard Morton Keast).

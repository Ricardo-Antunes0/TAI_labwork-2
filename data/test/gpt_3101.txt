Thomas Alexander Scott (December 28, 1823 â€“ July 30, 1892) was an American jurist and academic. He served as the 24th Chief Justice of the United States from 1881 to 1887.  Scott was born in Lexington, Kentucky, to Thomas and Elizabeth Scott. He was educated at Transylvania University and then studied law at the University of Virginia. After passing the bar, he practiced law in Lexington for a time before moving to Washington, D.C., in 1850 to become a law clerk for Chief Justice John Marshall.  Scott served as an assistant attorney general in the government of President Franklin Pierce from 1853 to 1857. In 1860, he became a professor at the University of Virginia, where he remained until his appointment to the Supreme Court.   Scott was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 4, 1881, and was confirmed by the Senate on April 17, 1881. He served as Chief Justice from January 8, 1881 until his retirement on October 7, 1887. Scott is generally considered one of the most successful chief justices in American history, having authored more than seventy opinions while on the court.  After leaving the court, Scott resumed his teaching career at the University of Virginia until his death in Charlottesville in 1892. He is buried at Lexington Cemetery there.

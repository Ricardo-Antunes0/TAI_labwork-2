Multicultural marketing (also known as ethnic marketing) is the practice of marketing to one or more audiences of a specific ethnicity—typically an ethnicity outside of a country's majority culture, which is sometimes called the "general market."  Typically, multicultural marketing takes advantage of the ethnic group's different cultural referents—such as language, traditions, celebrations, religion and any other concepts—to communicate to and persuade that audience. Cultural and Ethnic variation in multi-cultural societies such as the United States provides marketers with the opportunity to connect with consumers by developing consumer segments for targeted marketing initiatives.  For example, insight into to the culture and ethnicity of consumers is applied directly to consumer targeting through a variety of marketing initiatives in the U.S. Cultural and Ethnic variation in multi-cultural societies such as the United States provides marketers with the opportunity to connect with consumers by developing consumer segments for targeted marketing initiatives.  For example, insight into to the culture and ethnicity of consumers is applied directly to consumer targeting through a variety of marketing initiatives in the U.S. Multicultural marketing acknowledges differences in perception, motives and beliefs among consumers with different cultural backgrounds, utilises cultural norms of several cultures to maximise exposure of the business's product or services by demonstrating interest and appreciation of different cultures (De-Mooij, 2015). For a multicultural marketing strategy to succeed, cultural differences must be identified, understood, and respected. Businesses must communicate on different "wavelengths" and adapt to different markets around the world (Wilkinson & Cheng, 1999).

The Saint Hubert Altarpiece was a late-15th century altarpiece created for the Church of Saint Hubert in Liège, Belgium. It is one of the largest and most important works of the Northern Renaissance. The painting is richly decorated with scenes from the life of Saint Hubert, and is one of the few surviving examples of late medieval altarpiece art.  The Saint Hubert Altarpiece was commissioned in 1487 by the guilds of Saint Hubert, a patron saint of archers and hunters. The guilds had been created in 1384 to support the poor and needy, and it is likely that the altarpiece was intended as a memorial to deceased members of the guilds. The painting was completed between 1496 and 1502, and remained in Liège until 1832. Between 1835 and 1843, it was transferred to Paris, where it remains on display at the Louvre.

The Stourbridge Lion was a railroad steam locomotive that operated in the United States from 1887 to 1937. It was the heaviest locomotive ever built when it was constructed, and is still the heaviest locomotive ever used in regular service.  The Stourbridge Lion was designed by George Stephenson and built by the Vulcan Foundry in 1887. It was the first locomotive to be built with a smokeless steam engine, and its design helped to advance locomotive technology. The Stourbridge Lion operated on the Union Pacific Railroad until 1937, and was retired from service after it failed a safety inspection. It was later donated to the Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, Missouri, and is now on display at the museum's locomotive shed.

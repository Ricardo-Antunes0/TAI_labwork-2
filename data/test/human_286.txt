Hypertrophic Osteodystrophy (HOD) is a bone disease that occurs most often in fast-growing large and giant breed dogs however, it affects medium breed animals as well and has been found in Australian Shepherds. The disorder is sometimes referred to as metaphyseal osteopathy, and typically first presents between the ages of 2 and 7 months.   HOD is characterized by decreased blood flow to the metaphysis (the part of the bone adjacent to the joint) leading to a failure of ossification (bone formation) and necrosis and inflammation of cancellous bone.  The disease is usually bilateral in the limb bones, especially the distal radius, ulna, and tibia. The Weimaraner, Irish Setter, Boxer, German Shepherd, and Great Dane breeds are heavily represented in case reports of HOD in the veterinary literature, but the severity of symptoms and possible etiology may be different across the breeds.  For example, familial clustering of the disease has been documented in the Weimaraner, but not in other breeds.   The disease in the Weimaraner and Irish Setter can be particularly severe, with significant mortality observed in untreated dogs.  The classical age of onset is typically 8 to 16 weeks of age, with males and females equally affected.

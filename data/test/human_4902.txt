With the release of second single "Aa Bali Habibi", the song experienced immense success and is considered to be Elissa's signature song. Background In 2004, Elissa signed to Saudi-based entertainment group Rotana Records and released her fourth album titled "Ahla Dounya" and her fifth titled "Bastanak" in 2006; both garnering World Music Awards (in 2005 and 2006 consecutively) due to their commercial success. Her previous album Ayami Beek was released in December 2007 to moderate success. In August 2008, Elissa announced her intentions to travel to Egypt to meet and work with songwriters for her then-upcoming album on Rotana's tabloid news. Elissa collaborated with composers such as Nader Abdullah, Marwan Khoury, Mohammed Rahim, Jad El Rahbani and Tamer Ali. She enlisted Tamim, Walid Shiraki, Claude Shalhoub, Michel Fadel, Jad El Rahbani and Naser El Assaad as music arrangers. The cover of the album was shot by photographer Matthias Clamer on location at Pena National Palace in Sintra, Portugal. Clamor photographed Elissa for two of her previous albums.

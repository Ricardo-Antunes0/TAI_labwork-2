The Michniów massacre occurred on 12–13 July 1943 in the village of Michniów during German occupation of Poland when approximately 204 of its inhabitants, including women and children, were massacred by a German Ordnungspolizei, SS. During World War II, the inhabitants of Michniów actively cooperated with the Polish resistance movement, in particular with the Świętokrzyskie Home Army units commanded by lieutenant Jan Piwnik, pseudonym "Ponury" ("Grim"), a cichociemny ("Silent Unseen" special-operations paratroopers of the Polish Army in exile in SOE). On July 12, 1943, a German military unit partially burned the village and murdered over 100 inhabitants. In retaliation that same night, Piwnik's partisans attacked the express train Kraków-Warsaw in the area of Podłazie, Skarżysko County, killing or injuring at least a dozen Germans. The next day, German Ordnungspolizei returned to Michniów, completely burning the village and murdering almost all Poles who lived there. In total, at least 204 people,, p. 15 including men (mostly burned alive), 54 women and 48 children,, p. 15 as many as ten of them were less than 10 years old, were victims of the massacres in Michniów. The youngest victim was a nine-day-old Stefanek Dąbrowa, thrown by a German military policeman into a burning barn. Occupational authorities forbade the reconstruction of the village and cultivation of surrounding fields. After the war, the Michniów massacre became a symbol of German crimes committed in Polish villages. Currently in Michniów there is the Mausoleum of Polish Rural Martyrology.

Choe Je-u, who used the pen name Su-un (18 December 1824 – 15 April 1864), was the founder of Donghak, a Korean religious movement which was empathetic to the hardships of the minjung (the marginalized people of Korea), opposed Catholicism and its association with western imperialism and offered an alternative to orthodox Neo-Confucianism. The latter was the ideology of the Joseon Dynasty government; it supported the status quo; and was ineffective in stemming abuses by local officials and the spread of Catholicism. He combined Korean shamanism, Daoism, Buddhism and spiritual Neo-Confucianism in an “original school of thought”. He did not have a concrete nationalistic or anti-feudal agenda, rather: “His vision was religious, and his mission was to remind his countrymen that strength lay in reviving traditional values.” Nevertheless, Joseon authorities confused his teachings with Catholicism;  and he was executed in 1864 for allegedly preaching heretical and dangerous teachings. His birth-name was Choe Je-seon ("save and proclaim"). During his childhood, he was also called Bok-sul ("blissfully happy"). He took the name Je-u ("saviour of the ignorant") in 1859. His disciples called him Su-un ("water cloud"), which was the name he used for his writings, and also called him Daesinsa, the great teacher. His pen name Su-un is used hereafter.

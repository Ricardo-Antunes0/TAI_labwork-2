The Llandoger Trow is a historic public house in the town of Llandovery, Carmarthenshire, Wales. It is a Grade II* listed building.    The pub was built in 1770 by Abraham Darby, who also built the nearby Darby's Mill. The pub is named after Llandovery Castle, which was formerly located on the same site. The pub became a popular stopping point for travellers on the Aberystwyth-Llandovery road.   The pub closed in 1989 but was reopened as a hotel in 2003. It is now run by the Landlord and Tenant Association of Wales.

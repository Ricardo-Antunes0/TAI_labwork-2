An object is a philosophical term often used in the context of ontology and epistemology. In ontology, an object is a type of entity, and in epistemology, an object is something that can be known. In both cases, objects can be contrasted with subjects.  In philosophy, an object may be understood in different ways. For example, it may be viewed as a thing in itself (e.g. a rock), or as a thing that exists in relation to other things (e.g. a person). It may also be viewed as an abstraction (e.g. justice), or as something that cannot be directly experienced (e.g. time).  In general, the philosophical use of the term "object" reflects the various ways in which it is used in philosophy. For example, some philosophers consider objects to be fundamental constituents of reality, while others view them as secondary and derivative aspects of reality.

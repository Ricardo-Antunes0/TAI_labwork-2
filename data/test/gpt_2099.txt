The Miss Utah USA competition is the American state pageant that selects the representative for Utah in the Miss USA pageant.  The Miss Utah USA pageant is the oldest state pageant in the United States. The first pageant was held in 1909 and was known as the "Beauty Contest of the West". The current title was adopted in 1951.   The pageant is open to women who are residents of Utah or have been previously crowned Miss Utah USA or who have won a state title in an event recognized by the Miss America Organization or its predecessor, the National American Miss Association. Prior to 2001, participants must be U.S. citizens.   The winner of the Miss Utah USA pageant is often chosen as one of the finalists for Miss America, but has never won the crown. Two former Miss Utah USA titleholders, Moriah Jefferson and Lauri Peters, both competed at Miss America 2016 but did not place.   Since 1951, eighty-eight women have been crowned Miss Utah USA. Ten of these women have also been crowned Miss America: Barbara Barrett (1951), Carole Mason (1953), Gwen Patterson (1957), Marjorie Gould (1962), Mona Freeman (1966), Madeline Smith (1971), Dee Dee Myers (1975), Trish Goff (1979), and Monique Alexander (1992).   The current titleholder is Savana Shields of Logan, who was crowned on June 3, 2018.

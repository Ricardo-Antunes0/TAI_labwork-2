The Aston Martin Bulldog, styled by William Towns, was a limited production sports car built by Aston Martin in 1963.  The Bulldog was a radical departure for Aston Martin – a two-seater sports car with a V8 engine. It was designed to provide Aston Martin customers with an affordable and accessible way to experience the company’s prestigious brand.  Only 141 Bulldog cars were ever produced, making it one of Aston Martin’s rarest and most iconic models. Today, the Bulldog is considered a highly collectible car.

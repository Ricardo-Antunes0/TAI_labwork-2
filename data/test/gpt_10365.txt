CSS Rob Roy was a Confederate blockade runner during the American Civil War.   Born in 1833 in present-day Alabama, Rob Roy was the son of a Scottish fur trader. In 1859, Rob Roy joined the Confederate Navy as a blockade runner, using his father's contacts to break the Union blockade of Confederate ports. He was particularly successful at smuggling goods into Wilmington, North Carolina, and other important Confederate ports.  In 1864, Rob Roy was captured by the Union Navy and sentenced to death. However, he escaped and made his way back to Confederate territory. He was eventually recaptured and imprisoned in a Union prison on Blackwell Island in the Chesapeake Bay. In 1865, he was paroled and returned to his home in Alabama.  Rob Roy died in 1868 at the age of 43. He is buried in the Old Gray Cemetery in Scottsboro, Alabama.

The Quibéron mutinies were a series of mutinies that took place in the French Navy fleet at Quibéron in 1791. The mutinies were a result of hard economic times and harsh conditions aboard the ships, as well as dissatisfaction with the leadership of Admiral Joffre.   The mutinies began on 17 September 1791 and lasted for six weeks. They were ended on 27 October 1791 after a bloody battle between the mutineers and the French navy. The mutineers were suppressed and about 250 men were executed. The events of the Quibéron mutinies greatly affected French naval morale and significantly contributed to the outbreak of the French Revolution two years later.

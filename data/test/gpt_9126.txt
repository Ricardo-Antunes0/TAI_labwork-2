John Nathan-Turner (12 August 1947 – 1 May 2003) was an English television and film producer. He is most famous for his work as controller of the BBC from 1990 to 1999.  Nathan-Turner was born in Westminster, London, the son of Lilian (née Bower) and John Nathan-Turner, a property developer. He was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge where he read history. After graduating in 1969 he worked as a researcher for the Conservative MP Enoch Powell.  In 1970 Nathan-Turner joined the BBC as a trainee producer. He rose through the ranks to become Controller of BBC2 in 1990, a post he held until his resignation in 1999. During this time he championed the channel's bid for television licence fee funding, which led to its eventual re-privatisation in 1997.

In 2000 he created the factual television series The History of Britain for BBC Two. He died from cancer in 2003 at the age of 55.

Backtesting is a term used in modeling and trading to describe the process of running historical simulations of investment scenarios to assess the potential profitability of proposed strategies.  Backtesting is a technique used in financial modeling and trading to assess the potential profitability of proposed strategies by running historical simulations of investment scenarios. Backtesting can be used to identify undervalued or overvalued assets, to estimate the profitability of trading strategies, and to identify market inefficiencies.  Backtesting can be performed on a single simulated investment scenario, or on a series of simulated investment scenarios that are averaged together to create a "simulated market" or "simulated portfolio". Backtesting can also be used to improve performance estimates for proposed trading strategies by identifying mismatches between expected returns and risk exposure.

In distributed computing, a shared snapshot object (SSO) is an object that is used to represent a view of a subset of the data stored in a distributed system. SSOs are typically created during system initialization or when the state of the system changes, and are then used to provide consistent copies of data to multiple nodes in the system.  SSOs have a number of benefits over traditional replication techniques, including reduced replication overhead and improved fault tolerance. They can also be used to reduce the amount of data needed to be stored in the system, or to improve performance by allowing updates to be made to only a subset of the data.

George Shelvocke (baptised 1 April 167530 November 1733) was an English physician and naturalist.  Born in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, Shelvocke attended Wadham College, Oxford, where he was awarded a BA in 1697. He became a physician in London, where he wrote a number of medical texts. He also became interested in natural history, and travelled widely to collect specimens for his collections.  Shelvocke is most noted for his work on molluscs, which he published in several volumes between 1705 and 1733. His work on the gastropods included descriptions of new species and revisions of existing taxa. He is also credited with coining the term "conchology" to describe the study of molluscs. Shelvocke died in London.

Bastard Swordsman, also known as Reincarnate Swordsman, is a style of swordsmanship that was popular in the medieval China. It is a form of chuan (swordplay), which encompasses all styles of swordsmanship, and is the only style that focuses on barehanded fighting techniques.  The Bastard Swordsman was created by Zhang Sanfeng, who is considered the father of Chinese swordsmanship. His method emphasizes quick, powerful attacks that are aimed at the opponent's vital organs. Zhang Sanfeng believed that a skilled swordsman could defeat even the strongest opponent by using simple techniques and hard work.  Bastard Swordsman techniques are fast and furious, and rely heavily on movement and evasion to avoid being hit. The style is also known for its heavy use of weapon throws and joint locks.

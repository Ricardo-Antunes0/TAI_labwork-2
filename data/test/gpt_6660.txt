The Cassiar Connector is a highway traffic tunnel in the Canadian province of British Columbia. The tunnel is located in the Cassiar Mountains, about midway between the town of Cassiar and the little known community of Gold Rush.  The Cassiar Connector was constructed between 2006 and 2009, and is designed to reduce congestion on the Trans-Canada Highway between Kamloops, British Columbia and Fort Nelson, British Columbia. The tunnel is long and wide, with a total cost of $375 million. The tunnel has a maximum capacity of 10,000 vehicles per day.

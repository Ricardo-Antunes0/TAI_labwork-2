Middle Francia or the first state of the Frankish kingdom was established in the late 4th century. It was ruled by the Merovingian dynasty, which had been founded by Clovis I in 496. The state was divided in two parts in 649, following the Battle of Tertry. The northern part, which became known as Austrasia, continued to exist until the death of Charles Martel in 751. The southern part, which became known as Neustria, continued to exist until the death of Pepin the Short in 784.  Middle Francia was an important region for the development of the French language and culture. It was a major source of kings for the Carolingian dynasty, and also gave rise to some of the Carolingian literati, such as Alcuin and Rabanus Maurus. Middle Francia also played a significant role in the founding of the Benedictine order.

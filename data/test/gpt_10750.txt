Tasmania v Commonwealth, is a landmark decision in the Australian Constitutional Law which determined that the Australian federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over matters of defence and foreign affairs. The case was heard by the High Court of Australia in 1972, and determined that the Australian Constitution does not allow for a concurrent system of government between the Commonwealth and the States.  The case has long been seen as a key victory for the Australian federal government, which had long argued that it should have exclusive jurisdiction over defence and foreign affairs. The decision has also been seen as a key victory for the Australian Commonwealth Constitution, which had long been seen as weaker than the Australian Constitution's counterpart in the United States.

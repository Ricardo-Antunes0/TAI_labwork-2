Keith Eugene Wells (May 11, 1962 â€“ January 6, 1994) was an American murderer convicted of the 1990 murders of John Justad and Brandi Rains in Boise, Idaho. He was executed in 1994 by the state of Idaho at the Idaho Maximum Security Institution via lethal injection, only one year and nine months after having been sentenced to death by Judge Gerald Schroeder. Wells was the first person to be executed in Idaho since 1957, and only the tenth since Idaho gained statehood. He chose not to appeal the death sentence, although it was appealed on his behalf. The United States Supreme Court rejected an appeal filed against his wishes. Early life Keith Eugene Wells was born on May 11, 1962, in Moab, Utah, the sixth of eight children born to Paul and Loral Wells. He was raised in Pocatello, Idaho, by his family, who were close-knit Mormons. Wells started experimenting with alcohol and cigarettes from the age of 4, and was smoking pot by the age of 10 or 11. Court reports showed Wells got in trouble at grade school, where he got into fighting and truancy. He also stole money and household items from family and friends.

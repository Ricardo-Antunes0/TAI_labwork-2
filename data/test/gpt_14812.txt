Upstream is an independent oil and gas newspaper published in Calgary, Alberta. It is the only oil and gas newspaper in Canada that is independently owned and operated.   Upstream was founded in 2001 by a group of oil and gas executives who saw a need for a resourceful, independent news outlet to provide critical analysis of the industry. The publication has since become known for its incisive coverage of the upstream sector – from exploration to production – as well as its insightful interviews with industry leaders.   Upstream is also known for its strong investigative streak, which has led it to probe some of the largest energy scandals in Canadian history. The paper has been particularly outspoken on environmental issues, championing initiatives such as the adoption of the United Nations Global Compact.   Today, Upstream is read by oil and gas professionals across North America, and its website is one of the most popular sources of news and insights about the upstream sector.

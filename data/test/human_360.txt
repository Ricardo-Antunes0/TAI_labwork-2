Ryde Arena (previously ‘Planet Ice Isle of Wight’) was an ice rink in Ryde, Isle of Wight, England. It was opened in 1991 and had a capacity of 1,000 spectators. The venue was the only ice rink in Isle of Wight, functioning as home ice to the Wightlink Raiders of the National Ice Hockey League (NIHL), in addition to a minimum of four synchronized skating teams and a number of figure skaters. Closure In September 1999, the Isle of Wight Council agreed to grant Planet Ice an 125 year lease for Ryde Arena in exchange for £600,000, with the obligation to run the property as an ice rink for fifteen years and to carry out £800,000 of improvements. Planet Ice took over operation of Ryde Arena in February 2001, renaming it Planet Ice Isle of Wight. During 2011–2013, Planet Ice went into administration, resulting in the Ryde Arena leasehold changing hands several times and a sublease for the building being created. On 1 December 2014, the Ryde Arena lease was sold for £1,000,000 to AEW UK.

The geology of Alderney includes similarities in its rock to the neighbouring Normandy and Guernsey. Although Alderney is only five kilometers long, it has a geological history spanning half of the life of the earth.  It is part of the Armorican Massif. Geological history Relics of sediments appear as xenoliths in granites.  However the earliest dated rock is the grey coloured Western Granodiorite from  in the Paleoproterozoic.  As its name suggests it is found in the west end of Alderney.  The xenoliths in it are dark ellipses that demonstrate that the rock has been squashed.  This granite in turn was intruded by the Telegraph Bay Granite in the southernmost part of the island.  This granite contains 50 mm feldspar crystals.  Aplite veins continued from the same magma.  The final stage of intrusion was a microgranite forming many dykes.  Feldspar in the pink microgranite is only 2 mm big.

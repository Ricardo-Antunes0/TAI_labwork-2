Fircroft College is a specialist adult residential college based in Selly Oak, Birmingham, England.  The college was founded by George Cadbury in 1909 and offers over 150 short residential courses throughout the year, most of which last three days. Fircroft was founded with a strong ethos of social justice which continues to this day, with many learners coming to Fircroft with no or few prior qualifications. The short course programme covers subject areas such as English, Maths, ICT, Gardening, Personal and Social Development, Counselling and Mentoring. These courses are aimed at helping adults improve their skills and confidence and work towards reaching their own personal or work goals. The college also runs a number of professional short courses  and qualifications aimed at adults working or involved in the voluntary and community sectors. As well as the short course programme, there is a 30-week Access to Higher Education programme for adults wishing to progress to university - this course has non-residential as well as residential places available.

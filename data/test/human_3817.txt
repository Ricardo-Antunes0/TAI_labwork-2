The Daffodil Festival is a regional festival and royalty leadership program.  The Grand Floral Parade is held in Pierce County, Washington every April. It consists of a flower parade and a year-long royalty program to select a festival queen from one of the 23 area high schools. Each year, the Royal Court spend thousands of hours promoting education, community pride and volunteerism in the county.  In 2012, the Royal Court was named the "Official Ambassadors of Pierce County" by the County Executive and the Pierce County Council. History The Daffodil Festival came into existence because of the bulb industry between 1922 and 1925.  It followed a severe infestation of ‘hop lice’ that destroyed the area’s hop crops and Prohibition.  The US Department of Agriculture recommended bulb planting to Valley growers because of the mildness of the climate and ideal soil conditions. The climate conditions of the Puyallup River Valley produce blooms about 2-3 weeks earlier than other areas, in plenty of time for the mid winter markets.   The area quickly became the nations  ‘bulb basket’ producing 50% of the nations daffodil bulbs, over 50% of its bulb iris and 80% of the nations tulips. About 300 of the 12,000 varieties of daffodils were grown in the Valley. The most popular and most locally grown is the King Alfred.

He was the son of Menasseh ben Abraham Aboab, a well-known rabbi of Hamburg.  Rabbi Abraham Aboab was born in Hamburg in 1711. He studied at the yeshiva of Rabbi Nathaniel Meyerson in Amsterdam, and then at the rabbinical school of Rabbi Yitzchak Luria in Prague. Upon completing his studies, he returned to Hamburg and began to serve as rabbi there. He remained in that position for more than forty years, until his death in 1778.  Rabbi Abraham Aboab was a prolific author. His most well-known work is the commentary on the Babylonian Talmud known as the "Aboab commentary". He also wrote a number of other works, including responsa, homilies, and philosophical essays.

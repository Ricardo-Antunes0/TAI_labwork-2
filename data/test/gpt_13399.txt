Sefer Refuot  (, "The Book of the Dead") is a book of the Hebrew Bible that is sometimes considered to be the first book of the Jewish Bible. It is also considered to be one of the five books of Moses.  The book is composed of a series of narrative poems, each describing the journey of a particular group of Israelites through the wilderness to Mount Sinai. The book concludes with the death of Moses and his followers at Mount Sinai.  The title "Sefer Refuot" is derived from the Hebrew phrase "Shem HaRefuah" (), meaning "The Book of the Covenant".

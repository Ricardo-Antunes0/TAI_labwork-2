The Fulton Opera House, also known as the Grand Opera House, is a historic opera house located at Fulton in Oswego County, New York. It was built in 1847 and is a two-story, masonry and cast iron building with a hipped roof. It features an elaborate entrance featuring a large semi-circular arch flanked by Ionic columns. The interior features a lavish plaster and marble decoration.  The Fulton Opera House was originally built as the headquarters for the Republican Party in Oswego County. In 1881, it was converted into an opera house and reopened under the name of the Grand Opera House. The theater has been used for both stage productions and concerts since its reopening. In 1949, it was renamed the Fulton Opera House in honor of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had been President of the United States at the time of its conversion. The theater has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1978.

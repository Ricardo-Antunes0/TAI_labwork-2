The Malaysian language (, Jawi: ) or Malaysian Malay , is the name regularly applied to the standardized form of Malay language used in Malaysia (as opposed to the variety used in Indonesia, which is referred to as the "Indonesian" language). Constitutionally, however, the official language of Malaysia is stated as "Malay", but the term "Malaysian" or bahasa Malaysia is used on official contexts from time to time. Malaysian is standardized from the Johore-Riau dialect of Malay. It is spoken by much of the Malaysian population, although most learn a vernacular form of Malay or another native language first. Malay is a compulsory subject in primary and secondary schools. Status Article 152 of the Federation designates Malay as the official language. Between 1986 and 2007, the official term bahasa Malaysia was replaced by "bahasa Melayu". Today, to recognize that Malaysia is composed of many ethnic groups (and not only the ethnic Malays), the term bahasa Malaysia has once again become the government's preferred designation for the bahasa kebangsaan (national language) and the bahasa perpaduan/penyatu (unifying language/lingua franca). However, both terms remain in use. The language is also referred to as BM, or simply Bahasa.

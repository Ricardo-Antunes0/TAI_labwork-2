Mandy Martin (18 November 1952 â€“ 10 July 2016) was a Scottish journalist and broadcaster.  Martin began her career as a reporter with the "Edinburgh Evening News" in 1972. Eleven years later, she became the first woman to present a daily news programme on BBC Scotland, when she took over the slot formerly occupied by Ian Stewart.  In 1990, she left BBC Scotland to become a freelance journalist and presenter. She worked for various UK broadcasters, including BBC Radio 4, BBC Radio 5 Live, and ITV's "This Morning". In 2006, she took up a position as a columnist for "The Observer", where she wrote a weekly column until her death.  Martin was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in early 2016, and died two months later at the age of 68.

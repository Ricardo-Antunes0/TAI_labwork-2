Edward Gurney Vaux Evans (September 3, 1907 â€“ September 4, 1990) was an American architect and educator.  Born in Chicago, Evans attended the University of Michigan, where he was a member of the Chi Phi Fraternity. After serving in the United States Army during World War II, Evans returned to Michigan to earn his bachelor's and master's degrees in architecture. He then worked for the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill before establishing his own practice in the early 1950s. Evans taught at Yale University from 1954 until his retirement in 1978. He was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 1984.  Evans is best known for his prolific work as an architect of college campuses, most notably at Yale University (where he served as Dean of the School of Architecture from 1964 until 1978) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (where he was appointed Dean of the School of Engineering in 1968). He also designed numerous public buildings, including the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Minneapolis City Hall.

Diptericin is a 9 kDa  antimicrobial peptide (AMP) of flies first isolated from the blowfly Phormia terranova. It is primarily active against Gram-negative bacteria, disrupting bacterial membrane integrity. The structure of this protein includes a proline-rich domain with similarities to the AMPs drosocin, pyrrhocoricin, and abaecin, and a glycine-rich domain with similarity to attacin. Diptericin is an iconic readout of immune system activity in flies, used ubiquitously in studies of Drosophila immunity. Diptericin is named after the insect order Diptera. Structure and function  Diptericins are found throughout Diptera, but are most extensively characterized in Drosophila fruit flies. The mature structures of diptericins are unknown, though previous efforts to synthesize Diptericin have suggested Diptericin in Protophormia terraenovae is one linear peptide. Yet Drosophila melanogaster's Diptericin B peptide is likely cleaved into two separate peptides. Synthesis of Diptericin in vitro found activity of the full-length peptide, but independently synthesizing the two peptides and mixing them does not recapitulate Diptericin activity. Diptericin A activity is strongly tied to residues in the glycine-rich domain.

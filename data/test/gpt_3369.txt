Flagfall or flag fall is a common term in the United States military for when an enemy flag is lowered from a flagpole or flagstaff as a sign of submission or defeat.  The term is most often used in the context of battle, where it signifies the end of hostilities. It can also be used metaphorically to signify the end of any situation, period, or era.

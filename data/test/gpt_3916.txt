Christian E. Loeben (* 22 December 1961) is a German-born physicist and mathematician, who is the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Professor at the University of California, Berkeley.  Loeben was born in Berlin, Germany. After receiving his diploma in physics from the University of Heidelberg in 1984, he moved to the United States to attend UC Berkeley, where he received his doctorate in 1987 under the supervision of Michael Green. After postdoctoral work at IBM Research, he was a faculty member at UC Berkeley from 1990 until 2002, when he was promoted to John Simon Guggenheim Professor. He has since been a visiting professor at several universities, most recently at ETH Zurich.  Loeben's research focuses on the theory and application of mathematical physics, particularly on problems in gauge theory and string theory. His work has notably addressed questions such as the existence of a superstring theory vacuum state with certain particular properties, the stability of extremal black holes, and the origins of mass and phase transitions.  In addition to his scientific work, Loeben is also known for his writing and lecturing. He has written several books, including a popular textbook on mathematical physics (now in its fifth edition), and is an active public speaker on physics topics. He has also made contributions to popular science writing, most notably his book The Elegant Universe: Superstrings and the Search for a Theory of Everything (2000).  Loeben was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society in 2002

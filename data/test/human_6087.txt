The Ngcobo Police Killings took place on 21 February 2018; five police officers and an off-duty soldier were shot and killed by armed gunmen, who stormed into a police station in the small town of Ngcobo, in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Three days later, police authorities traced the suspects to a local church called the Seven Angels Ministry, a compound the local authorities soon learned doubled as an isolationist cult that encouraged underage girls to have sex with the church leaders as a tribute to God. The police raid resulted in a shootout, killing seven people within the compound, some of whom the police believed to have orchestrated the shooting at the local precinct three days earlier. Seven Angels Ministry The church was established in 1986 by Siphiwo Mancoba in Umzimkhulu, Kwazulu Natal. It was initially called Angel Ministry, an acronym for All Nations God's Evangelical Lamp Ministry. Mancoba recorded most of his teachings, distributing them among his subordinates. They were then tasked with spreading his "word" from village to village, thus creating a recruitment system which encouraged people to come to him for salvation.

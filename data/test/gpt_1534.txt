The Rann Government was the state executive of the planet Rann during the years prior to the year 3000 of the Galactic Republic.  The Rann Government was established in 3010 following the conclusion of the Rann-Thark War. The government was led by Supreme Chancellor Satine Kryze and consisted of a Dictator, a Prime Minister, and a cabinet. The Dictator was Ziro Desilijic Tiure, while the Prime Minister was Satine Kryze herself. The cabinet consisted of ministers responsible for different areas of government.  The Rann Government faced many challenges during its tenure, including the growing influence of the Hutts and the Empire, as well as the emergence of new threats such as the insect-like Killiks. However, the government also managed to make significant progress in areas such as education and infrastructure development. In 3006, Satine Kryze was elected as the first female Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic.  In 3024, Ziro Desilijic Tiure was assassinated by his own son, Thane Desilijic Tiure. This led to a period of instability in the Rann Government, with several ministers vying for power. In 3029, Thane Desilijic Tiure was eventually successful in ousting his father's rivals and establishing himself as the new Dictator of Rann.  In 3039, Thane Desilijic Tiure was assassinated by his own son, Jaster Mereel.

The flag was first used in 1833, during the Peninsular War.  The Spanish flag is one of the most popular in the world. It is also one of the oldest national flags in the world, dating back to the time of the Iberian Union. The banderas monumentales are flown at all public institutions and buildings in Spain, as well as on Spanish naval vessels.

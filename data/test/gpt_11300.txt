Radio Golf is a play by American playwright David Mamet. The piece was first published in The New Yorker on March 5, 1989.  Radio Golf is a one-act play set in a golf course, and revolves around the game's most infamous malcontent, Howard Hughes. The play opens with Hughes on the tee of the first hole, struggling to hit his ball. As he takes his stance, the voice of his ex-wife Sue comes over the radio (via static) and tells him that she has married another man and is moving away. Hughes collapses in tears, hitting his ball into the water hazard.  The rest of the play is largely a dialogue between Hughes and his caddie, Ben; Ben tells Hughes that he has been playing golf since he was a child and has never seen anyone as unhappy as Hughes. Hughes argues with Ben about everything from the quality of his clubs to the rules of the game, until finally collapsing again after hitting his ball into the water hazard once more. Ben tells him that it doesn't matter how bad he hits his ball - it will always go into the water because Hughes is a "radio golfer".

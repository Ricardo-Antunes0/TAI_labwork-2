Michael Gleason is an American musician, singer, songwriter and record producer, best known as the lead singer, pianist and primary songwriter of the rock band Michael Jackson's Thriller. In a career spanning over 30 years, Gleason has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He has also won multiple Grammy Awards, including the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006.  Gleason was born in Brooklyn, New York City, to Jewish parents. His father was a tailor and his mother was a seamstress. Gleason began playing the piano at age four, and after several years of informal lessons with a variety of teachers, he took formal piano lessons from Sylvia Fine at the age of eight. Gleason's first public performance took place at a talent show at his school when he was 12 years old. He formed his first band in high school with classmates and played covers of rock and roll songs at local clubs.  Gleason's breakthrough came when he met music producer John McClain in Los Angeles while he was working on demos for a solo album. McClain helped Gleason get signed to A&M Records, and Gleason released his self-titled debut album in 1982. The album peaked at number 20 on the "Billboard" 200 chart and spawned the hit singles "Hit Me With Your Best Shot" and "I'll Be There" (the latter of which won him a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance).

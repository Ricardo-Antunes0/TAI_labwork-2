Ctenopoma is a genus of climbing gouramies found in Southeast Asia.  The genus Ctenopoma contains six species of tropical climbing gouramies. All six species are found in Southeast Asia, with one species being found in the Philippines and another being found in Borneo. These gouramies are generally small, with slender bodies and long tails. They have strong claws on their toes that they use to climb trees or other structures.  These gouramies are generally active during the day, but they are also known to be nocturnal. They feed on insects and other small creatures that they find in the trees or on the ground.

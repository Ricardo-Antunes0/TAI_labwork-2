German submarine U-960 was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II.  U-960 was laid down on 2 September 1941 at the Blohm & Voss yards in Hamburg, launched on 18 March 1943, and commissioned on 26 May 1943 under the command of Kapit√§nleutnant Joachim Schellenberg. She served with the 4th U-boat Flotilla from 26 May 1943 to 4 October 1944.  After training with the 4th U-boat Flotilla, U-960 sailed from Kiel on 4 October 1944 for her first combat patrol, a stint that would take her to the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea and the North Sea. She sank two Allied vessels before returning to Kiel on 24 December 1944.  U-960 was transferred to the 10th U-boat Flotilla for a second combat patrol on 1 January 1945. She succeeded in sinking one more Allied vessel before returning to Kiel on 11 February 1945.  She was decommissioned on 15 March 1945 and struck from the Naval Register on 7 April 1945. She was sold for scrap in October 1946.   German submarine U-960 played an important role in Germany's war effort during World War II by sinking several Allied vessels, earning her the nickname "U-boat Killer".

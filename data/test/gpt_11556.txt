The NMBS/SNCB Type 64 was a class of steam locomotive operated by the Belgian National Railway Company (NMBS/SNCB) between 1927 and 1963.  The Type 64 locomotives were a development of the NMBS/SNCB Class 59 locomotives. They had a larger boiler and were equipped with superheaters and a Belpaire firebox. The Type 64s were the first steam locomotives in Belgium to be fitted with automatic lubrication systems.  The Type 64s were mainly used on suburban and regional services, but they also saw service on long-distance routes. Some of the Type 64s were rebuilt in the early 1960s to dual power with diesel engines. The last Type 64 was retired from service in 1963.

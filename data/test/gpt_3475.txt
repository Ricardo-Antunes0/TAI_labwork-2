Calochilus holtzei, commonly known as the ghostly orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to the states of Queensland and New South Wales in Australia.  The ghostly orchid is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single leaf at the base of the stem. Up to twelve pale green flowers with darker green stripes are borne on a spike tall. The dorsal sepal is erect, the lateral sepals are spread apart, and the petals are joined at their base to form a hood or "galea" over the column. The labellum is white, greenish-white or yellow and has a long yellow spur. The flower was first formally described in 1810 by Nicholas Hill and the description was published in "Transactions of the Linnean Society of London".  The ghostly orchid is found in Queensland and New South Wales. Its habitat includes rainforest and other moist forests.

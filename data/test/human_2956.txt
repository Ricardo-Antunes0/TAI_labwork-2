He is known for his successful career as a coach, building the Iranian national volleyball team into an international contender. Throughout his career, he managed all national Iranian volleyball teams, including the youth, junior, and senior teams, helping many young players develop their skills. Personal life Karkhaneh was born on May 24, 1959, in Jalilabad, Pishva, to a religious family. He was the third of four brothers. His father was a clergyman, a profession that his youngest son followed as well. He attended Golbon Elementary School in Jalilabad where he played both soccer and volleyball. Due to his athletic abilities and interest in sports, he was actively recruited by local coaches to play volleyball, basketball, football, ping pong, and track and field. His participation in so many sports left him with little time to recuperate between games. He believes that this caused the many injuries he experienced during his professional playing career. His future father-in-law, Gholamhossein Afshinfar, became his volleyball coach and inspired him to pursue the sport. Karkhaneh has two sons and a daughter, who are all involved in sports. His youngest son and his daughter both play volleyball, while his eldest son plays soccer for Saba Qom F.C. and Paykan F.C.

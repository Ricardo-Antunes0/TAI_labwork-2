On January 17, 2020, 16 year-old Colin Jeffrey "CJ" Haynie allegedly shot and killed his mother and three siblings and injured his father in Grantsville, Utah. The incident was the deadliest mass shooting in Utah since the 2007 Trolley Square shooting that killed six including the gunman, and Grantsville's first homicide in nearly 20 years. Familicide  Police told reporters that Haynie allegedly shot and killed his mother and 12-year-old sister first at around 1:00 pm and waited to attack the others when they arrived home. They were shot multiple times in their heads, necks, and upper bodies. His 15-year-old sister was killed sometime after she arrived home between 2:00 and 5:00 pm, and was shot multiple times as well.

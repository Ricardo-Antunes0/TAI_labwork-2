Charles Joseph Krebs   (born 17 September 1936) is a professor emeritus of population ecology in the University of British Columbia Department of Zoology. He is also Thinker-in-residence at the Institute for Applied Ecology at the University of Canberra, Australia.  He is renowned for his work on the fence effect, as well as his widely used ecology textbook Ecology: The Experimental Analysis of Distribution and Abundance. Research Krebs was interested mostly in smaller mammal ecology and in 1965 conducted an experiment on voles. He fenced in an area of grassland in an Indiana pasture about the size of a soccer field and observed what happened to the population of voles living inside the fenced area. This was when he founded the widely known "Fence Effect". Within a year of living in the fenced area the voles had increased by about five times, which is much more than they would in an unfenced area. He then observed that the population experienced a crash, just like the unfenced populations do. Krebs believed this was due to social behaviour among the voles and could be applied to other animals like them. The voles had no place to migrate therefore the final crash seemed to stem from an increase of competition, aggressive behaviour, and decreased resources.

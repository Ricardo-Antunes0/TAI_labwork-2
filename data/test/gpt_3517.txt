John Brayne (c. 1541 – June 1586) was a Welsh linguist and scholar who is best known for his work on the Welsh language.  Brayne was born in the town of Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, Wales, to parents Richard and Margaret Brayne. He studied at Jesus College, Oxford, and obtained his MA in 1567. He then worked as a tutor in the family of Sir Hugh Owen, Baronet. In 1576 Brayne was appointed Professor of Welsh at the University of Cambridge, where he died in 1586.  Brayne's main work was on the Welsh language, which he studied extensively and was able to produce a good understanding of. He also wrote on other topics such as Latin grammar and poetry. His work "A New Grammar of the Welsh Language" (1585) became a standard reference work on Welsh grammar.

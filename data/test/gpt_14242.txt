Celestial cartography, uranography, astrography or star cartography   refers to the art and science of mapping the positions   and movements of celestial objects, principally stars and planets.  Celestial cartography is the study of creating maps or charts of stars and planets, including their positions, motions, and distances. It is used in navigation and astronomy. Celestial cartography can also be used to create models of the universe.  The development of celestial cartography began with early explorers who were looking for new routes to distant lands. Maps of the night sky were used by sailors to find their way at sea. Later, maps were used by astronomers to study the stars.

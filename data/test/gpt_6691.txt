The Wherry Block, also known as Wherry's Row, is a street in the City of London. It runs from Aldersgate Street in the east to Cornhill in the west, and from Fenchurch Street in the north to Ludgate Hill in the south.  The street was built in the 12th century as a series of alleys running between the churches of St Botolph without Bishopsgate and St Michael le Querne. It was originally known as Wherry's Row because it was inhabited by wherrymen who took goods downriver to London. The name was later changed to Wherry Block because it contained several brick buildings used as warehouses.  The street has been largely unchanged since the 15th century, and is now a busy commercial street. It contains numerous restaurants, caf√©s, and shops, as well as several churches. The Wherry Block is listed on the National Heritage List for England.

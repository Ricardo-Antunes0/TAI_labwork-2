The Atrisco Land Grant (merced) of 1692, was a Spanish land grant in present-day Atrisco, New Mexico.  The Atrisco Land Grant was granted to Diego de Vargas and his associates on February 17, 1692 by the Viceroy of New Spain, Antonio de Mendoza. The grant encompassed present-day Atrisco and all of what is now Bernalillo County, New Mexico. The grant was for a period of twenty-one years and required the settlers to establish a permanent settlement within three years.   The grant was one of the largest in New Mexico at the time and allowed for the development of large cattle ranches. The first settler to arrive on the grant was Juan Pacheco in 1692. By 1700, there were about sixty people living on the grant. The population increased rapidly after that and by 1800 there were over one hundred people living on the grant.   In 1824, the Mexican government passed a law known as the Reglamento de las Leyes de Tierra (Regulation of the Laws of Land) which required all land grants greater than fifty hectares to be divided into smaller plots. This led to the subdivision of the Atrisco Land Grant into several smaller grants.

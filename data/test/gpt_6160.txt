Bayuvi Dupki–Dzhindzhiritsa , also spelled Doupki–Djindjiritza, is a town in the Gori Province of western Georgia. It is located on the left bank of the Rioni River, at the entrance to the Likhi Gorge.   The town is named after two historic figures, Bayuvi Dupki and Dzhindzhiritsa. Dupki was a feudal lord in the medieval period, while Djindjiritsa was a medieval Georgian queen. The town was founded in 1687 by a group of people who had fled from the neighboring village of Tskhinvali during the Russo-Georgian War of 1806–1812.   The town is home to Bayuvi Dupki Monastery, which is one of the oldest monasteries in Georgia. The monastery has a history that goes back to the 5th century AD.

Konstantin Dmitrievich Vorobyov (Константи′н Дми′триевич Воробьё′в; September 11, 1886 – May 21, 1938) was a Russian writer, playwright, and short story writer. Vorobyov is considered one of the most important writers of the Russian Symbolist movement.  Konstantin Vorobyov was born in 1886 in Rostov-on-Don, to a merchant family of Ukrainian descent. In 1904 he graduated from the Law Faculty of Saint Petersburg State University and worked as a lawyer. In 1912 he published his first story, "The Caucasian Chalk Circle".  In 1915 Vorobyov met Vladimir Mayakovsky at a party and they became friends. In 1916 Vorobyov published his first book of poems, "The Book of Illusions". He also collaborated with Mayakovsky on the journal "Work".  In 1917 Vorobyov was drafted into the army and served on the Eastern Front. After the October Revolution he was imprisoned for several months. In 1921 he left Russia for Paris and stayed there until 1926.   In 1927 Vorobyov returned to Russia and settled in Moscow. He continued to write poetry and novels, but his works were not well received by critics at first. His best-known novel is "The Real Life of Sebastian Fyodorovich Kuzmich" (1928), which tells the story of a self-destructive artist in late 19th century Russia.   Vorobyov died in 1938 in Moscow after a long illness.

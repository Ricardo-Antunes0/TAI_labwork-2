The Aloha Bowl was a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) college football bowl game that was played from 1967 to 2002. It was discontinued because of the Bowl Championship Series.  The Aloha Bowl was first played on January 1, 1967, and was originally known as the Hawaii Bowl. The game was initially played at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii, and featured teams from the Pac-8 and the Big Ten conferences. In 1978, the game was moved to Las Vegas, Nevada and renamed the Las Vegas Bowl. From 1990 to 2002, the game was played at Autzen Stadium in Oregon, and was renamed the Autzen Bowl after Nike founder Phil Knight donated $3 million to the game's foundation.   The Aloha Bowl's final season was played on December 26, 2002, at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu. The game featured teams from the SEC and the Big 12 conferences. The game was won by Oregon State over Boise State, 42-14.

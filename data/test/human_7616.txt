In graph theory, a rook's graph is a graph that represents all legal moves of the rook chess piece on a chessboard. Each vertex of a rook's graph represents a square on a chessboard, and each edge represents a legal move from one square to another. The same graphs can be defined mathematically as the Cartesian products of two complete graphs or as the line graphs of complete bipartite graphs. Rook's graphs are highly symmetric, having symmetries taking every vertex to every other vertex. In rook's graphs defined from square chessboards, more strongly, every pair of vertices is symmetric to every other pair at the same distance (they are distance-transitive). For chessboards with relatively prime dimensions, they are circulant graphs. With one exception, they can be distinguished from all other graphs by the numbers of triangles each edge belongs to and by the existence of a -cycle connecting each nonadjacent pair of vertices.

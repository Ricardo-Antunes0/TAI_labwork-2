The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is the national meteorological center of the United States. Established in 1947, it is a division of the National Weather Service (NWS). The NHC is responsible for monitoring tropical cyclones in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific oceans. It also provides storm information to emergency management officials throughout the United States.  The NHC was originally known as the Hurricane Center, but this was changed to its current name in 1978. The center is located in Miami, Florida, and has an operational budget of $123 million annually. As of November 2008, the center had tracked 54 Atlantic hurricanes, 26 of which were major hurricanes (category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale). It has also monitored 27 storms in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, including 19 major hurricanes. In addition to providing hurricane information, the NHC also issues advisories on severe thunderstorms, winter storms, and drought conditions.

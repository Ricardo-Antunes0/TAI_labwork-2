Also known as a "perfume lamp", "effusion lamp" or "scented oil lamp", a fragrance lamp is a decorative oil lamp designed to emit a pleasant scent.  The earliest known fragrance lamps were created in the early 18th century, and were used primarily as an aid to relaxation and sleep. They were usually filled with scented oil, and were housed in ornate glass or metal containers or jars.  Today, fragrance lamps are still popular as decorative pieces, and are often used as part of a home's fragrance system. They are also popular as gifts, and can be found in many souvenir shops and department stores.

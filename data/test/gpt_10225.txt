Mary Jones World  is a small, private island off the coast of Georgia that is owned and operated by Mary Jones. The island is home to a vacation home, a nature preserve, and a vineyard.  Mary Jones World is located just offshore from the town of Brunswick, Georgia. The island is accessible by boat or plane, and consists of two main areas: the main residence where Mary lives with her husband, and the nature preserve where she retreats to spend time with her animals and plants.  The island has been in Jones' family for three generations, and she has been interested in preserving it since she first saw it as a child. She began purchasing the land in 1984, and has since added to it through purchases and donations from friends and family. Today, Mary Jones World is a sanctuary for animals, plants, and people.

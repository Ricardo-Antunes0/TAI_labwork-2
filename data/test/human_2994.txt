Alexia Gonz치lez-Barros Gonz치lez (7 March 1971 - 5 December 1985) was a Spanish Roman Catholic child. Gonz치lez-Barros studied in school in Madrid and in her childhood received a papal blessing from Pope John Paul II during her trip to Rome. But in late 1984 she began feeling pains in her arm and back that led to a diagnosis two months later as being a malignant tumor in the vertebral column transforming into spinal cancer. Her siblings and friends remembered her for her piousness and her dedication to practicing holiness in all aspects of life. In 2008 a controversial film was released depicting her life and death; the director maintains that it was a fictional tale that did not depict Gonz치lez-Barros even though it was dedicated to her and drew on some aspects of her life. Her siblings and Opus Dei railed against the film for its perceived slander and inaccuracies that were "unjust".

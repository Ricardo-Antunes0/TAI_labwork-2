Pierre Youssef El Daher (, born 4 October 1957) is a Lebanese businessman and the CEO of the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation International (LBCI) television. Business life Pierre El Daher has helped build the Arab TV industry from its fledgling beginnings almost 30 years ago to the large and growing sector it is today. His vision was born in the early 1980s when he pioneered the concept for the first private Lebanese TV station, which he hoped would bring entertainment and information to people around Lebanon and eventually the Arab World. It was under this vision that the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation (LBC) was launched in 1985 setting the standards for professionalism in the Lebanese TV industry. Pierre El Daher's vision, however, did not stop with the Lebanese market and LBCI soon rose to become a regional and international broadcasting powerhouse, beaming its programming into homes across the region, European Union, United States, Canada, Americas and Australia as part of its satellite station LBC SAT. As LBCI continued to grow, El Daher expanded the station's team to become one of the most talented groups of producers, presenters, reporters and creatives in the region, joining together with partners such as Al-Hayat and Rotana to offer the most-watched programming in the Arab world. El Daher also launched in 1997 production house PAC ltd, which was created to become an in-house production laboratory, and remained chairman and CEO until 2011. By the end of 2008, it was decided to increase the capital by a large margin. Accordingly, Al Waleed Bin Talal became the largest shareholder as he won the absolute majority in PAC and LBC SAT provided that the increase in capital would be invested to improve the programs network and upgrade productivity. In 2010, Rupert Murdoch joined the group and thus PAC and LBC SAT; however, the cooperation did not improve and develop the group. PAC was liquidated in 2012.

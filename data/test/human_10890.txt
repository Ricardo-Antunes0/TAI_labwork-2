The HIV Legal Network (formerly the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network) is Canada's leading advocacy organization working on the legal and human rights issues raised by HIV and AIDS. The organization actively promotes the human rights of people living with and vulnerable to HIV and AIDS, in Canada and internationally, through research and analysis, advocacy and litigation, public education, and community mobilization. The organization was founded in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in 1992, by human rights lawyers Ralf JÃ¼rgens, David Patterson, David Thompson, and Norman Halde. It is currently located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Issues  Unjust laws and policies and violations of human rights continue to worsen the impact of HIV and AIDS. The Legal Network's mandate focuses on ensuring that the human rights of people living with and affected by HIV and AIDS are respected, protected, and fulfilled; and that Canadian and international laws and policies facilitate HIV prevention efforts, as well as care, treatment, and support for people living with HIV and AIDS. While the Legal Network is based in Canada, their work extends around the world, wherever human rights are threatened, including the rights of LGBTQ people. Recently, the Legal Network launched a new fund, the Caribbean Can Rainbow Fund, to benefit this important work in the Caribbean. The organization's research, analysis, education, and advocacy touches on a range of issues: Aboriginal Communities, Access to Medicines, The Caribbean, Criminalization, Discrimination, Drug Policy, Immigration and Travel, Income Security, LGBTQ Rights, Prevention Technologies, Prisons, Privacy, Sex Work, Testing, Women's Rights, Russia, and Rights.

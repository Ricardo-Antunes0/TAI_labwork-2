Mossville is an unincorporated community between Peoria and Bloomington in western Illinois. It is near the junction of Illinois Route 64 and Illinois Route 47, about 16 miles southwest of Bloomington.  Mossville was first settled in 1836, when a group of Mormons from Nauvoo, Illinois, crossed the Mississippi River and established a settlement they called Liberty. The community was renamed Mossville in 1839 after George Moss, an early settler who built a store there. By the 1840s, Mossville had a post office, school, and several businesses. The population declined after the Civil War, and by the 1920s it had only a few families living there. Mossville was abandoned by the 1970s.

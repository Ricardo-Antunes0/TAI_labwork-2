In 1935, she moved to Paris to study at the Académie Julian and became one of the first Mexican artists to exhibit there.  Eulalia Guzmán returned to Mexico City in 1939 and began teaching at the San Carlos Academy of Art. She also continued to exhibit her work throughout Mexico and Europe. In 1974, she was awarded the National Prize for Arts and Sciences. Eulalia Guzmán died on May 10, 1985 in Mexico City.

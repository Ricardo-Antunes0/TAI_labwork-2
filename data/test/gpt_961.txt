Old Scatness is an archeological site on the island of Shetland, Scotland. It consists of a series of early Iron Age brochs and fortifications, and is one of the most significant traces of early medieval life on the islands.  The site is situated on a promontory overlooking the bay of Scatness, which was a major trading and fishing port in the Viking Age. The brochs and fortifications were constructed between the late 8th and early 9th centuries AD, during the reign of King Alfred the Great. They are thought to have been used as a defensive stronghold by the Norse settlers who founded Shetland in the 8th century.  The site has been excavated over a period of more than fifty years, and has yielded a wealth of archaeological evidence relating to the early medieval period on Shetland. It is now managed by Historic Scotland as a protected monument.

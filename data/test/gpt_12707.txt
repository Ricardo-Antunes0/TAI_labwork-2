The Anhak Palace was the royal residence of the Thai monarchy from the 18th century until 1932. It is located in Bangkok's Ratchadaphisek district.  The Anhak Palace was originally built in 1782 by King Narai the Great on the site of a temple of the Hindu god Brahma. The palace was used as a summer palace for the king and his court. It was also used as a venue for royal ceremonies.  After the Thai monarchy was abolished in 1932, the palace was abandoned. In the 1970s, it was restored and is now a museum.

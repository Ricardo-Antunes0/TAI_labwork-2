Juárez Law (November 23, 1855) was decreed by the First Mexican Republic, which then governed New Mexico Territory and Arizona. The law allowed for the extradition of criminals to the jurisdiction of their original country, and for the punishment of those who violated Mexican sovereignty.  The Juárez Law has been cited as a key factor in the decline and eventual fall of the First Mexican Republic.

Palmerston Regional Hospital (PRH) is a public hospital in Palmerston North, New Zealand. It is the largest hospital in the region and the largest employer in the city. PRH is managed by Palmerston North District Health Board.  The hospital was opened on 15 September 1984 as a replacement for Palmerston North Hospital which had been in operation since 1907. The hospital was originally envisaged as a regional hospital to serve the whole of the Manawatu-Wanganui region, but due to its rapid growth it now provides tertiary health services to a wider area around Palmerston North.   The hospital has a total of 1,577 beds and employs 2,500 people. It is divided into three main areas: general medicine, maternity and paediatrics, and surgical services. The hospital also has a major research arm which is responsible for developing new healthcare technologies.

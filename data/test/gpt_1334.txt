The Little Rivonia Trial was a South African trial that took place between 1963 and 1964, during the time of Apartheid. The trial was part of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  The trial was conducted in the Johannesburg High Court, and was presided over by Mr Justice Sir Henry Sewell. The defendants were Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Ahmed Kathrada, Andrew Mlangeni and Raymond Mhlaba. The prosecution was led by Mr Justice John Vorster.  The trial focused on the alleged sabotage of a railway line near Rivonia in the Eastern Cape, allegedly carried out by members of the African National Congress (ANC). The sabotage occurred on 16 June 1961, and resulted in the death of two white civilians and the wounding of three others. The defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit sabotage, and with three counts of sabotage.  The defendants were found not guilty on all charges on 3 October 1964. This landmark decision ended the trial and marked a major turning point in the history of South Africa.

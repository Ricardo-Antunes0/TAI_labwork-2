Dankaran Touman was the first son of Naré Maghann Konaté (father of Sundiata Keita, founder and first Emperor of the Mali Empire in the 13th century). He was also the king of Manden prior to the establishment of the Mali Empire. History  Sources suggests that he was very cruel to his paternal half-brother Mansa Sundiata Keita, whom he persecuted. Their father was the king of Mali (Manden). After Naré's death, Dankaran and his mother Sassouma Bereté plotted to kill Sundiata Keita, because they feared that Sundiata would take the throne. To protect her children, Sogolon Conde (mother of Sundiata) abandoned the country with her children and lived in exile. Mandinka oral tradition tells us that it was foretold that Sundiata would be a great king long before he was born. Sogolon lived in exile with her children for several years and during their time in exile, the powerful Sosso king Soumaoro Kanté invaded their country (Niani). Fearing for his life, Dankaran abandoned his subjects and left the country. Messengers were sent by the Mandinka elders to go and look for Sundiata so that he could come back and help liberate the Mandinka people and their country from the powerful Sosso King. His victory at the Battle of Kirina led to the foundation of the Mali Empire.

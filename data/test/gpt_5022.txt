Manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) or fibrosis release surgery (FRS) is a surgical procedure used to release fibrous tissue in the body. It is used to treat a wide range of conditions, including benign and malignant tumors, cartilage defects, and scarring.  MUA is most commonly used to remove large amounts of fibrous tissue, such as from around a tumor or from within a scar. The surgery is also used to release pressure on nerves or blood vessels.  MUA may be performed using general or local anesthesia. General anesthesia blocks the sensation of pain while local anesthesia numbs only the area being operated on.

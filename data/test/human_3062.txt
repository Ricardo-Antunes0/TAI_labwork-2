Necklace (foaled 24 February 2001) is a British, Irish-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. She had her greatest success as a two-year-old in 2003 when she won two of her four races including the Debutante Stakes and the Moyglare Stud Stakes. In the following year failed to win but did finish third in the Beverly D. Stakes and fourth in the Epsom Oaks before being retired from racing with a record of two wins from nine starts in four different counties. She had very little success as a broodmare, producing only one minor winner. Background Necklace is a bay mare bred in England by the Hampshire-based Meon Valley Stud. As a yearling in October 2002, the filly was consigned to the Tattersalls sale and was bought for 600,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Dermot "Demi" O'Byrne on behalf John Magnier's Coolmore Stud organisation. She was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. During her racing career she raced for the partnership of Michael Tabor and Susan Magnier, usually carrying the blue and orange colours of Tabor.

The United Jewish Appeal (UJA) was a nonprofit organization whose aim was to help Jews in need around the world. It was founded in the United States in 1917 and became an international organization in 1939.  UJA was one of the largest Jewish philanthropies in the world, operating in more than 50 countries and providing assistance to more than 1.5 million people each year. The organization was known for its innovative fund-raising techniques, such as the sale of commemorative stamps and the offering of matching grants to donors.  In 1978, UJA merged with another major Jewish charity, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC), to form the United Jewish Communities (UJC). UJC is still a major Jewish charity, operating in more than 25 countries and providing assistance to more than 2 million people each year.

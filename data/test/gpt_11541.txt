In thermodynamics, the Onsager reciprocal relations express the dependence of temperature on pressure in a simple equation. This equation, which was originally derived by Svante Onsager in 1927, is one of the most important equations in thermodynamics.  The Onsager reciprocal relations are a mathematical relation between temperature and pressure that can be used to describe the dependence of temperature on pressure in simple systems. The Onsager reciprocal relations were first derived by Svante Onsager in 1927. They are one of the most important equations in thermodynamics, and they are often used to predict the behavior of thermodynamic systems.

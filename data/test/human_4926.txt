The Lebanese Arab Army – LAA (Arabic: جيش لبنان العربي transliteration Jayish Lubnan al-Arabi), also known as the Arab Army of Lebanon (AAL), Arab Lebanese Army or Armée du Liban Arabe (ALA) in French, was a predominantly Muslim splinter faction of the Lebanese Army that came to play a key role in the 1975–77 phase of the Lebanese Civil War. Origins On 21 January 1976 at the Elias Abou Sleiman Barracks in Ablah, Zahlé District, in the Beqaa Valley, 900 Lebanese Muslim soldiers serving with the 1st Armoured Brigade (a.k.a. the 'First Brigade') refused to fight against their coreligionists of the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) and mutinied under the leadership of Lieutenant Ahmed Al-Khatib, a Tank officer who originally commanded a 40 men-strong armored company in Rashaya, and urged his fellow Muslims to desert. The mutiny quickly spread to other Army barracks and garrisons on the southern part of the Beqaa and the Jabal Amel – including the strategic Beaufort Castle, Rashaya, Aramayn, Marjayoun, Khiam, Nabatieh and Sidon – and within a month, Lt. Khatib had rallied to his cause some 2,000-3,000 soldiers from the First Brigade, well-equipped with heavy weapons (including tanks and artillery). They became the core of the new Lebanese Arab Army (LAA), formally established on 31 January, who promptly went to the side of the LNM – Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) alliance fighting the Christian-rightist Lebanese Front militias on the ongoing Lebanese Civil War, and on 3 February the LAA published its Manifesto which promoted a political program centered on the Arabism of Lebanon, Democratization and secularization.

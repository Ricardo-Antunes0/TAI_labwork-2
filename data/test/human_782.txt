Multiple treatments, like multivalued treatments, generalize the binary treatment effects framework. But rather than focusing on a treatment effect that can take on different values, the focus now is on different types of treatment. One example could be a job training program, where different types of job training are offered to the participants. The case of multiple treatments is relatively difficult to handle, as it can require additional functional form restrictions, especially when addressing the counterfactual or potential outcomes framework.  Nevertheless, the general instrumental variable framework used to analyze binary treatment effects has been extended to allow for multiple treatments.  There are different approaches available to analyze multiple treatment effects. One can think of treatment effects within this framework as the difference in the counterfactual outcomes that would have been observed if the agent faced different general choice sets, with multinomial choices being a natural way to analyze multiple treatments.  More formally, assume there are J options available and the value to the agent of choosing option j is

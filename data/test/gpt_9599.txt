Jean-Baptiste Frédéric Desmarais (1756–1813) was a French-Canadian entrepreneur and philanthropist.  Jean-Baptiste Frédéric Desmarais was born in 1756 in Montreal, Quebec, to a French-Canadian family of modest means. He began his business career as a clerk in a mercantile house, and by the age of twenty had become a successful merchant. In 1784, he married Marie-Suzanne Poitras, with whom he had two children.  In 1788, Desmarais entered into partnership with another Montreal merchant, Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, to establish the North West Company. The company was one of the most successful in Canadian history; by 1810, its assets had grown to more than C$500 million.  In 1802, Desmarais founded the Bank of Montreal, becoming its first president. He also embarked on a number of philanthropic endeavors; among these was the founding of the Royal Victoria Hospital (now the McGill University Health Centre), which he funded entirely from his own resources. He died in 1813 at the age of 63.

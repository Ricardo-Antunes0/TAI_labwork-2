ChƒÅlco  was a complex pre-Columbian Nahua city-state in the Valley of Mexico, located on an artificial island in the northeast corner of Lake Chalco.  Chalco was one of the largest pre-Columbian cities in central Mexico and was perhaps the most powerful city prior to the Aztec arrival. Chalco was known for its fine pottery, goldwork, and stonework. It had a complex social organization with a well-defined hierarchy and an elaborate religious system.  Chalco declined in importance after the Spanish conquest, but it remains an important archaeological site. Today, Chalco is a municipal seat and part of the metropolitan area of Mexico City.

Baltic mythology is the body of mythology of the Baltic peoples, who have inhabited the region since prehistory. The myths and legends of the Baltic peoples are predominantly connected with nature, as are the myths of many other indigenous cultures around the world.  The traditional religion of the Baltic peoples is a mixture of paganism and Christianity. Most Baltic pagans venerate a pantheon of deities that includes elements of Slavic, Germanic, and pre-Christian Baltic traditions. Christian religious beliefs have been strong in the region since the arrival of missionaries in the 8th century. Today, most Baltics adhere to some form of Christianity, although there is a significant minority of followers of traditional Baltic paganism.  Baltic mythology is rich in stories about magic, immortality, and monsters. Some of the most famous Baltic legends include Ragnorok and The Song of Roland.

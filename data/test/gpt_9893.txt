The Chronicle of Moissac (also known as the Chronicle of Saint-Moissac) is an 11th-century French chronicle. It is the only surviving medieval chronicle of its kind, and is also one of the earliest examples of a high medieval book of hours.  The Chronicle of Moissac was written in the early 11th century by a monk named Eudes de Moissac. The chronicle is a history of the Catholic Church in France, and it covers the period from the time of the apostles to the year 1079. The chronicle is particularly important because it is one of the only sources that can be used to reconstruct the history of Languedoc during this period.  The Chronicle of Moissac is currently housed at the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France in Paris.

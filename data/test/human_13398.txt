The Calvin Coolidge House is a historic house located at 19-21 Massasoit Street in Northampton, Massachusetts.  Built in 1901, it is most historically significant as the home of President of the United States Calvin Coolidge between 1906 and 1930, the height of his political career.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 1976. Description and history  The Calvin Coolidge House is located in a quiet residential area west of downtown Northampton, on the east side of Massasoit Street near its junction with Arlington Street.  It is an architecturally undistinguished -story two-family wood-frame structure, with a hip roof and clapboarded exterior.  Stylistically it is basically Colonial Revival, with projecting sections to the rear of each unit, and different porch treatments on each side.  The Coolidge unit, on the left, has a gable-roofed porch supported by round columns, extending partly in front of a project polygonal bay window.  The interior also has some Colonial Revival features, including a fireplace in the front parlor with flanking Doric pilasters.

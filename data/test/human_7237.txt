Ken Dyers (14 July 1922 â€“ 25 July 2007) was one of two founders of Kenja Communication. He served with the Australian Army during World War II. He founded Kenja with his partner, Jan Hamilton, in 1982. In 1993 he was charged with sexual offences against four young girls, but was found not guilty on ten of the 11 counts, with the remaining conviction overturned in 2002. He was again charged with child sexual assault in 2005. The court case received a temporary stay on the grounds of ill health, but Dyers committed suicide before the case could return to court. Early life Dyers was born on 14 July 1922. His father was 54 when he was born. Dyers claimed that his father, Charlie Dyers, was a toddler on Daly Waters station in the Northern Territory where he had become lost in 1872, at the age of three. He further claimed that Charlie was picked up by a drover three years later at the age of six and returned to Daly Waters station, and that he had lived with an Aboriginal tribe in the intervening years. However, there is no record of that event. Daly Waters was named by John McDouall Stuart in his third attempt to cross the continent from south to north in 1862. A pastoral map of the area from 1887 shows that there were no pastoral stations operating in the area of Daly Waters at that time, and the Overland Telegraph station there was not established until in 1872.

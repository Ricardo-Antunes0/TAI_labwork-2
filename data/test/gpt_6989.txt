In Ancient Egyptian religion, Taweret (also spelled Tawaret and Tawaret-Aten, meaning "Greater Aten"), was the goddess of the sea, storms and fertility. She was seen as the mother of the god Horus and was associated with the inundation and fertility of the Nile River. Taweret was also revered as a protectress of women and children.  Taweret is first attested in the Old Kingdom period, during the reigns of Djoser and Unas. She is mentioned in a text from the Pyramid of Djoser as one of the deities who assisted Horus in defeating Seth. Later during the Middle Kingdom, Taweret was often depicted as a woman with a crocodile head or as a woman wearing a cow's headdress. In later periods she became associated with Hathor, as her cult spread to other regions of Egypt.  Taweret remained an important deity throughout the Late Period and into the Ptolemaic period. Her worship continued into Roman times, becoming particularly popular in Lower Egypt. In later periods she was considered syncretic, with elements of her worship found in various other religions. Taweret is still venerated today by some Egyptians and foreigners living in Egypt.

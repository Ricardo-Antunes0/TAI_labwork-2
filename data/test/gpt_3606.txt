Village Kid  (4 December 1980 – after 2003) was an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was one of the most successful horses of his era, winning races including the Arc de Triomphe, Ascot Gold Cup and the Champion Stakes. He was retired in 2002 after sustaining a serious injury in a fall at Newmarket.  Village Kid was a bay horse with a white blaze and four white socks on his hind legs bred in Kentucky by his owner, Sheikh Mohammed. He was sent to be trained in England by Michael Stoute.  He ran fourteen times as a two-year-old, winning seven times including three Group One races – the 2000 Guineas over one mile at Newmarket, the Derby over 2000 yards at Epsom Downs and the St James's Palace Stakes over twelve furlongs at Royal Ascot. On his three-year-old debut he won the Sussex Stakes over one mile at Goodwood Park.  In 2002 Village Kid sustained a serious injury in a fall at Newmarket. He was retired from racing after a final win in the Champion Stakes over thirteen furlongs on his final appearance. Village Kid stood as a breeding stallion in England but had little success with his progeny. He died after falling in January 2003.

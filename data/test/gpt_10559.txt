Stanley Whitehead (1902 – 1956) was a British physicist who made seminal contributions to the theory of quantum mechanics. He is best known for his development of the principle of least action, which is a cornerstone of the classical mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics.  Whitehead was born in 1902 in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, England. After completing his undergraduate studies at the University of Cambridge, he worked as a research student under Max Born at the University of Göttingen. In 1925, Whitehead obtained his doctorate from Göttingen under Born's supervision.  Whitehead spent most of the 1930s working at the University of Cambridge and Imperial College London. In 1936, he joined the faculty at Princeton University and remained there until his death in 1956. During World War II, Whitehead served as a scientific advisor to the British War Office.  Whitehead is best known for his development of the principle of least action, which is a cornerstone of the classical mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics. He also made important contributions to the theory of relativity and statistical mechanics. Whitehead was a founding member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

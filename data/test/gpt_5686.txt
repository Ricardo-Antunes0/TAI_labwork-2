The fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius), also known as the black-and-white fat-tailed lemur or the Madagascar dwarf lemur, is a small diurnal lemur found on the island of Madagascar.  The fat-tailed dwarf lemur is the smallest of all living lemurs. It has a head and body length of 50 to 55 cm, and a tail length of 25 to 30 cm. The fur is black on its back, white on its belly, and has characteristic white stripes on its arms and legs. It feeds mainly on insects but also consumes small amounts of fruit. The fat-tailed dwarf lemur is currently threatened by habitat loss, hunting, and invasive species.

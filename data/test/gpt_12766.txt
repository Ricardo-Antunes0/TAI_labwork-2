Prasterone enanthate, also known as dehydroepiandrosterone enanthate, is a synthetic androgen and anabolic agent. It is a ester of dehydroepiandrosterone and enanthate, and is the C17-alpha-alkylated derivative of dihydroepiandrosterone. It is available in the form of an injectable powder for intramuscular injection.  Prasterone enanthate was initially developed in the early 1990s as a potential treatment for male hypogonadism, a disorder caused by a deficiency or absence of testosterone in the body. It has since been found to have other potential applications, including in the treatment of anemia,cachexia, and frailty. Prasterone enanthate is also used as a doping agent in athletics.

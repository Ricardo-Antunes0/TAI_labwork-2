Sensus fidei (sense of the faith), also called consensus ergo fidei (consensus because of faith), is a term found in the Nicene Creed. It is often translated as "consensus of the faithful" or "faithful consensus".  The term is used to describe the theological principle that all Christians must agree on the basic tenets of their faith in order to be considered part of the same church. This principle is also known as "the law of majority". The Nicene Creed states that "We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all that is in them, and in one Lord Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord," and "We believe in one Holy Spirit, who proceeds from the Father and the Son."

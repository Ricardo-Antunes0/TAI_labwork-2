"Young Girls" is a song by American singer-songwriter Bruno Mars. It was composed by Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine, a songwriting and record production trio known as the Smeezingtons, as well as Jeff Bhasker, and Emile Haynie, with additional songwriter credits by Mac Davis, for Mars's second studio album Unorthodox Jukebox (2012). It is a midtempo, doo-wop-influenced pop ballad that garnered comparisons to Mars's "It Will Rain" and Lana Del Rey's music. Its instrumentation includes drums, synths, piano and elements of electro music. The song was released as the first promotional single and later as the fifth overall single from Unorthodox Jukebox, being first serviced to contemporary hit radio in Australia on November 26, 2013. "Young Girls" received generally mixed to positive reviews. Many music critics noted the complex instrumental and praised Mars's vocals on the record. Its lyrics, detailing the fact of the singer being unable to resist his attraction to young girls, were met with criticism; with reviewers calling it a "recognizing sin" and "impassioned shame". The single was recognized as the Best Pop of 2013 at the MelOn Music Awards. Commercially, "Young Girls" charted in some countries, along with the released of its parent album, such as South Korea, where it reached number one, United Kingdom and Canada. Before it was canceled as the second single it peaked in Australia and New Zealand at 62 and 23, respectively. As the fifth single it reached the position of 19 in Canada and 32 in the United States. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The track was performed live on Saturday Night Live and occasionally on The Moonshine Jungle Tour (2013â€“14).

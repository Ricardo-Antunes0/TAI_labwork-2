Pokuttia, also known as Pokuttya or Pokutia , is a historical area of East-Central Europe, situated between the Dniester and Cheremosh rivers and the Carpathian Mountains, in the southwestern part of modern Ukraine. Part of the Antean tribal alliance since the 4th century, it joined Kievan Rus' in the 10th century, and was eventually annexed by Poland in the 14th century. The region was involved in a series of wars between Poland and Moldavia, which ceased with the death of Petru Rare»ô, who failed to conquer the region on two occasions (1531, 1535). A last attempt to seize Pokuttia was made by John III the Terrible in 1572. At times, Polish rule caused discontent among Pokuttians. Many of them were captured and resettled to Moldavia, where they reinforced the Ukrainian element in the country. In the 1490s, a rebellion was started by Petro Mukha, only to be suppressed by 1492. The region remained under Polish rule until 1772. Although the historic heart of the area was Kolomyia, the name itself is derived from the town of Kuty that literally means 'round the corner' ("Kut" by itself means "corner"). History The accounts of Greek and Roman historians describing the "widespread Slavic settlement" in Pokuttia have been confirmed by archaeological findings.

The Germantown Redoubt (more commonly known as the Fort Necessity National Battlefield) is a historic fortification located in the town of Germantown, on the outskirts of Washington, D.C.  The forts construction began in 1774 and was completed in 1777. The redoubt was an important early defense against possible British advances into the American colonies during the American Revolutionary War. The fortifications provided a safe haven for Continental Army soldiers and their families, as well as a staging area for subsequent attacks on British forces.  In 1814, during the War of 1812, the fort was briefly seized by the British Army under Major General Gordon Drummond. After a brief siege, the fort was recaptured by American forces and remained in American hands until 1815. Today, the fort is open to visitors and is managed by the National Park Service.

The Pool Group were a trio of British pop/rock musicians, comprising keyboardist Andy Duncan, guitarist and singer Warren Haynes, and drummer John "JR" Robinson.  The Pool Group were formed in 1990 in London by keyboardist Andy Duncan and guitarist and singer Warren Haynes. They were initially signed to the independent label Creation Records, but later moved to the major label EMI. The group's debut album, "Loose Ends" (1991), was well received by music critics, who noted their strong songwriting skills and catchy melodies. The album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry. The group's second album, "Different Gear, Same Road" (1993), was even more successful than their first, reaching number one on the UK charts and selling over 300,000 copies.  In 1995, Haynes left the group to focus on his solo career. The Pool Group briefly disbanded before reforming two years later with drummer John "JR" Robinson replacing Haynes. They released their third album, "Slowdive", in 1999 which was met with mixed reviews but again achieved commercial success, reaching number one in the UK charts and selling over 400,000 copies. After the release of their fourth album "Life" (2002), the group disbanded again.  Following the disbandment of the Pool Group, Duncan went on to play keyboards for Oasis from 2003 until their reunion in 2009 and has since played with many other groups including The Raconteurs and Fleet Foxes.

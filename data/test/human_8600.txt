Healing Rooms, officially registered as Healing Rooms Ministries and the Association of Healing Rooms (IAHR) is a nonprofit organization headquartered in Spokane, Washington, United States.  While John G. Lake also started a ministry with the same name and in the same city in 1915, the current organization was founded (also phrased in printed materials as "rebirthed" or "reopened") on July 22 of 1999 by Cal Pierce, who was previously involved with Bethel Church in Redding, California. Standards  All Healing Rooms locations within the organization agree on a statement of faith and adhere to certain safety, privacy and discretion protocols for ministering to individuals through prayer, such as an absolute minimum of two and a preferred maximum of three individuals ministering to a visitor in order to maintain a balance between privacy and accountability. Certain elements are predictable, such as a waiting room with a receptionist and a separate room for ministry. If a location has additional space, they may have multiple rooms dedicated to ministry in order to service a larger number of visitors during a limited span of time. The hours of a Healing Room vary, but it is most common for a location to be open one or more days per week, with a two or more hour block of time, according to people involved in the ministry.

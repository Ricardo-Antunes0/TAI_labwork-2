The 7×64mm (also unofficially known as the 7×64mm Brenneke, though its designer's name was never officially  added as a part of the cartridge name) is a rimless bottlenecked centerfire cartridge developed for hunting. As is customary in European cartridges, the 7 denotes the 7 mm bore diameter and the 64 denotes the  case length. The 7×64mm is a popular hunting cartridge in Central Europe due to its  case head diameter and  overall length allowing it to easily be chambered in the Mauser 98 bolt-action rifle that was once standard German military issue. History At the start of the 20th century the famous German gun and ammunition designer Wilhelm Brenneke (1865–1951) was experimenting with the engineering concept of lengthening and other dimensional changes regarding standard cartridge cases like the M/88 cartridge case, then used by the German military in their Mauser Gewehr 98 rifles, to obtain extra muzzle velocity.

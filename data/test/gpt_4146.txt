Rustling A Bride is a lost  19th century Welsh ballad written in a  primitive form of the Welsh language. It tells the  story of a young man who goes to woo a  bride but cannot win her heart. He instead  seeks to win her hand by performing magic  tricks. The ballad is thought to be about  a courtship between Gruffudd ap Llywelyn and  Gwyneth ap Nudd.  The ballad has been translated into many languages and is popular in both Europe and North America. There are numerous versions, but the most well-known is the English version, which was published in 1892.

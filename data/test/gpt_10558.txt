Revolutionary socialism is a political philosophy, doctrine, and movement that calls for the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with a socialist economic system.  Revolutionary socialists believe that the only way to achieve social change is through a revolution, which is a fundamental change in society. They believe that the working class, or the majority of society who are not wealthy or privileged, can achieve this by overthrowing their exploiters and establishing a new, socialist order.  Many revolutionary socialists also believe in creating a society based on egalitarianism, where all people have the same rights and opportunities. This can be achieved through a variety of means, including revolutionary violence if necessary.

Authenticated Identity Body or AIB is a digital identity management system that provides an online assertion of identity,typically through the use of digital signatures or through the use of biometric data.   Authenticated Identity Body systems are used in a number of applications, such as access control, e-government, and e-commerce. AIB systems can also be used to verify the identity of people who are not online.

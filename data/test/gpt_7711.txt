Llywarch Owain Reynolds (1843 â€“ 12 March 1912) was a Welsh painter, sculptor, and printmaker.  Reynolds was born in 1843 in the town of Aberystwyth, Cardiganshire, Wales and studied at the Royal Academy of Arts, London. His early works were depictions of Welsh landscape and villages, but he soon developed an interest in Romanticism and began to focus on historical and mythological subjects.   He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1864 to 1911, and his work was included in the 1905 London World's Fair. He died in 1912 in London.

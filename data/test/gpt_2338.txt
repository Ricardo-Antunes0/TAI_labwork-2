William C. Mogk (November 7, 1931 â€“ July 7, 2014) was an American chemist and inventor. He is best known for his development of the molecular sieve process, a high-performance chemical engineering technique that is used to separate molecules by their size and shape.  Mogk was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, on November 7, 1931. He received his B.S. in chemistry from Purdue University in 1952 and his M.S. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1954. Mogk then worked as a research associate at the University of California, Berkeley until 1957, when he joined the faculty of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 1965, he became a full professor at Illinois and served in that position until his retirement in 1994.  Mogk's work on the molecular sieve process led to major advances in chemical engineering, including increased production rates for drugs and other industrial chemicals. He also developed new methods for purifying various materials using the molecular sieve process, including rare earths and platinum metals. Mogk was a fellow of the American Chemical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He died on July 7, 2014 at the age of 84 after a long illness.

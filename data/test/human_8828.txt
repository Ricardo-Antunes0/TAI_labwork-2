Plot The movie begins with the heart touching montage "India, the country rich with the most ancient culture in the world. ShriRam, the Maryada Purushottam (The supreme human being with regard to observing the restrictions laid down by the society), and Yogeshwar (The God of Yoga) Shri Krushra took incarnation. The period from 1707 to 1858 was particularly difficult. Anarchy prevailed everywhere. Intrigued by the British policy to divide and rule the states are fighting with one another. Holy men have become pompous and hypocrite to serve their own ends. Unscrupulous people in the disguise of holy men roam everywhere to cheat and loot the people. It is the same land where women were elevated to the status of goddess but now they are subjected to heinous cruelty. In the blind desire to have a son, they drown the girl child in milk immediately after her birth. The evil practice of 'Sati' - a widowed woman immolating herself on the pyre of her deceased husband - has become deep rooted. Chaos and anarchy are all-pervading because of ignorance and lack of spiritual understanding. India awaits a reformer."

Didier Mouron is a Swiss artist (naturalized French in 1995) who has worked in a variety of media, including painting, sculpture, installation and photography. He is best known for his large-scale installation works and for his photography, which often incorporates elements of performance.  Didier Mouron was born in Lausanne on 3 November 1955. After studying at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Geneva, he moved to Paris in 1978 and began working as a painter. He has since exhibited at the Tate Gallery, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), the Centre Pompidou, the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, and other venues around the world. His work often deals with themes of isolation and alienation, and he has been praised for his use of light and shadow to create moods of anxiety or despair.  Mouron's installations have often been described as "grandiose" or "spectacular", and have been seen as experiments in spatial manipulation. His photography is similarly ambitious, incorporating elements of performance into works that often explore the relationship between human beings and technology. In 2014, Mouron was awarded the Swiss National Prize for Art.

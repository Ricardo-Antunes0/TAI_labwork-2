The Engeyjarætt goes back to a married couple, the Engeir Jarls. It is said that the couple were cursed by a vengeful deity, who made the woman barren and the man grow old quickly. The Jarls turned to magic in an attempt to solve their problems, and they eventually became witches. It is said that they used their powers to curse other families as well, and that the Engeyjarætt is a result of this activity.

The Lombardi curse was an alleged sports-related curse that was said to have befallen the Philadelphia Eagles team of the National Football League (NFL). The curse is named after the team's former head coach, Buddy Ryan, who was quoted as saying "The Lombardi curse will be lifted when we win the Super Bowl".  The Eagles have not won a Super Bowl since the 1996 season, which was also the last year that Buddy Ryan was coaching the team. Since then, they have made several appearances in the playoffs but have never won a championship.   The curse is not universally accepted as being real. Some commentators suggest that the Eagles' failures are simply a result of poor luck or bad timing, and that there is no such thing as a Lombardi curse. Others suggest that Ryan's comments were intended to demoralize his opponents and that he actually believed in the curse himself.

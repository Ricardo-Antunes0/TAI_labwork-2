On the island of Trinidad, the Southern Range is the highest mountain range in the country. The range runs parallel to the eastern coast for about 160 kilometers, ending at the northernmost point of the island. The mountains are made up of igneous and metamorphic rocks, and are home to a variety of wildlife, including the Trinidad toucan and the Trinidad mockingbird.

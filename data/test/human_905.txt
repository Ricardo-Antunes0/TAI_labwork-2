The following year D.U. released Sons of the P, which featured the hit singles "Kiss You Back" and "No Nose Job", the latter of which showcased a unique scratching technique that Fuze playfully coined "the bumble-bee scratch", inspired by DJ QBert, and featured prominently in the song's intro. He demonstrated this scratch live at the Apollo Theater in 1992 during a televised performance with Digital Underground.

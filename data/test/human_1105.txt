Langthwaite is one of the few villages in Arkengarthdale, North Yorkshire, England. It is  north of Reeth and sits  above sea level. It is the main settlement in the dale and is one of the most northerly settlements in the whole of Yorkshire Dales National Park. Langthwaite is one of two places in the dale that have houses clustered together closely in a traditional village set up; the rest of the settlements in the dale are populated by scattered buildings. It is home to a pub ('The Red Lion'), a shop and an unusual commissioners' church of 1818, which was one of many then built with money provided by Parliament in an attempt to counteract atheism and free thinking after the French Revolution. Langthwaite is also home to a grade II* listed hexagonal powder house, built in 1807 to store gunpowder used in the many mines dotted around the area.

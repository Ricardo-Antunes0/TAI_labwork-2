Arthur McIntyre (31 October 1945 – 26 October 2003) was an Australian artist and art critic. He was born in Katoomba, New South Wales. McIntyre's early inspiration as an artist was the popular Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio program Argonauts Club. As member "Atropos 30" McIntyre would send in his drawings to the Argonauts program on a regular basis and the program's art critic Jeffrey Smart would be an ongoing source of encouragement. He was awarded the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Commonwealth Art Award by Jeffrey Smart in 1962 during his final year at Katoomba High School. After earning the Dux of Katoomba High School that same year, McIntyre was offered two university scholarships and chose to study at the Alexander Mackie Teachers College, now known as Sydney's National Art School (1963 to 1966). After college, McIntyre taught art in several high schools in Sydney and Canberra before becoming a full-time artist, supplementing his income writing art criticism from 1975. That same year he was awarded a studio at the Cité internationale des arts in Paris.

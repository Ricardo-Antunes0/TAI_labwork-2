Eric Hill  (9 July 1923 â€“ 27 July 2010) was an English first-class cricketer who played for Somerset County Cricket Club as an opening batsman between 1947 and 1951, later serving as captain of the second team, a long-serving committeeman for the county, and as a journalist covering cricket for the local newspaper, the Somerset County Gazette, and correspondent for The Daily Telegraph. In the Second World War, he was a navigator on reconnaissance missions for the Royal Air Force, and was decorated for his courage. Background Hill was born at Taunton, where his parents ran a sweetshop. He was educated at Taunton School, where he was a day boy, and where one of his contemporaries, though a boarder, was the future cricket writer Alan Gibson. In a profile of Hill written in 1983, Gibson wrote: "Although we were much of an age, he was about twice my size." Hill played soccer and cricket for the school: "[He] had a passion for cricket, a quiet but deep passion, and his ambition was to play for Somerset," Gibson wrote.

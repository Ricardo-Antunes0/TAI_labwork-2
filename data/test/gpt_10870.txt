Kendal (1883â€“1908) was an English Thoroughbred racehorse. He was undefeated in eight races, including the Ascot Gold Cup and the Derby. After his running career ended, he became a successful breeding stallion.  Kendal was a bay horse with a white blaze and three white socks on his hind legs. He was bred by William Hill, who sent him into training with John Porter at Newmarket.  Kendal made his racecourse debut in April 1883, finishing third in a maiden race at Newmarket. In October he won the Ascot Gold Cup, beating Lord Derby's colt Warrender by two lengths. In November he took the Derby, beating Lord Rosebery's colt Musket by four lengths.  After winning the Derby, Kendal was retired to stud duty and had a successful breeding career. His best offspring were the winners of many major races including the St Leger, Epsom Derby and Irish Derby. He died in 1908 at the age of 25.

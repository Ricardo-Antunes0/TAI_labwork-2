Guilandina bonduc, commonly known as grey nicker, nicker bean, fever nut or knicker nut, is a species of flowering plant in the senna tribe, Caesalpinieae, that has a pantropical distribution. It is a liana that reaches a length of  or more and scrambles over other vegetation.  The stems are covered in curved spines. Its  grey seeds, known as nickernuts, are buoyant and durable enough to be dispersed by ocean currents. Description Guilandina bonduc grows as a climber, up to  long or as a large sprawling shrub or small shrubby tree.  The stems are irregularly covered with curved prickles. The leaves are large and bi-pinnate, up to  long with scattered prickles on the rachises and blades. There are four to eleven pairs of pinnae,  long with five to ten pairs of pinnules. The pinnules are  long, elliptic, oblong or ovate with acute tips and entire margins. The inflorescence is an axillary raceme, often branched, covered with short hairs and up to  long. The jointed pedicels are up to  long. The sepals are shorter than the petals which are around  long; the petals are yellow, sometimes with a spot of orange near the base of the keel. The flowers are followed by large, flattish, spiny green pods which later turn brown, some , containing one or usually two, glossy, rounded, grey seeds.

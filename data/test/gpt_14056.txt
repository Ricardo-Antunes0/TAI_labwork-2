Nya Fröken Sverige (in English: New Miss Sweden) is a national beauty pageant in Sweden. The pageant is organized by the Swedish Association of Beauty Pageants (Sveriges Könsmaktsällskap) and is the country's official national beauty pageant.  The first Nya Fröken Sverige pageant was held in 1967. Since then, the pageant has been held annually, except for four years, when it was not held due to lack of sponsorship. The current Miss Sweden 2017, Malin Lindholm, is the 57th contestant to win the title.   Nya Fröken Sverige is open to contestants aged 18 years or older who are resident in Sweden at the time of the competition. The winner of Nya Fröken Sverige is selected by a jury of judges, which includes representatives from the Swedish Association of Beauty Pageants, fashion industry professionals and media personalities.   The title of Miss Sweden is one of the highest accolades that can be bestowed upon a female Swedish citizen and has been awarded to numerous recipients over the years, including Zandra Rhodes, Victoria Silvstedt and Jennie Bergström.

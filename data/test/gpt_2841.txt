Email archiving is the act of preserving email messages as text files in an electronic archive. Email archiving can be used to reduce the amount of email that needs to be stored on individual email servers, and to make it easier for users to find and access email messages.  Email archiving is useful for organizations that use email as a communication medium, especially when it is difficult to keep track of which emails have been sent and which have not been sent. Email archiving can also be helpful for legal proceedings in which emails are used as evidence.  Email archiving can be done manually or with the help of an email archiving software program. Manual email archiving involves a technician or administrator going through each email and extracting the text file. Email archiving software programs can automatically scan through all of the email messages and create text files with the information contained within them.

William Odlin (April 5, 1865 â€“ May 25, 1936) was an American bacteriologist who was the first person to isolate and name the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. Odlin was also the first person to develop a vaccine against tuberculosis.  Odlin was born in 1865 in Rochester, New York. He received his bachelor's degree from Allegheny College in 1887 and his doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania in 1892. Odlin began his career at the University of Michigan as an instructor in bacteriology and pathology. In 1895, he moved to the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where he served as an associate professor of pathology until 1907. In 1907, Odlin became the director of the Tuberculosis Sanatorium at Johns Hopkins.  In 1912, Odlin isolated and named the bacterium that causes tuberculosis, which he had been researching for over a decade. He also developed a vaccine against tuberculosis, which he tested on himself and other patients at the sanatorium. Odlin retired from Johns Hopkins in 1928 and died five years later at the age of 79.

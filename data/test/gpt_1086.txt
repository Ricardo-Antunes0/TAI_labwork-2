The U-101 class was a class of submarines developed for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in the late 1930s. The submarines were designed to be fast and efficient patrol boats, capable of covering large areas of open water at high speeds.  The U-101 class was the first true "modern" submarines built for the Kriegsmarine, and was a significant step forward in submarine design. The class was armed with four torpedo tubes and a number of other features that made them highly versatile vessels. However, the U-101 class was not very successful and only a few were ever completed.

Harrison James Holgate (born 1 July 2000) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defender for EFL League One club Fleetwood Town. Career Born in Leeds, Holgate began his career as part of the Manchester United youth academy before being released at U14. He then joined the Middlesbrough youth academy but injury curtailed his U16 involvement which inevitably led to his release. He then joined the Fleetwood Town youth academy on a two year scholarship where in his second year, still only 17, he signed on 10th Feb 2018 a youth loan to Stalybridge Celtic, making 15 appearances, which led to Holgate signing a professional contract with Fleetwood Town on 4 May 2018. A couple months later, on 6 September, Holgate joined Northern Premier League side Stafford Rangers on a youth loan playing nine games, with Fleetwood Town recalling him on 8 October. On 13 October, he signed with National League North side Ashton United. He made his competitive debut for the club that same day against Spennymoor Town, starting the match in a 5â€“0 defeat.

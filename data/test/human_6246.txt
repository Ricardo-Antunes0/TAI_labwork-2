Faisal's only release of 2012 was Abdul Faththaah's romantic film Love Story alongside Ali Seezan, Amira Ismail and Aishath Rishmy. Displeased with the screenplay and performance of the actors, Nadheem of Haveeru wrote: "None of the actors were given scope to build their characters and none was able to justify their character. With excessive emotional scenes, actors were exposed to over-acting and nothing more". The last release of 2010 featured Manik in the drama film Heyonuvaane (2010) which was directed by Yoosuf Shafeeu and starring opposite Shafeeu, Sheela Najeeb and Fathimath Fareela.

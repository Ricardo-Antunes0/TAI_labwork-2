Herbert Thomas Condon (27 February 1912 – 1 November 1988) was an American physicist who made seminal contributions to the theory of nuclear physics and to the understanding of the structure and behavior of matter.  Condon was born in Omaha, Nebraska, on February 27, 1912. After completing his undergraduate studies at the University of Nebraska, he received a Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1935. From 1935 to 1942 he was a research associate at the California Institute of Technology. In 1942 he joined the Manhattan Project, working on the development of the atomic bomb. He served as deputy director of the project from 1945 to 1947, and as director from 1947 to 1953. During this time he also served as chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (1949–53).  After leaving the Manhattan Project, Condon became a professor at Stanford University and then at Columbia University. In 1973 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on nuclear fission and nuclear reactors. He died in New York City on November 1, 1988.

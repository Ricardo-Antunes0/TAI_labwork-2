A Catholic Bible is a Christian Bible that includes the whole 73-book canon recognized by the Catholic Church, including the deuterocanonâ€”a term used by some scholars and by Catholics to denote the books (and parts of books) of the Old Testament which are in the Greek Septuagint collection but not in the Hebrew Masoretic Text collection.  According to the Decretum Gelasianum (a work written by an anonymous scholar between 519 and 553), the Council of Rome (AD 382) cited a list of books of scripture presented as having been made canonical. Later, the Catholic Church formally affirmed their canon of Scripture with the Synod of Hippo (in AD 393), followed by the Council of Carthage (AD 397), the Council of Carthage (AD 419), the Council of Florence (AD 1431-1449) and the Council of Trent (AD 1545-1563) establishing the canon consisting of 46 books in the Old Testament and 27 books in the New Testament for a total of 73 books in the Catholic Bible.

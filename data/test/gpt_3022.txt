The Saxony Mill was a historic textile mill in the town of Saxony, Massachusetts. It was a major employer in the town for over a century, until its closure in the early 1990s.  The Saxony Mill was founded in 1834 by Timothy and Nancy (Nee) Saxony. The Saxony family were originally from Germany, and operated the mill until 1972. In its heyday, the Saxony Mill employed over 300 people.  The mill went through several phases of operation over its lifespan. Initially, it was a textile mill producing cotton yarn. In the 1920s, it began producing synthetic fabrics, including nylon and rayon. The mill also produced woolen goods, such as socks and mittens.  The Saxony Mill closed in 1992 due to the decline in the textile industry. It was later demolished, and replaced by a housing development.

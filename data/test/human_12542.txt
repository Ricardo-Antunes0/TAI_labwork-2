The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) is the sanctioning body for the NASCAR Cup Series, the Xfinity Series and the Camping World Truck Series.  NASCAR also administers a number of regional racing series, including the Whelen Modified Tour, and the Whelen All-American Series, as well as international series in Canada, Mexico, and Europe. Similar to other professional motor racing leagues and sanctioning bodies, NASCAR has been a target of criticism on a variety of issues.  Some critics note the significant differences between present day NASCAR vehicles and true "stock cars".  Another topic of debate has been NASCAR's move to larger markets; in 1997, NASCAR added the California and Texas Motor Speedway, respectively located in the metro areas of Los Angeles and Dallas.  This caused NASCAR to move away from traditional tracks such as Rockingham, which has led to some fans feeling that NASCAR abandoned its core market.

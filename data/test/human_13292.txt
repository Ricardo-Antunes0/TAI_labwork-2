Aubrey S. "Red" Newman (1903â€“1994) was a United States Army major general with 34 years of service. During World War II, Newman commanded the 34th Infantry Regiment of the 24th Infantry Division during the Philippines Campaign. His cry of "Follow Me!" at Leyte rallied his troops and inspired American infantrymen for decades. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC), the nation's second-highest award for valor in combat, for extraordinary heroism during this battle. Newman was a contributor to Army Magazine for many years. His articles on common sense leadership were very popular and were later published in three books: Follow Me: The Human Element in Leadership, Follow Me II: More on the Human Element in Leadership, and Follow Me III: Lessons on the Art and Science of High Command. He also authored What Generals are Made Of. His books remain on the professional reading lists of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, the United States Marine Corps' Commandant, and many other military and paramilitary organizations.

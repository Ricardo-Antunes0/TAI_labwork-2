Krukowski Quarry is a sandstone quarry near Mosinee, Wisconsin. In the late Cambrian period (510 m.y.a), this area was a beach and shoreline, and the quarry is well known for abundant fossil impressions of Climactichnites, Protichnites, and beached jellyfish, Scyphozoan Medusae. Pre-Devonian evidence of this jellyfish is exceedingly rare; this location and one in New Brunswick hold the only known fossils. The fossilized tracks of Climactichnites and Protichnites are also amongst the best preserved examples in the world. No fossilized remains of the either animal exist, making them enigmatic species. The quality and quantity of these fossil tracks in the quarry are extremely valuable to paleontologists. History  Krukowski Quarry was founded in 1978 by Jeff Krukowski in Irma Hill and Blackberry Hill near Mosinee, Wisconsin, and is owned by Krukowski and his wife and children. The Krukowski Stone Company, incorporated in May 1984, manages the quarry. At present, the quarry has over 1,000 acres of quarriable land and possesses 37,000 feet of European sawing equipment. The quarry is known for sedimentary rock slabs used in applications such as countertops.

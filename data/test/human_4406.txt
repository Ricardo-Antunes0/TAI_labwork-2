The 1980 Nepal earthquake devastated the Nepalâ€“India border region on the evening of July 29. The epicenter of the 6.5  quake was located in Nepal, northwest of Khaptad National Park. At least 200 people died and 5,600 were injured in the disaster. Extensive damage occurred on both sides of the border, amounting to 245 million USD (828.9 million in 2022). Tectonic setting The Himalaya is located at the convergent boundary where active convergence leads to continental collision. The India and Eurasian plates began colliding approximately 50 million years ago when the Tethys Ocean closed. The Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT), a decollement structure, defines the boundary between the Indian Plate and Eurasian Plate. The convergent zone also contains three other major faults; the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT), Main Central Thrust (MCT) and South Tibetan Detachment (STD). At the surface, the Main Himalayan Thrust propagates along the Main Frontal Thrust. These faults runs for approximately 2,300 km in an east-west direction, parallel to the southern foothills of the Lower Himalayan Range from Assam, through Nepal, and into Pakistan. This major thrust fault dips to the north, beneath the Himalaya at a shallow angle. It is the source of most of Himalayan earthquakes.

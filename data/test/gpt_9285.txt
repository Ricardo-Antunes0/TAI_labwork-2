The Bulgarian National Front (Bulgarian:Български Национален Фронт, БНФ) is a right-wing political party in Bulgaria.  The party was founded in 1990 by Ivan Kostov, a former member of the Bulgarian Communist Party who had become disillusioned with its policies. The National Front is staunchly opposed to the current government, which it regards as dominated by the socialist party ABV. The National Front has never won a seat in the Bulgarian Parliament, but it has done well in local elections.

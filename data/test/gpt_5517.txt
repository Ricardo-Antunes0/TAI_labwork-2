In molecular biology, hemagglutinin (or haemagglutinin in context of immunity) is a protein which causes red blood cells to attach to each other and to the surface of other cells. Hemagglutinin is produced by some viruses as part of the viral life cycle, and it can also be produced by certain bacteria and parasites. Hemagglutinins are also used as research reagents in the study of cell biology.

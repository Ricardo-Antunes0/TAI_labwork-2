Chalkokondyles or Chalcocondyles , also seen as Chalcosoma , is a genus of large, air-breathing, cartilaginous fish found primarily in tropical and subtropical waters. They are the only extant family of chalcocodiles.  The family Chalkokondylidae contains 21 species in five genera. They are slender, elongated fish with a long snout and a prominent ridge running along the back. They have three pairs of barbels and small eyes set high on the head. The males have elongated genital organs that can be raised to expose their reproductive organs during courtship.  Chalkokondyles are predators that feed on other fish and crustaceans. Some species are capable of leaping out of the water to capture prey.

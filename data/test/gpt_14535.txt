Untuckit LLC (styled as "UNTUCKit" in branding) is an American company that makes and sells a clothing unpicking tool, designed to make it easier for women to remove their shirts without having to take them off.  Untuckit was founded by three friends in 2014, after noticing a lack of clothing unpicking tools on the market. The company has since released two versions of its tool, the original Untuckit and the newer Untuckit 2.0. The Untuckit 2.0 was released in 2017 and has been met with critical acclaim, being called "the best shirt unpicking tool on the market" by The Guardian.  Untuckit has raised over $1 million in funding from angel investors and venture capitalists, including 500 Startups, Canaan Partners, and First Round Capital. The company is headquartered in San Francisco, with a distribution center in Seattle.

The Townley Vase is a large Roman vase dating from the 2nd century AD. It is a earthenware pot with a bulbous body and a sharply pointed spout. The vase was discovered in 1905 in the town of Townley, North Yorkshire, England and is now in the British Museum.  The Townley Vase is one of the most famous Roman artefacts ever found, and has been described as "one of the most beautiful objects ever created by man". The vase is thought to have been used as a funerary urn, and its striking design has been compared to that of the Greek krater.  The Townley Vase is made from red earthenware clay and shows signs of having been fired at an extremely high temperature. The vase was discovered in a field near Townley, which was at that time an isolated Roman settlement. It has been suggested that the vase was made in Italy or Syria, but its true origins remain a mystery.

There have been two baronetcies created for persons with the surname MacLeod (pronounced "MacLoud"), both in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. As of 2014 both titles are extant. The MacLeod Baronetcy, of Fuinary, Morven, in the County of Argyll, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 3 March 1924 for John MacLeod, who had earlier represented Glasgow Central and Kelvingrove in the House of Commons as a Conservative. His grandson, the third Baronet (who succeeded his father), was killed on active service in 1944. He was succeeded by his uncle, the fourth Baronet, George MacLeod. He was a clergyman, one of the best known, most influential and unconventional Church of Scotland ministers of the 20th century, and founder of the Iona Community on the island of Iona. In 1967 he was given a life peerage as Baron MacLeod of Fuinary, of Fuinary in Morven in the County of Argyll. This title became extinct on his death in 1991 while he was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son, the journalist Maxwell MacLeod, the fifth and (as of 2014) present holder of the title.

Ken Dyers (14 July 1922 â€“ 25 June 2009) was an English painter and printmaker.  Dyers was born in Liverpool, the son of a docker. He studied at Liverpool School of Art in 1941, then at the Royal College of Art in London, where he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy Schools. He served in the Royal Air Force during World War II, then worked as an artist's assistant at the University of Surrey until 1957. He then moved to live and work in Cornwall.  Dyers's work is characterised by its use of bright primary colours and a simple, direct style. He is particularly noted for his depictions of rural life and scenes from the English seaside. His prints are in high demand, and he has been awarded several prizes, including the prestigious Royal Society of British Artists' Award in 1978. Dyers died in 2009 at the age of 88

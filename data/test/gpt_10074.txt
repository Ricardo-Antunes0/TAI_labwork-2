The yellow bittern (Ixobrychus sinensis) is a large wading bird of the heron family. It is found in much of Southeast Asia, from southern China to the Malaysian peninsula, and east to Sumatra and Borneo.  The yellow bittern is a large wading bird, with a length of about 110 cm (43 in), and a wingspan of about 1.5 m (5 ft). The male is slightly larger than the female. The plumage is mainly dark brown, with a yellow head, neck, upper breast and flanks. The underparts are whitish, except for a narrow black band around the vent. There are also black spots on the wings and tail.   The yellow bittern feeds on fish, frogs, and other small animals in shallow water. It often stands on one leg to reach prey. It is capable of flight, but usually remains on the ground.

Prince and Great Steward of Scotland are the two most senior titles in the British Royal Family. The Prince of Scotland is first in line to the throne, and the current holder is Charles, Prince of Wales.  The title of Prince of Scotland was created in 1424 for the future James I of Scotland, son of King Robert III of Scotland and his first wife Margaret of Denmark. The title was held by James's grandson, also James I, and then passed through the male line to the eldest son of each succeeding monarch. The title was not accorded to the daughter of a reigning monarch, even if she had a son, until 1952, when Queen Elizabeth II granted her daughter Princess Elizabeth the title upon her marriage to Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.  Since 1707, the heir apparent to the British throne has been styled "Prince of Wales", but under Scots law prior to that date an heir apparent could be styled "Prince of Scotland" without any reference to Wales. The heir apparent's title is now also Duke of Rothesay.

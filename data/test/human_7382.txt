Zytel is a trademark owned by DuPont and used for a number of different high strength, abrasion and impact resistant thermoplastic polyamide formulations of the family more commonly known as nylon. The Zytel product line is based mostly on nylon 66, but also includes grades based on nylon 6 as a matrix, long chain nylons such as nylon 610 (if based on at least one renewable monomer they are branded Zytel RS), and copolymers including a transparent resin called Zytel 330.  Resins based on polyphthalamides are branded 'Zytel HTN'.  The Zytel product range takes advantage of the fact that nylons are one of the most compatible polymers with modifiers and so offers grades  with varying degrees of fiberglass, from 13% to 60%, (to increase stiffness and strength), rubber toughened resins, flame retarded grades. Nylon resins with mineral reinforcement are branded 'Minlon'. Properties The properties of Zytel will vary with the specific formulation.  Formulation  Zytel HTN 35% Glass Reinforced Resin, consisting of 35% glass fiber by weight, has a tensile strength of around 30kpsi and a flexural modulus of 1500kpsi under room temperature conditions.  Zytel also offers good chemical resistance to common chemicals such as motor oil, transmission fluid, and methanol, and shows little thermal expansion.  Other additives or treatments may be used to increase toughness, wear resistance, and temperature tolerance.

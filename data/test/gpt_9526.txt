The Aro-Ibibio Wars were a series of conflicts fought in the mid-nineteenth century between the Aro people and the Ibibio people. The wars were fought over land and resources, and resulted in the displacement of tens of thousands of people.  The cause of the wars is unknown, but they may have been related to the spread of Christianity in West Africa. The wars lasted for more than fifty years and caused great human suffering. In 1865, the Aro-Ibibio Wars concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Paris.

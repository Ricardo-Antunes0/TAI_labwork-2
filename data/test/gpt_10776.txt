The Main Plot was an alleged conspiracy by a group of powerful people to keep the general population uninformed about important events, specifically the JFK assassination.  The Main Plot is one of many conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination of JFK, which remains one of the most widely debated and controversial events in American history. Proponents of the Main Plot theory claim that a group of powerful people – including members of the CIA, the Mafia, and the military – conspired to keep the general population uninformed about important events, specifically the JFK assassination. They allege that this was done to cover up their involvement in the assassination and to maintain power and control over the United States.  While there is evidence to support some aspects of the Main Plot theory, it is by no means conclusive. Indeed, many experts believe that it is simply a variation on other conspiracy theories – such as those surrounding the JFK assassination itself – that have been circulating for decades without ever being proven true. The Main Plot remains an intriguing – but unproven – theory about one of America’s most dramatic and controversial moments.

Domenico ("Dominique") Pino (Milan, 8 September 1760 â€“ Milan, 3 October 1841) was an Italian painter of the Neoclassical period.  He was born in Milan, where he trained with his father, Stefano Pino. In 1784 he won a second prize at the city's annual art competition, and in 1786 finished the decoration of the palace of the Governors of Milan. From 1796 to 1805 he served as director of the Academy of Fine Arts in Milan.  He is chiefly remembered for his paintings of historical and mythological subjects, especially "The Rape of Europa" (1801), "The Battle of Zama" (1806), and "Apollo and Daphne" (1814).

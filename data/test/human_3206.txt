Type 348 radar is a Chinese fire control radar developed for Type 76 twin 37 mm naval gun as CIWS, and it incorporates features of Italian RTN-10X and RTN-20X sold to China in 1992. Type 348 radar is frequently but erroneously confused and misidentified as another Chinese naval radar Type 346 due to the lack of publicized information in the development of the latter. To meet the urgent Chinese naval need of CIWS before the availability of more advanced CIWS such as Type 730 CIWS, Type 348 radar is developed as a stopgap measure by developing a less capable CIWS using Type 76 twin 37 mm guns. The muzzle velocity of twin 37 mm is 1 km per second, and the maximum rate is 800 round per minute, with a range of 3 km. However, early developmental trials have revealed that the original fire control radar Type 342 used proved to be rather inadequate in tracking sea-skimming anti-ship missiles, consequently, Type 348 radar was developed as a replacement, incorporating technologies of Italian RTN-10X and -20X radars purchased in the early 1990s. The 800 round per minute maximum rate of fire of the larger twin 37 mm gun is not sufficient either, when compared to the Gatling gun of smaller calibers used by other CIWS at the time. To increase the firepower, Type 348 radar is designed to control two twin 37 mm gun mounts simultaneously against the same target, thus doubling the volume of fire and increase the probability of kill. Although the CIWS incorporating Type 348 radar and two twin 37 mm gun mounts has proved to be effective against subsonic sea-skimming anti-ship missile flying as low as just four meters above sea level, it nonetheless has been phased out of Chinese service when more advanced CIWS of Gatling design such as Type 730 CIWS became widely available. Another cheaper replacement of CIWS based on 37 mm guns and Type 348 radar is Soviet/Russian AK-630, which is installed on Type 054 frigate.

Héctor José Moreno Moreno (born June 8, 1963 in Ventaquemada, Boyacá) is a retired Colombian racewalker. He went to four Olympic Games and five World Championships in Athletics. He is one of the most successful Colombian athletes of the past fifty years because only one other Colombian also has a Pan American Games title. Another highlight is the permanence of his personal best of 3:52:16 hours (set in 1997) as the national record for more than twelve years. At regional level he was a two-time champion at the South American Championships in Athletics (1983 and 1997), the gold medallist at the 1998 South American Games, the 1990 Central American and Caribbean Games champion, and the 1989 Bolivarian Games winner. He has also won several lesser medals internationally, including two bronzes at the Pan American Games, two silvers at the South American Championships, three silvers at the Bolivarian Games and two bronzes at the Ibero-American Championships in Athletics.

is a retired Japanese artistic gymnast. He is a seven-time Olympic medalist (all-around, team and floor exercise), winning three golds and four silvers, and a twenty-one-time World medalist (all-around, team, floor exercise, horizontal bar, and parallel bars). Uchimura was already considered by many in the sport to be the greatest gymnast of all time after his success at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, but he subsequently solidified his reputation by following up that performance there with additional and uninterrupted victories at every major competition throughout the next Olympic cycle leading up to his individual all-around gold-medal victory at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. He is known for being the first gymnast (male or female) to win every major all-around title in an entire single Olympic cycle, accomplishing this feat twice by winning six world (2009–2011 and 2013–2015) and two Olympic (2012 London Olympics, and 2016 Rio Olympics) individual all-around titles. Uchimura is also the individual all-around silver medalist at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He is known for delivering difficult and accurately executed routines. The International Gymnast Magazine had praised his skills as a "combination of tremendous difficulty, supreme consistency and extraordinary elegance of performance."

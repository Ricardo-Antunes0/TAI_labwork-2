Alex Beaulieu-Marchand (born March 3, 1994) is a Canadian freestyle skier. He represented Canada in slopestyle at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, winning the bronze medal at the latter. Early life Alex started skiing at age 2, he grew up in up in a family of skiers but he was mainly influenced by his grandfather to ski. He downhill skied until he was 12 until he was introduced to slopestyle skiing. He had a friend that skied Slopestyle so he decided to try it out. As a kid one of his favorite hobbies was hockey, he wanted nothing more than to be an NHL player. But his parents were skiers, and they insisted on bringing him to the ski hill because they didn't enjoy sitting in an arena all the time. This quickly developed a love for skiing. He enjoyed knitting too and it was like a job for him at a time. He dreamed of going to Whistler B.C to ski but he and his family couldn't afford it. So he found a way to make money, He knitted hats all summer and sold them eventually gaining enough money to go to Whistler B.C. And 12 years later he spends a lot of time training on those same hills as a part of the Canadian Slopestyle team at 24 years old. His biggest inspiration was his mentor Mehdi, from Algeria.

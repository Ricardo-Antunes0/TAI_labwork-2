The 428th Fighter Squadron is part of the Air National Guard. It is based at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. The mission of the 428th Fighter Squadron is to provide air defense for the United States.  The 428th Fighter Squadron traces its lineage back to the 428th Fighter Group, which was activated in mid-1943 in the United States. The group served in the European Theater of Operations as part of Ninth Air Force. After the war, the group was inactivated in Germany in early 1946.  The squadron was reactivated as a fighter-interceptor unit in 1948 at Hamilton AFB, California. The unit was equipped with F-86A Sabres and deployed to Japan in 1950 where it participated in the Korean War. The 428th rotated between Japan and Korea until late 1952 when it returned to California.  In 1955, the squadron moved to Fayetteville AFB, North Carolina, and began receiving F-100D Super Sabres. In 1958, it was reassigned to Holloman AFB, New Mexico, where it continued to fly the Super Sabres until they were replaced by F-102 Delta Daggers in 1960.   In 1962, the squadron converted to the F-106 Delta Dart and continued to fly them until they were replaced by F-15 Eagles in 1975. In 1992, the squadron converted to the F-16 Fighting Falcon and continues to fly them today.

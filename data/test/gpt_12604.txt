The Personal Software Process (PSP) is a systematic approach to managing software development projects. It is a process model that helps teams to identify, track, and manage the project's product scope, features, deadlines, and resources.  The PSP was developed in the late 1980s by Ivar Jacobson and his team at Rational Software. The model has been widely adopted by software development organizations worldwide.  The PSP is based on the concept of a product backlog, which is a prioritized list of features and tasks that a project needs to complete in order to deliver a product to its customers. The product owner is responsible for creating the product backlog and ensuring that it reflects the stakeholders' needs and desires.  The PSP process consists of five phases: plan, do, check, reflect, and adapt. In the plan phase, the team lays out its goals for the project and establishes baselines for key performance indicators (KPIs). In the do phase, team members work on tasks in the product backlog according to their assigned roles and timelines. During the check phase, team members verify that tasks are completed according to plan and that all KPIs are met. In the reflect phase, team members take stock of the project's progress and make any necessary changes to their plans based on this feedback. Finally, in the adapt phase, team members continue working on tasks in response to changes in the environment or new information that has been learned during the Reflect phase.

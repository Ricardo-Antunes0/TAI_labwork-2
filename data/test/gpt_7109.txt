Bailey Whitfield 'Whit' Diffie (born June 5, 1943) is an American cryptographer who, with Martin Hellman, developed the seminal public-key cryptosystem, Diffie–Hellman.  Whit Diffie was born on June 5, 1943, in Orange County, California. He received his BS from the University of California, Berkeley in 1965 and his MS from the University of Utah in 1967. Diffie then worked at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) from 1967 to 1972, where he worked on cryptography.  Diffie and Hellman developed the seminal public-key cryptosystem, Diffie–Hellman. This system allows two parties to establish a secret key without knowing each other's secret keys. This key is then used to encrypt data using a symmetric-key algorithm. The receiver can then decrypt this data using the same symmetric key. The security of this system is based on the assumption that no party can learn the secret key of the other party without first breaking the symmetric algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt the data.  Diffie has also worked on other cryptography projects, such as the Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) algorithm. He served as president of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) from 1983 to 1984. He currently holds an appointment at Stanford University.

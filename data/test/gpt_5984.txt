Tanngrisnir (Old Norse: , literal meaning "teeth of the dragon") is a giant, serpentine dragon that is the main antagonist in the Norse mythology of the Elder Edda. He is described as having a head of serpents, claws like iron hammers, and a body so massive it could crush mountains. He dwells in the underworld, known as Niflheim.  Tanngnj√≥str (Old Norse: ) is a giant who wields a magical spear called Gungnir. He is one of the valkyries and one of Odin's most renowned warriors.  The two creatures have together inspired many myths and legends, both in Scandinavia and elsewhere in Europe.

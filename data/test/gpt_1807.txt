Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt was a German field fortification on the eastern bank of the River Aa in the town of Bruneck, in the Austrian province of Styria.   Constructed in 1938, it was one of a series of fortifications built in the area to resist an anticipated Italian invasion of Austria. The redoubt was captured by American and British forces on 4 May 1945 during the Austrian Civil War. It was used by the Allies as a prisoner-of-war camp for Germans until it was closed in 1947.   The redoubt has been restored and is open to visitors.

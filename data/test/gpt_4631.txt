Mauritaniaâ€“Senegal relations are the foreign relations between Mauritania and Senegal. Both countries are members of the Arab League and the African Union.   Both Mauritania and Senegal have a long history of ties that date back to pre-colonial times. Senegal was one of the first African countries to recognize Mauritania's independence in 1960 and the two countries have since developed a strong relationship based on shared interests in regional security, economic development, and defense cooperation.  The two countries have cooperated extensively on issues such as peacekeeping operations in the Central African Republic and the Mali intervention, as well as joint military training exercises. They have also worked together to address regional challenges such as terrorism and illegal migration.

Irditoxin is a three-finger toxin (3FTx) protein secreted by the bacterium Irritans toxin-9 (I.T.9). Irditoxin is classified as a type III toxin, which is a family of proteins that bind to and disable voltage-gated ion channels.  Irditoxin was first identified in 1992 and was originally named for the Australian researcher Catherine Irdit who isolated it from a strain of the bacterium I.T.9. Irditoxin is toxic to both human and animal cells and has been used as a model system to study the mechanisms underlying type III toxin toxicity.  Irditoxin binds to voltage-gated ion channels, leading to their destabilization and eventual closure. This process results in the inhibition of nerve cell firing, muscle contraction, and other cellular responses. Because of its widespread toxicity, irditoxin has been used as an agent to study the mechanisms underlying a wide variety of human diseases, including myasthenia gravis, neuromuscular junction disorders, and cholera.

Lepidotes (from  , 'covered with scales') is a genus of snakes in the family Colubridae. The genus contains about 20 species, distributed in Africa, Asia, and Europe.  The genus Lepidotes comprises 20 species of small to medium-sized snakes. All are relatively thin snakes with a moderately broad head. They have well-developed eyes and ears, and a smooth, scaly skin. Most species are brightly coloured, with many variations possible.  Lepidotes are fossorial snakes that live in warm environments, such as under stones or logs. They feed primarily on small rodents and other animals, but some species also eat birds and eggs. Many Lepidotes are highly active snakes that are capable of rapid movements.

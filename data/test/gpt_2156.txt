The Bacan Islands, formerly also known as the Bacan Group, are an archipelago of volcanic islands located in the Philippines. The Bacan Group is situated in the northeastern region of Luzon, approximately 120 kilometers north of Manila. The total land area is 8,821 hectares.  The Bacan Islands are part of the province of Isabela and comprise eight main islands: Baco, Pata, Panay, Sablayan, Sibutu, Tablas and Tumas. The smaller islets are Babeldaob and the uninhabited Pulupandan.  The climate on the islands is generally hot and humid with occasional typhoons. The soils are mostly sandy but some have volcanic origins. The main economic activity is subsistence farming. There are also some small-scale commercial ventures such as coconut production and fishing.  The native inhabitants of the Bacan Islands are the Tagbanwa people who speak a form of Visayan. Christianity was first introduced to the islands by missionaries from Mexico in 1578. The first Spanish settlement was on Baco Island where a church and mission were built.  The Bacan Islands were administered as part of the province of Isabela from Manila until 1959 when they became part of the newly created province of Zamboanga del Norte. In 1971 they were transferred to the newly created province of Basilan which was later abolished in 1991 and they returned to Isabela.  In 2006 the Bacan Islands were included in the newly created province of Muslim

The Congoâ€“Arab War (also known as the First Congo War, the Great War of Africa, or the War of the Congo) was a conflict in Central Africa that lasted from January 15, 1960 to May 25, 1964. It involved eight African countries: Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Spain, Ethiopia, and Uganda. The war was fought by these countries and their proxies against the forces of the Congo Republic, led by President Patrice Lumumba.  The war resulted in the decolonization of the Congo and its partition along ethnic lines. The majority of the population was placed in two independent states: the Republic of Congo in the north and the Democratic Republic of Congo in the south. Rwanda also achieved independence from Belgium during this time.

The Pietà (; ; 1498–1499) is a sculpture by Michelangelo, executed in marble. It is one of the most famous and revered sculptures in the world, and is regarded as one of the greatest works of art of all time.  The sculpture is a nude figure of Mary, with her son Jesus in her arms, on a flat base that has been slightly sunken into the ground. She is facing away from the viewer, toward her Son, and her hands are clasped in prayer. The statue is signed "M.A." (Michelangelo).  The Pietà was commissioned by the Florentine banker Lorenzo de' Medici for his tomb in the Medici Chapel in the Basilica of San Lorenzo. The original cost of the statue was 8,000 florins, of which Michelangelo received 4,000 florins upon completion. In 1527, it was transferred to the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo, where it remains to this day.

Yadaya (, ; from Sanskrit ; variously translated as "friendship", "love", "affection") is a Sanskrit word that is used in Indian philosophy, literature and religions to describe the emotional and spiritual bond between people.  The word yadaya has a range of meanings, including friendship, love, affection, and empathy. In Hinduism, it is one of the five essential elements of a balanced life: yajna (worship), dharma (righteousness), artha (wealth), kama (pleasure), and yadaya. In the context of relationships, yadaya is seen as the glue that holds them together. It is also seen as an essential ingredient in happiness.  The term originates from the Sanskrit word यदि (yadi), meaning "if". According to one theory, yadaya refers to the worry or anxiety one feels in anticipation of the future.

Jennie Thornley Clarke (c. 1866 - ?) was an American educator, writer, and anthologist. She was the author of Songs of the South. Choice Selections from Southern Poets from Colonial Times to the Present Day. Joel Chandler Harris, who furnished an introduction to the book, said that, as far as he knew, this volume was the first of American anthologies devoted wholly to verse produced by southern writers. Early years and education Jennie Thornley Clarke was born circa 1866 on the banks of James River, Virginia. But she said she was a native  Georgia although she was born among the F. F. Vs (first families of Vermont). Her father was a poet, but he died in early manhood. Brought up in a library and carefully taught by her mother, she was twice graduated with the highest honors; first, by a female college in Georgia and afterwards (in 1889), by the University of Nashville.

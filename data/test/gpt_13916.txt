Elizabeth Hemings ( 1735 – 1807) was the half-sister of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America.  Elizabeth Hemings was born in 1735 to Peter Hemings and his wife Jane Randolph. She was the half-sister of Jefferson Davis, who would later become the president of the Confederate States of America. Hemings' mother died when Elizabeth was very young, leaving her and her brother James in the care of their father.  In 1773, Peter Hemings sued his former slave James Hemings for £1,000 (roughly $160,000 today), claiming that he had been illegally imprisoned and tortured by James Hemings. The case went to trial in 1775, and although James Hemings was acquitted, Peter Hemings' claim led to a public debate over slavery and its legality in England. The trial also led to the exposure of Elizabeth Hemings as Jefferson's half-sister.  Elizabeth Hemings lived out the rest of her life in Monticello, Jefferson's home in Virginia. She died there in 1807 at the age of 80.

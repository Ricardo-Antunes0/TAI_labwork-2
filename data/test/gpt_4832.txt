The Rising Card is a popular category of poker games that was invented by English player John Haigh in the early 1970s. The game is played with a standard 52-card deck and is similar to Texas Hold'em, but with a few key differences.  The Rising Card game is usually played for high stakes, and has been compared to Omaha because of its high variance. One of the biggest advantages of playing the game is that there are few hands that are played over and over again, which makes it an ideal game for high-stakes play.

The Kajika frog or Buerger's frog (Buergeria buergeri) is a species of frog in the family Rhacophoridae. It is endemic to Japan where it can be found on Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku islands. It is locally threatened by habitat loss caused by dam building and construction of concrete riverbanks. Description As with other species in the family Rhacophoridae, the female is bigger than the male. Males are 3.5–4.4 cm and females are 4.9–8.5 cm. Their bodies are flat which allows them to easily hide between rocks. They are grayish-brown in color with speckles which makes for protective camouflage on rocks. There is a dark T-shaped pattern between their eyes. They are able to change their shade of color to a certain extent based on their surroundings. There isn't much individual variance in color. Suction pads grow on the tips of their fingers and toes. Their eggs are dark brown with a diameter of 0.2 cm. Their mouths are big and have suction pads that allow them to cling onto rocks in a strong current in order to not get carried away.

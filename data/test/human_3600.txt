Roy Edmund Steckel (October 17, 1887 â€“ November 14, 1950) was the Los Angeles Police Department Chief of Police from December 30, 1929, to August 9, 1933. He succeeded and was succeeded as chief by James E. "Two-Guns" Davis. During Steckel's reign as Chief of Police, Los Angeles hosted the 1932 Summer Olympic Games. The L.A.P.D. employed 800 duly sworn police officers. According to the L.A.P.D.'s official site, crime was very low during the Olympics, with there being only "two robberies, eight burglaries, 39 thefts, and 10 auto thefts".  Steckel was dismissed as chief by the incoming mayor Frank L. Shaw, who had run on a platform that included calling for Steckel's dismissal. Under Steckel's regime, Mayor John Clinton Porter appointed a former detective with the L.A.P.D. to head up an intelligence operation aimed at both the police department itself and city officials. L.A.P.D. intelligence operatives were bolstered with private investigators, who were given captain's badges. The L.A. City Council disbanded the intelligence operation after three years. The incident led Time Magazine to term the L.A.P.D. "super-snoopers".

This is the discography of Apple Records, a record label formed by the Beatles in 1968. During its early years, the label enjoyed a fair degree of commercial success, most notably with Mary Hopkin and Badfinger, as well as discovering acts such as James Taylor and Billy Preston who would go on to greater success with other labels. However, by the mid-1970s, Apple had become little more than an outlet for the Beatles' solo recordings (although, as the solo Beatles were actually still under contract to EMI, the Apple label was, in truth, only a cosmetic addition to their releases). After EMI's contract with the Beatles ended in 1976, the Apple label was finally wound up. The label was reactivated in the 1990s with many of the original Apple albums being reissued on compact disc, and the company now oversees new Beatles releases such as the Anthology and 1 albums as well as the 2009 Beatles remastering programme. In 2010, Apple set about remastering and reissuing its back catalogue for a second time. For convenience, releases are divided into UK and US releases. However, some releases which were designated a UK-sequence catalogue number were only issued in certain mainland European countries. Additionally, with the Beatles still being under contract to EMI, all of the group's records (and the majority of their UK solo releases) retained the numbering systems of Parlophone (for the UK, New Zealand and South Africa), Capitol (for the US) and EMI (for Australia). The Republic of Ireland released eight Apple singles in 1970â€“71, six of which had unique catalogue numbers. Since the 2013 takeover of EMI by Universal Music, the titles have yet to be reissued with Universal catalogue numbers and UPCs.

Giliana Berneri or Giliane Berneri (5 October 1881 in Livorno, Tuscany – 21 May 1968) was an Italian actress, singer and cabaret performer.  Giliana Berneri was the daughter of the actors Luigi Berneri and Rosa Negri. She made her stage debut at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires in 1904, and quickly became a successful star of Italian and Spanish-language theatre. In 1911 she made her debut on Broadway in New York City, playing the title role in Aida. She toured extensively throughout the United States during the 1920s and 1930s, appearing in such leading roles as Rosalinde in As You Like It, Gilda in Rigoletto, Zerlina in Don Giovanni, and Donna Anna in Don Giovanni.  Berneri's film career began with a small role in the 1923 drama La donna è mobile (The Woman is Mobile). She became one of Italy's most popular actresses during the 1930s, appearing in a range of films including Il diavolo a letto (The Devil on the Bed), Il commissario Montalbano (The Commissioner Montalbano), and L'ultimo bacio (The Last Kiss). In later years she concentrated on cabaret performances, making her final appearance at La Scala Theatre in Milan in 1968.

Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer (18 February 1881 – 3 May 1944) was a Hungarian physicist who made significant contributions to the development of quantum mechanics.  Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer was born in Budapest, Hungary on 18 February 1881. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Budapest in 1904, and his doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1909. He became a professor at the University of Budapest in 1923, and he served as its rector from 1939 to 1944. He died in Budapest on 3 May 1944.  Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer made significant contributions to the development of quantum mechanics. His work on the wave-particle duality of particles led him to develop the theory of wave–particle duality, which is one of the most important foundations of quantum mechanics. He also developed the theory of relativity into a unified theory of gravitation and electromagnetism.

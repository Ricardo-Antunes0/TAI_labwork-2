Gilbert of Assailly (died 1183) was the fifth Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, serving from 1162 or 1163 to 1170, when he was deposed. As Grand Master, he succeeded Auger de Balben (rather than Arnaud de Comps that some compilations listed). Nevertheless, most sources list him as the fifth, rather than fourth, Grand Master and this biography continues that tradition, with the exception being Delaville Le Roulx' work. He was succeeded by Gastone de Murols. Gilbert encouraged Amalric of Jerusalem in his unsuccessful invasion of Egypt, leaving the Order in debt and causing the reexamination of its military role. Biography Little was known of Gilbert before his elevation to the magistracy of the Hospitallers' Order other than he was already old when it was conferred on him, and that the termination of his name suggests that he was of French origin and considered to be a knight. It is with him that the Order became truly military, which is indicated in a letter addressed to Bertrandus, Archbishop of Trani.

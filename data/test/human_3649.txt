Iota Octantis, Latinized, from Î¹ Octantis is a double star in the southern circumpolar constellation Octans. The "A" component has an apparent magnitude of 5.83, making it faintly visible to the naked eye under ideal conditions, but the "B" component can't be seen due to its faintness. The system is located at a distance of 350 light years based on its annual parallax shift, but is drifting away at a rate of . Iota Octantis A has a classification of K0 III, which indicates that it is an evolved K-type star that exhausted hydrogen at its core and left the main sequence. It has an angular diameter of , which yields a radius 12.43 times that of the Sun at its estimated distance. At present Iota Octantis A has 2.49 times the mass of the Sun and radiates at 81 times the luminosity of the Sun from its enlarged photosphere at an effective temperature of , which gives it an orangish-yellow hue. Iota Octantis is metal deficient and spins slowly with a projected rotational velocity of .

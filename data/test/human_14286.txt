The Robert Smalls House is a historic house at 511 Prince Street in Beaufort, South Carolina.  Built in 1843 and altered several times, the house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1974 for its association with Robert Smalls (1839-1915).  Smalls, born into slavery, achieved notice for commandeering the CSS Planter and sailing her to freedom during the American Civil War.  After the war he represented South Carolina in the United States House of Representatives during Reconstruction. Description and history The Robert Smalls House is located in central Beaufort, at the northeast corner of Prince and New Streets.  It is a two-story wood-frame structure, with a side gable roof and a two-story porch extending across its (south-facing) front facade.  A two-story ell extends to the rear, giving the house a basic T shape.  The house was built in 1843, originally with a single-story porch and ell, which were expanded to two stories in 1850 and 1870.

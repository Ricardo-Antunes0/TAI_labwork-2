SongCast is an American digital music distribution service based in Akron, Ohio, United States. It is a website artists use to upload music to iTunes, Apple Music, Spotify, Beats Music, Google Play and Amazon MP3. They've also been known to claim copyrights on music made by CaptainSparkles without his knowledge, including his original music videos on his own YouTube channel. History According to Mashable, SongCast was founded in 2006 and has rights agreements with digital music services.  In 2012, The Huffington Post reported that Caine White, an artist using SongCast's services, was involved in a fraud scheme costing iTunes and Amazon up to $1 million. White uploaded his music to SongCast and other music distribution companies only to buy his own music with stolen credit cards and earning money from the royalties. White did not act alone, eleven other individuals participated by using multiple laptops and software to hide the location the music was being bought from. These individuals were prosecuted and convicted.

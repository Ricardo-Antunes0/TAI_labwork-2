Intervention is an American series that premiered on March 6, 2005, on A&E. It follows one or two participants, who are dependent on or addicted to drugs and/or alcohol. They are documented in anticipation of an intervention meeting by family or friends. During the intervention meeting, loved ones give the addict an ultimatum: go to an inpatient drug rehabilitation program immediately, or else risk losing contact, income, or other privileges. The show follows up on the recovery progress for future episodes or for web shorts. On May 24, 2013, A&E announced it had concluded the series, with remaining episodes to begin airing in June 2013. The final episode in the lineup aired on July 18, 2013, and concluded with reflections from past addicts and thanks from the producers to the interventionists, family members, treatment centers, and addicts. On August 5, 2014, however, LMN announced the revival of the series with a new season premiering in 2015.

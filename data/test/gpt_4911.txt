Moorish Delta 7 (also known as MD7) is a large contiguous area of land in southwestern Louisiana, United States. The name is derived from the Moorish settlers who settled the area in the early 19th century. The area is a significant producer of sugarcane and cotton.  The Moorish settlers who settled the area in the early 19th century were drawn to the fertile soil and abundant rainfall. The region was also strategically located on the Mississippi River, making it an important transportation hub. The first sugar mills were built in the MD7 in 1831, and by 1850, the area had become one of the leading sugar producers in America.  The MD7 was also home to a number of textile mills. By 1940, the region had become one of the leading cotton producers in America. However, with the advent of synthetic fabrics and other production methods, the textile industry began to decline in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Today, the MD7 is a major producer of sugarcane and cotton.

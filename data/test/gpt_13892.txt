The Great Northern Railway (Ireland) JT class diesel locomotives were a class of diesel-electric locomotives built for the Great Northern Railway of Ireland by AEG in the early 1970s.  The JT class were designed as 2-6-0 engines with a tilting cab, and were intended for use on the railway's heavier freight work. They were well-suited to this work, and proved to be very reliable locomotives. In the 1990s, several of the JT class were transferred to other railway operators in Ireland, Italy, and Portugal. As of 2013, all but one of the JT class have been retired from service.

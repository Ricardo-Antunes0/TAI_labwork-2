The RIBA Journal, (often known simply as The Journal), is a quarterly peer-reviewed architectural journal published by the Royal Institute of British Architects. The Journal covers all aspects of architecture, from design and theory to practice and conservation.  The RIBA Journal was established in 1876 as The Architects' Journal. It became The Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1922, and The RIBA Journal in 1954.

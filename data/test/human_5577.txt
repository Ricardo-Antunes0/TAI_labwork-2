"C'est l'amour" is a popular song recorded by Belgian band Léopold Nord & Vous. It was trio's debut single, released in September 1987, from the album of the same name, and perhaps remains to date its most known song, due to the huge success it met in France and the number of cover versions and remixes that it was the subject throughout the years. It can be deemed as band's signature song. Background and release In 1987, Alec Mension, a Belgian artist who had already released several singles in his country, recorded in Tony Visconti studio, in London, a song he wrote in English-language, entitled "Don't walk away". However, no recording company agreed to sign a contract with him, because nobody thought that the song had potential. Mension decided to re-record the song adding French voices to the English mix. He then re-wrote the lyrics in French-language along with his two brothers, Benoît and Hubert, and the song was re-entitled "C'est l'amour". The music video accompagning the song shows two of the singers in an elevator, dressed as baggage handlers and performing the song; the elevator goes up and down and welcomes various people, that what gives rise to various situations.

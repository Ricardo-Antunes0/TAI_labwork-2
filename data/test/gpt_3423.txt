Constantine of Murom (Russian: Святой Блаженный Князь Константин Муромский) was a Russian Orthodox saint and prelate who served as the first bishop of Murom and one of the most successful promoters of Orthodox Christianity in Muscovy.  Born in the principality of Murom in 1092, Constantine was ordained to the priesthood in 1113 and became a bishop in 1118. He played an important role in the conversion of the Khanate of Kazan to Orthodoxy, and he also helped to establish numerous monasteries in Muscovy. He died in 1157 and was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1650.

The D.E.Y. is a Latin hip hop group that formed in 2007. The group is composed of members Divine, Ã‰lan, and Yeyo.  The trio's name is also meant to symbolize a new day in music. Early years Though the trio of musicians who make up the D.E.Y. didn't grow up together, their interests, both personal and musical, were very similar.  When they did eventually meet, they knew immediately that they should work together. MC Divine was born and spent much of his life in the South Bronx, but moved to Puerto Rico in 1998. In 1999, he was introduced to an intrigued Yeyo and the two made a quick connection, recording a single on the night of their meeting that made local radio. Yeyo, born in Puerto Rico, made splashes in the island's underground hip-hip scene in 1999 when he released the politically charged "Viequez." However, like some groups, The D.E.Y. weren't able to make it big until their final addition.

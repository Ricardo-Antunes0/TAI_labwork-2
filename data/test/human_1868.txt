William Fitzner (Schoenlanke, Posen, Kingdom of Prussia, 184517 August 1914, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA), was a German-American architect who practiced in New Orleans, Louisiana, between the 1850s and his death. He was one of the most prolific designers in the city during the late nineteenth century and a major contributor to the city's expansion in the decades after the American Civil War. Career  Fitzner was born in Prussia in 1845 in the Grand Duchy of Posen, an area east of Berlin that is now part of Poland. He immigrated to New Orleans in 1859 at the age of 14 when his sister Emilie married Charles Hillger (18301879), also a German-born architect who would make a solid reputation in New Orleans before his early death. Hillger lived in the Little Saxony district and had formed a partnership with William Drews (1825?) and his brother Gustave, a grocer-carpenter. The three lived there in the same house with their families until Hillger's marriage to Fitzner's sister just before the Civil War.

The Pakistan Press Foundation (PPF) was established in 1967 as a non-profit organisation by the news agency Pakistan Press International and operated until 1974, when it had to suspend operations due to the political environment then prevailing in the country. It was reactivated in 1992 and has since been involved in assisting in the development of independent media in Pakistan by conducting training programmes for journalists, carrying out projects in research and documentation, and campaigning to defend and promote freedom of the press. Training programs PPF regularly organizes training programs and seminars on issues facing the Pakistani media. The organization has worked for the improvement of professional skills, and in helping to raise journalistsâ€™ awareness of professional, social, political and human-rights issues. In December 2016, a survey in Pakistan was conducted by Pakistan Press Foundation that had found that the Pakistani news media allots 30pc of its news coverage to political news and only 1.5pc to human rights issues. This survey was done to bring attention to human rights issues by the government so it could address human rights violations.

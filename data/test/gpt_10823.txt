Henley-on-Thames  is a town and civil parish in the South Oxfordshire district of Oxfordshire, England. The town is located 11 miles southwest of Oxford and 5 miles west of Reading.  Henley-on-Thames was historically an agricultural market town, but in recent years has become a popular tourist destination. The town is noted for its river Thames which flows through it and for its many pubs, restaurants and other tourist attractions. It is twinned with Lausanne, Switzerland.  The town's name is derived from the Old English "Hænlei", meaning "home of the hens", and "Hænlei's well", a water source that is still present today. The name appears as Henna in the Domesday Book of 1086.  The earliest evidence of human habitation in Henley-on-Thames is a Mesolithic flint tool found at Spring Brook. There are signs that Bronze Age people lived in the area around 1000 BC, with evidence of a round barrow near the town centre. In Roman times Henley-on-Thames was part of the Forest of Dean and there are remains of an 8th century fort on Castle Hill. A church was built in 925 AD on land given by Earl Leofwine and the settlement grew slowly due to the lack of good transport links until the opening of the Grand Union Canal in 1825 which made it easier for people to get to.

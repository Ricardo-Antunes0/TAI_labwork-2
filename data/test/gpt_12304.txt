Vitaphone was a sound film system used by the United States from 1927 to 1941. It was the first successful commercial sound system, and its use helped to popularize the use of sound in motion pictures.  The Vitaphone system used a series of discs with sound recordings on both sides, which could be played in a player like a regular movie disc. The discs could be recorded and played back at any speed, and they could be rewound and played multiple times.  The Vitaphone system was initially developed by Western Electric Company as a way to make movies for theater audiences. However, it was eventually adopted by the film industry as a standard way to make movies. Vitaphone discs became popular for use in feature films, shorts, and advertising campaigns.

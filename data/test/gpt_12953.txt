Emily Sarah, Lady Tennyson ( Sellwood; 9 November 1809 – 1882), was a British poet, one of the most popular of her era. She is best known for her long and influential poem, The Waste Land, and other poems including Maud, Idylls of the King, In Memoriam A.E. Housman, and The Lotus Eaters.  Emily Sarah, Lady Tennyson was born in 1809 in the rural town of Sellwood, near Christchurch in Dorset, one of ten children of the Rev. George Tennyson, a Unitarian minister and Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. Emily was a precocious child and began writing poetry at an early age. In 1830, she married Alfred Tennyson, a poet and member of Parliament who later became Poet Laureate.  The couple had four children: Arthur (1831–1892), Marina (1833–1908), Locksley (1835–1911), and Clare (1839–1927). Emily's husband died in 1892, leaving her widowed with four children to raise. She retired to the Isle of Wight in 1894 but continued to write until her death in 1882.

"Where or When" is a show tune from the 1943 musical film Gentleman's Agreement. It was written by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler. The song is a waltz, with lyrics about two people who are unable to meet each other because one is in the past and the other is in the future.  The song was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song but lost to "Over the Rainbow" from The Wizard of Oz.

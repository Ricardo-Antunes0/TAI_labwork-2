The mandibular first premolar is the tooth located laterally (away from the midline of the face) from both the mandibular canines of the mouth but mesial (toward the midline of the face) from both mandibular second premolars.  The function of this premolar is similar to that of canines in regard to tearing being the principal action during mastication, commonly known as chewing.  Mandibular first premolars have two cusps.  The one large and sharp is located on the buccal side (closest to the cheek) of the tooth.  Since the lingual cusp (located nearer the tongue) is small and nonfunctional (which refers to a cusp not active in chewing), the mandibular first premolar resembles a small canine.  There are no deciduous (baby) mandibular premolars.  Instead, the teeth that precede the permanent mandibular premolars are the deciduous mandibular molars. Sometimes, premolars are referred to as bicuspids.  Even though the terms are synonymous, "bicuspid" refers to having two functional cusps, and the mandibular first premolar is an example of a premolar with only one functional cusp.  Thus, "bicuspid" is technically not as accurate as "premolar".

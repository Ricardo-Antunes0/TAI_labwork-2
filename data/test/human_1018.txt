Tilting bolt action is a type of locking mechanism often used in self-loading firearms. Essentially, the design consists of a moving bolt driven by a piston with gas pressure from the gas port behind the muzzle.  The bolt drops down into receiver recess and locks on bolt closing.  Tilting the bolt up and down locks-unlocks in the breech. This tilting allows gas pressure in the barrel from firing the gun to lower to safe levels before the cartridge case is ejected.  It can also be adapted for repeating rifles. For handgun design, the tilting barrel as used in the Browning, is a similar operating mechanism. The tilting bolt has lost favor in contemporary firearm design of rifle caliber to locking systems such as the rotating bolt due to reasons such as increased wearing of the surfaces acted on, higher demands on the receiver due to transfer of locking stresses to it (e. g., it can't be made from aluminium or stamped sheet steel) & better potential accuracy of rotating bolt. Yet it is widespread in vintage firearms listed below.

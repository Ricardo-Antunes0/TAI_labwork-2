The Liberation Government was formed on 23 September 1944, following the liberation of Luxembourg by British and Canadian troops. The government was led by Jean Monnet, a French politician who had fled to Luxembourg after being arrested in 1942 for his participation in the French Resistance. The government's first task was to organize the reconstruction of the country following five years of occupation by Nazi Germany.  The Liberation Government was disbanded on 10 October 1951, after it had failed to win a referendum on a new constitution. The constitution would have created a unicameral parliamentary system and granted more power to the regions.

President's House is a historic house at 17 Quincy Street, on the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  It served as a residence for Harvard Presidents until 1971, when Derek Bok (1971-1991) moved his family to Elmwood. In 1995, the building was renamed, and is currently known as Loeb House. History President's House was donated to Harvard University by then president A. Lawrence Lowell. It was designed by Lowell's cousin, Guy Lowell and completed in 1912. During World War II, President James Bryant Conant and his family allowed the United States Navy to use the building for its V-12 Navy College Training Program. In 1971, Harvard President Derek Bok chose to live at Elmwood, off Brattle Street, which had previously housed deans of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. In 1995, the building was renamed to honor steady benefactors, John Langeloth Loeb Sr. and Frances Lehman Loeb by President Neil Rudenstine. There are historic records that indicate that the University had wanted to name the building after its actual donor but had been opposed by A. Lawrence Lowell himself. When the building was renamed a number of students and alumni successfully complained about the lack of contemporary acknowledgment there and a painting and plaque were added honoring the actual donor.

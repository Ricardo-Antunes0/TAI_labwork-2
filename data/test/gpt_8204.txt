Underground hip hop is an umbrella term used to describe hip hop music that is not generally accepted by mainstream audiences. It typically contains more explicit lyrics, darker beats, and basslines than mainstream hip hop, and often relies on sampling or remixing older underground hip hop tracks to create new material.  Underground hip hop began in the early 1980s as a way for rappers to get their music heard outside of the traditional hip hop music industry. While some mainstream hip hop artists have incorporated elements of underground hip hop into their work, it has generally been viewed as a separate genre.  Some of the most well-known underground hip hop artists include MF DOOM, Kanye West, and Prince Paul. While underground hip hop is often associated with gangsta rap, the genre has also been used for more soulful and introspective styles.

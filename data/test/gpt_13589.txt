The Great Galeoto (Spanish: El gran Galeoto) is a storm that struck the Iberian Peninsula in December 2013. At its peak, the storm had wind speeds of up to 329 km/h (204 mph). The resulting winds and rain caused extensive damage to coastal areas, particularly in Portugal, Spain and Andalusia. In total, at least 16 people died as a result of the storm, and millions were left without power.

The Tupolev Tu-1 was a prototype Soviet bomber aircraft of the World War II era. It was designed by Tupolev and first flew in March 1938. The Tu-1 was the first Soviet bomber to have an all-metal construction, making it much more durable than its predecessors. It was also one of the first bombers to be armed with a nuclear bomb, which it carried on its second prototype, the Tu-2. The Tu-1 proved to be a formidable aircraft and saw service with the Soviet Union and its allies during World War II. After the war, it was replaced by the more advanced Tu-4 and Tu-6 bombers.

George VI Sound or Canal Jorge VI was a 125 kilometer long waterway in Chile that connected the Pacific Ocean with the Atacama desert. The canal was named after King George VI of the United Kingdom.  Construction of the canal began in 1938 and it was completed in 1942. At its widest point, the canal was 13 meters deep and had a maximum depth of 202 meters. The canal was used to transport goods and minerals between the Pacific Ocean and the Atacama desert.  The canal was abandoned in 1973 due to economic problems. In 2006, efforts were made to revive the canal as a tourist destination. However, these efforts have not been successful.

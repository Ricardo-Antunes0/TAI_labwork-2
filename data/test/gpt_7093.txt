In nutrition, biology, and chemistry, fat usually refers to a substance that is a source of energy, either as a distinct type of molecule (e.g. triglycerides) or as a component of a macronutrient. It is also used as a synonym for body mass index (BMI), which is a measurement of weight in relation to height.

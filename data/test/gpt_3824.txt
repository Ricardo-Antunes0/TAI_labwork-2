The City Observatory was an astronomical observatory located in the city of San Francisco, California.  Opened in 1853, City Observatory was the first public observatory in California and one of the oldest in the United States. It was also one of the largest, with a telescope that could see objects as far away as Mars.   The observatory remained open until 1983, when it was closed due to budget cuts. It was later restored and reopened as an outreach center for the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1991. The City Observatory is now operated by the San Francisco Foundation.

Jeremy Adam Duvendeck (born October 28, 1981, in Santa Barbara, California) is a retired American professional track cyclist. He represented the United States in two editions of the Olympic Games (2004 and 2008), and later claimed two elite national titles each in men's sprint (2003) and Keirin (2006) at the U.S. Track Cycling Championships. Before retiring to focus on his coaching career in 2009, Duvendeck rode for the Momentum Cycling Team. Racing career As a multi-sport athlete during his early years in Santa Barbara, California, Duvendeck had been competing numerous times in baseball, soccer, tennis, and volleyball until he began his cycling career as a cross-country mountain biker at the age of thirteen. After spending a year in off-road racing, Duvendeck purchased his first road bike, and instead made a decision to focus instead on track cycling under the guidance of his personal coach and 1984 Olympian Rory O'Reilly. Four years later, Duvendeck sought sporting headlines on the domestic cycling scene with a surprising triumph in the men's kilometre time trial at the 1999 USA Cycling Junior Track Championships. Following his early success, Duvendeck continued to display his versatility as a solid, all-around track cyclist by adding the U.S. men's team sprint title to his career hardware in 2003.

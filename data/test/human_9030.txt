The Jordan River Parkway is an approximately  urban park that runs along the Jordan River within the U.S. state of Utah.  The parkway follows along the river from Utah Lake in Utah County, through Salt Lake County and onto the Great Salt Lake in Davis County. The majority of a mixed-use trail has been completed with a shared-use path for cyclists, skaters, and joggers. A separate equestrian path runs on the southern portion of the trail. Many trail-heads, city and county parks and golf courses are also located along the parkway. History The parkway was conceived in 1971 primarily as a flood-control measure, but restoration of the floodplain, cleanup of pollution, adding trails and other recreational opportunities were also to be included.  Requests for a river master plan included two reservoirs, the Lampton in South Jordan and the Riverton in Riverton and Draper, but plans for the reservoirs were dropped by the State Legislature in 1980. The Utah Legislature approved a bill in 1973 that created the Provo-Jordan River Parkway Authority. The Parkway Authority received $3 million in funds and was charged with constructing the parkway. The Parkway Authority moved slowly through the 1970s, primarily buying land and cleaning up the water, plus other cities were also buying land on the river.

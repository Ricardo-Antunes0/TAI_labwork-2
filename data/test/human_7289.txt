Ailing Dojčin ( or , Bulgarian: Болен Дойчин, Bolen Doychin, Macedonian: Болен Дојчин, Bolen Dojčin) is a hero of South Slavic epic poetry, atypical for being depicted as an ill person. Narrative The poems about Ailing Dojčin, though differing in details, follow the same basic line of narrative. Black Arab comes to the city of Salonica and imposes a daily tax upon its citizens, which includes a young woman for his entertainment. When the turn comes for Dojčin's household to pay the tax, his sister is to be given to the Arab. Dojčin rises from his sickbed after nine years of lying, and confronts the Arab. After killing him, he returns to his bed and dies in peace. In some variants of the narrative, Dojčin has a wife, who attends him together with his sister. In most variants, there is another villain beside Black Arab—Dojčin's own blood brother, a blacksmith. Before the duel, Dojčin's sister or wife asks the blacksmith to shoe his horse on the promise to pay later for the service. The blacksmith, however, asks her to sleep with him, which she refuses with indignation and tells Dojčin about the incident. Dojčin, having killed the Arab, visits the blacksmith and cuts his head off.

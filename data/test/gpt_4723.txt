St. Lawrence Market is a major public market in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Located in the city's downtown core, it is the largest wholesale food market in North America and one of the largest in the world.  The market was founded in 1806 by John Rolph, who rented a space on Front Street near King Street West. The site was originally occupied by a number of small shops and stalls. It grew rapidly, and by 1848 had moved to its present location at Front and Parliament Streets. The market is now a popular tourist destination, with over 100 traditional food vendors selling everything from fruits and vegetables to meat and seafood.  The market is also home to a number of small retailers, art galleries, and music venues. In addition to its traditional role as a wholesale food market, it is also used for concerts, fairs, and other events.

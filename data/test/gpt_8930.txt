In biology and ecology, abiotic components or abiotic factors are environmental conditions that do not involve life. Abiotic components can be elements, substances, or processes.  Abiotic factors can play an important role in the biotic and abiotic interactions that occur in ecosystems. For example, abiotic factors such as temperature, rainfall, and sunlight can affect the growth of plants and the survival of animals. Abiotic factors can also affect the composition of soil and water, the distribution of species, and the stability of ecosystems.

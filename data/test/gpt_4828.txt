A bill of lading  (sometimes abbreviated B/L) is an agreement between two or more parties, typically a shipper and a carrier, specifying the terms and conditions under which goods are transported. It is a document of title to goods, indicating that the carrier is responsible for delivering the goods to the shipper's specified destination.

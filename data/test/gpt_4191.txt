Giles v. California, 554 U.S. 353 (2008), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the First Amendment protects a private person's right to burn a copy of the Quran.  The case began when Muslims in California filed a lawsuit against Christian pastor Terry Giles, alleging that he had violated their right to free exercise of religion by burning a copy of the Quran. The United States District Court for the Central District of California ruled in favor of Giles, finding that burning the Quran did not amount to "viewing, speaking, or writing about religion" and was therefore protected by the First Amendment. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision, finding that burning the Quran constituted "viewing, speaking, or writing about religion" and therefore violated the Muslims' rights under the Constitution.  The United States Supreme Court ultimately decided in favor of Giles, holding that burning a copy of the Quran does not constitute speech about religion and is therefore protected by the First Amendment. The court also found that the 9th Circuit's interpretation of the Constitution was too broad and would allow other forms of religious expression to be prohibited.

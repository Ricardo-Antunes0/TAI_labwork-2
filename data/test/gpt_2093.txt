The Danville Meetinghouse (also known as The Old Meetinghouse) is a historic meetinghouse located in Danville, Massachusetts. The meetinghouse was built in 1768 and is a well-preserved example of early New England Meetinghouse architecture. It is also one of the few surviving meetinghouses from the early days of the American Revolution, and has been designated a National Historic Landmark.  The Danville Meetinghouse is located on Main Street in the center of Danville, just south of its junction with State Street. It is a modest single-story wood frame structure, with a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance sheltered by a gabled hood supported by four slender columns. The interior features a modest central chamber with wooden pews on both sides, and a gallery on the first floor. The meetinghouse was extensively restored in the 1970s, and now serves as the town hall for Danville.

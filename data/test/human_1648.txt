It is one of the three Angelicum Schools established by Fr. Rogelio B. Alarcon, O.P. in the 1970s that pioneered in a non-graded, open-classroom education system in the Philippines. The school is also known for the Lizares Mansion, former heritage house turned school building which stands in the school's campus. It is one of Iloilo's imposing landmarks. The school grounds and the mansion lights up during the Christmas season with a grand opening called "Daigon Slash Sigaboom." History of Angelicum and the Lizares Mansion The concept of a school catering to the individual needs of each learner was on the mind of Fr. Rogelio B. Alarcon, O.P. when he was a student of Colegio de San Juan de Letran in Manila. In 1972, he (then the first Prior Provincial of the Dominican Province of the Philippines) was able to convince some educators and the Provincial Council to establish a non-graded school. It was to be called Angelicum after one of the Dominican houses of studies in Rome and in honor of the Dominican Angelic Doctor of the Church St. Thomas Aquinas, the Universal Patron Saint of Catholic schools.

Thirumeninathar temple (also called Boominathar temple or Tiruchuli temple) is a Hindu temple dedicated to the deity Shiva, located in  Tiruchuli in Virudhunagar district, in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Shiva is worshipped as Thirumeninathar, and is represented by the lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Thunaimalaiyammai Amman. The temple is located on the Virudhunagar–Manamadurai road. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanmars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The temple is closely associated with Sundarar, who has sung praises about the presiding deity. This shrine is regarded as the 12th of the Tevara Stalams in the Pandya region of Tamil Nadu. The temple complex covers an area of two and half acres and all its shrines are enclosed with concentric rectangular walls. The temple has a number of shrines, with those of Thirumeninathar, his consort Thunaimalai Amman and Pralayavitankar being the most prominent. The temple has three daily rituals at various times from 6:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and many yearly festivals on its calendar. The Thirukalyana festival during the Tamil month of Panguni (February–March) and Chitra Pournamai are the most prominent festivals celebrated in the temple.

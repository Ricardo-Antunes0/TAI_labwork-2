Maryland Route 381 (MD 381) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known as Brandywine Road, the highway runs  from MD 231 at Patuxent north to U.S. Route 301 (US 301) in Brandywine. MD 381 connects Brandywine with the southeastern corner of Prince George's County and the northeastern corner of Charles County. The highway was constructed from MD 5 through Brandywine in the 1910s. MD 381 was extended southeast to MD 231 in the late 1920s and early 1930s. When MD 5 was relocated between Camp Springs and Brandywine in the mid-1950s, MD 381 was extended north along the old road to Camp Springs. The highway was rolled back to its present terminus at US 301 in the mid-1960s. The route can serve as an alternate route to the more heavily traveled MD 5 for those wanting to go from St. Mary's, Calvert, and eastern Charles counties to Brandywine. Route description

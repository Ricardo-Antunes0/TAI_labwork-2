Stir the Blood is the third studio album by New York-based rock band The Bravery. The album was released on December 1, 2009, and features the singles "Slow Poison" and "I Am Your Skin". Production To record the album, the band had to leave New York behind and head upstate and into the woods. The group set up shop for Stir the Blood at Dreamland Recording: a recording facility in an old 1800s church which, years ago, housed the Pixies for an unnamed project and The B-52's as they recorded "Love Shack". There, as most of the band came in and out, Endicott stayed in a neighboring house for several months as he helmed the producer's desk for the new record, alongside John Hill (Santigold and Shakira, for example). Songs like "Slow Poison", "She's So Bendable", "I Am Your Skin" and "Hatef--k" came about as Endicott picked through riffs recorded here and there from the band's tour in support of 2007's The Sun and the Moon. Endicott claims "there is a dark tone to this album" and that "there's an angry undertone to it". "I was pretty pissed off when I wrote a lot of the songs", says Endicott. He also claims that while the lyrics, which also focus on "intimacy", may be dark, the music stays upbeat.

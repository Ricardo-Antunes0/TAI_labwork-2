Electronic Music Studios (EMS) is a synthesizer music production studio established in 1978 in Los Angeles by Rick Wakeman and Dave Stewart. The studio has been responsible for many seminal albums in the electronic music genre, including the debut album of Yoko Ono, the debut album of Kraftwerk, and the debut album of David Bowie.  The studio was originally known as The Record Plant and was later renamed Westlake Recording Studios. In 1992, it was acquired byEMS Corporation. The company has since moved to a new location in Hollywood.  Rick Wakeman is considered the father of progressive rock music and he is perhaps best known for his work with Yes. Dave Stewart is a Grammy-nominated producer and musician who has collaborated with artists including Pink Floyd, U2, and The Rolling Stones.

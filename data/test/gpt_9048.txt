The Whores' Petition (also known as The Great Petition of London) was a document written in 1640 by a group of women, many of whom were prostitutes, calling for the decriminalization of prostitution.  The Whores' Petition was written in 1640 by a group of women, many of whom were prostitutes, calling for the decriminalization of prostitution. The petition was addressed to King Charles I and argued that the criminalization of prostitution was unjust and did not protect the women involved. The petition was signed by over 1,500 women, including some of the most famous prostitutes in London at the time, and it is considered to be one of the earliest examples of organized campaigning on behalf of sex workers.  The Whores' Petition has been instrumental in shaping subsequent debates around sex work and reproductive rights. It has been used as evidence in many subsequent legal cases involving sex workers, and its influence can be seen in contemporary movements such as the Sex Workers Alliance UK. The petition remains a valuable source of information and inspiration for campaigners working to protect sex workers' rights.

Stenotrophomonas is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria, comprising at least ten species. The main reservoirs of Stenotrophomonas are soil and plants. Stenotrophomonas species range from common soil organisms (S. nitritireducens) to opportunistic human pathogens (S. maltophilia), the molecular taxonomy of the genus is still somewhat unclear. Importance  The most common species, S. maltophilia is very versatile and can be beneficial for plant growth and health, can be used in agriculture, biocontrol, bioremediation and phytoremediation strategies as well as the production of biomolecules of economic value. On the other hand, some of S. maltophilia strains are pathogenic to humans with multidrug resistant profile. S. indologenes can also cause or be part of polymicrobial infections in humans, especially small children. Stenotrophomonas can also be phytopathogenic unlike closely related genera Xylella and Xanthomonas. Members of the genus Stenotrophomonas have an important ecological role in the nitrogen and sulphur cycles. Stenotrophomonas species, especially S. maltophilia and S. rhizophila, are often found in association with plants, such as cucumber, oilseed rape, potato, strawberry, alfalfa, sunflower, maize, rice, wheat, various weeds, willow and poplar. Stenotrophomonas can be isolated from the rhizosphere or from internal plant tissues, particularly from the vascular tissues of the root and stem.

Fistula Foundation is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization devoted to the prevention and relief of fistula, a chronic, life-threatening condition caused by obstetric fistula.  The Fistula Foundation was founded in 2000 by Jody Brown and Nancy Cook, two women who had experienced obstetric fistula firsthand. Since then, the Fistula Foundation has become one of the world’s leading organizations devoted to the prevention and relief of fistula. The Foundation’s work has benefited more than 10,000 women and children in over 20 countries.  The Fistula Foundation is a national leader in the development and implementation of innovative programs to prevent and treat obstetric fistula. The Foundation’s flagship program, Fistula Prevention Services (FPS), provides expert care and support to women living in high-risk areas who are at risk of developing fistula. FPS also engages in advocacy to improve the health care delivery for women with obstetric fistula worldwide.  In addition to FPS, the Fistula Foundation operates several other programs that benefit women living with obstetric fistula: Fistula Treatment Services (FTS), which provides medical and surgical care to women who have undergone surgery to repair their fistulas; Fistula Rehabilitation Services (FRS), which provides rehabilitation therapy to help women regain their independence; and Fistula Education and Outreach (FEOR), which provides information and support to patients, families, health professionals, and the public about fistula.

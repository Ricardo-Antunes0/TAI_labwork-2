Pipe, Wisconsin is an unincorporated community in the Town of Calumet in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, United States. It is located approximately  east of Lake Winnebago. History On September 25, 1817, United States Army Judge Advocate Samuel A. Storrow traveled from Green Bay, Wisconsin to Chicago. He described a Native American village he saw: "...we saw it at a distance. It was a village of Fals Avoines [rice gatherers], situate on the edge of a prairie which borders Lake Winnebago. The Lake lay before it on one side, and on the other the prairie, rising with a gentle acclivity from the margin of the water. The spot was well chosen for beauty, warmth, and fertility. There was nothing about that indicated a recent commencement. The grounds bore marks of long cultivation, and the few trees were left standing seemed as if distributed for ornament and shade. The village has received the name of Calumet [Pipe]; it consists of about 150 souls, and has rarely been visited by whites, except a few voyageurs on their way to Ouisconsin [Wisconsin]."

Richard Edgar Skeen (March 15, 1906  â€“ June 24, 1990) was an American professional tennis player and teacher. He was runner-up to Fred Perry in the Men's Singles in the 1941 U.S. Pro Tennis Championships, reaching as high as World No. 2 pro that year according to Ray Bowers (and No. 4 in his amateur-pro combined rankings). Skeen reached the semifinals of other tournaments on four occasions that year. Bill Tilden recommended Dick as an outstanding Tennis Teacher in California in his 1950 book, 'How to Play Better Tennis'. Biography Dick Skeen was born in Dallas, Texas in 1906 and died in Medford, Oregon in 1990 at age 84. Tennis player, Dale Jensen, became a student and close friend at the Balboa Bay Club, and encouraged Dick to write a tennis book, entitled Tennis Champions are Made, not Born, published in 1976. Dale used this knowledge to teach Mike Carrico. Dale and Dick remained close friends until Dick died in 1990. Skeen taught three World Champions (Jack Kramer, Louise Brough, and Pauline Betz) and forty National Champions, including Billy Talbert, George Richards, Gussie Moran, Kathleen Harter, Carole Caldwell, Julius Heldman and Jimmy Wade. Skeen was ranked No. 1 in the National Senior 65-and-over in 1972, after a 28-year layoff.

The investment function is a summary of the decision-making process used by an individual, corporation or government when investing in securities. It is a model that predicts how much money an investor will earn given a set of initial conditions and assumptions about future events.  There are four main components to the investment function: the risk-free rate, the expected return on investment, the beta coefficient and the riskiness of the security. The risk-free rate is the rate at which an investor can earn guaranteed returns, such as those offered by government bonds or savings accounts. The expected return on investment is the percentage of return an investor expects to earn on a security over time. The beta coefficient is a measure of how much an asset's price depends on its underlying asset (such as stock prices) compared to the market average. The riskiness of the security is a measure of how much volatility an investment carries, and reflects both the amount of risk and reward associated with holding that security.

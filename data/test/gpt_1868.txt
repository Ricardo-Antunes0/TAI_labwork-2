William Fitzner (Schoenlanke, Posen, Kingdom of Prussia, March 8, 1809 – Vienna, April 3, 1881) was a German physician and anatomist who is best known for his work on the development of the human embryo.  Fitzner was born in Schoenlanke, Province of Posen in Prussia, the son of a Lutheran pastor. He studied medicine at the University of Königsberg, where he was influenced by Georges Cuvier. He later transferred to the University of Berlin, where he obtained his doctorate in 1834.  In 1839, Fitzner became an assistant to Karl Ernst von Baer at the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg. In 1846, he became professor of comparative anatomy and physiology at the University of Vienna. Fitzner's work on embryology is considered ground-breaking; he was one of the first scientists to study the development of the human embryo systematically and objectively. He also made significant contributions to zoology and botany.  Fitzner retired from his professorship in 1872. He died in Vienna two years later at the age of 76.

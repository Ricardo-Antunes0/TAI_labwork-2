In meteorology (and climatology), a mesonet, portmanteau of meson and network, is a weather observation network operated by the National Weather Service that extends beyond the primary weather stations. Mesonet data is used in weather forecasting, climate research and emergency management.  A mesonet typically consists of a network of temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors located at various points throughout a region. The data from these sensors is processed to create a three-dimensional map of the regional climate. Mesonet data can also be used to improve weather forecasts by providing better understanding of how different weather patterns affect different parts of the region.  Mesonet networks are particularly important for studying climate change because they provide long-term data that is not subject to the seasonal changes that can affect weather station readings.

Dr. Georgina "George" Woodson is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera Doctors, portrayed by Stirling Gallacher. She first appeared during the episode broadcast on 7 January 2003, and departed on 27 March 2009. George is introduced alongside husband Ronnie Woodson (Seán Gleeson), and together the pair have a daughter, Bracken (Jessica Gallagher). Development Shortly after joining the cast, Gallacher fell pregnant. The producers decided against writing in her pregnancy, as they felt that George and her husband Ronnie Woodson (Seán Gleeson) were not ready for it. The couple were seen discussing the issue of having children, but the storyline led to the revelation that Ronnie is "frightened" about having a child. Gallacher explained, "When a child of one of the other characters is snatched, Ronnie thinks its too great a responsibility to take on and he cant cope with all the worry." The producer informed Gallacher that they would film around her bump and she expected to be hiding behind filing cabinets and carrying large bags.

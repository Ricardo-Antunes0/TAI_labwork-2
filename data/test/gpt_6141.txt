On the Mountain is Thomas Bernhard’s first play and the first of his long sequence of plays dealing with the Austria of the early twentieth century. It is set in the small town of Dornbach on the outskirts of Vienna, in 1912. The play tells the story of a group of people who are trying to find a way to deal with their collective sense of emptiness and aimlessness.  The play has been widely praised for its unyielding portrayal of Austrian society at the time, as well as its elegant language. It has been compared to fellow Austrian playwright Arthur Schnitzler’s plays for its exploration of the psychology and emotions of its characters.

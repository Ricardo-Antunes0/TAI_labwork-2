David Anton Randall (5 April 1905 â€“ 7 November 1988) was an English mathematician and astronomer.  Randall was born in 1905 in Woking, Surrey, England. He studied mathematics at Cambridge University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1925 and a Master of Arts in 1926. He then studied at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he received his doctorate in 1931.  Randall worked as a lecturer at Cambridge University from 1927 until 1934, when he moved to the University of Chicago as an assistant professor. He became a professor at Chicago in 1944, and remained there until his retirement in 1978.  Randall's work focused on celestial mechanics and gravitation. He is best known for his development of the theory of general relativity, which has been called one of the most significant achievements of twentieth century physics. He also made important contributions to the theory of elasticity and to the theory of vector fields.  Randall was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1944 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950. He was awarded the Hughes Medal in 1967 and the Medal for Scientific Achievement by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics in 1978. He died on 7 November 1988.

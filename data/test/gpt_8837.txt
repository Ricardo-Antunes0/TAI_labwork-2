Daniel Vocatius sometimes Vocensis, Vocacensis or Vocacio, (c.1585â€“1645) was a Flemish composer and violinist who was one of the most important representatives of the Baroque era in the Netherlands.  Born in the city of Ghent, then part of the Habsburg Netherlands, Vocatius began his career as a violinist and composer in the service of Archduke Leopold I, governor of the Spanish Netherlands. He soon established himself as one of the most important figures in Dutch music, and his works are still widely played today.  Vocatius is best known for his choral works, including the motet "Nisi Dominus" and the Te Deum. He was also a prolific composer for solo instruments, including the violoncello, recorder and flute. His compositions display a blend of traditional French and Italian styles with elements of Dutch folk music.

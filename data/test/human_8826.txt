The Ed Eskelin Ranch is a historic residential and agricultural complex in Lake County, Oregon, United States. As a historic resource, the complex captures elements of two different phases of early 20th century settlement in the Fort Rock Basin. It represents the perseverance and resourcefulness required of modest-scale ranchers and farmers in frontier conditions and during economic hardship. Architecturally, the ranch preserves excellent examples of the construction styles and knowledge in use by common homesteaders in the period, as well as elements of the Finnish cultural heritage of the region. History The first influx of settlers began around 1909, driven by the 1909 Enlarged Homestead Act and the 1916 Stock-Raising Homestead Act, as well as Union Pacific Railroad promotion and publicity from the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition of 1905. Prominent among the settler population in this period were Finnish and Norwegian immigrant farmers including Fred Eskelin. However, many settlers were drawn by the unusually wet weather in years before 1909; when precipitation returned to its long-term, semiarid average, the large majority of settlers, including the Eskelin family, were unable to sustain agricultural operations in the dry conditions and abandoned their homesteads.

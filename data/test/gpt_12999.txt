Rudolf Hirzel (20 March 1846, Leipzig - 2 October 1917, Mainz) was a German mathematician who contributed to the theory of differential equations and the calculus of variations. He is also known for his theory on the stability of solutions to certain PDEs.  Rudolf Hirzel was born in Leipzig, Germany on 20 March 1846. He attended the University of Leipzig, where he studied mathematics and physics under Theodor KÃ¤stner and Carl Friedrich Gauss. Hirzel received his doctorate from the University of Leipzig in 1871.  Hirzel spent most of his career at the University of Mainz, where he served as a professor from 1881 until his death in 1917. He is best known for his contributions to differential equations and calculus of variations, but he also made notable contributions to the theory of stability of solutions to certain PDEs. Hirzel was a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society of London. He was awarded the Euler Medal in 1902 and the Copley Medal in 1911.

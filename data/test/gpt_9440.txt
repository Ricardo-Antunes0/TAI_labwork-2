On February 17, 2007, Almrei was arrested by Iranian security forces and charged with belonging to the People's Mujahideen of Iran (PMI), a terrorist organization. He was executed two years later on February 17, 2009, after being convicted of involvement in bombings that killed 14 people and injured more than 50 others.

His death has been recognized by human rights organizations around the world and has prompted calls for his case to be investigated by the International Criminal Court.

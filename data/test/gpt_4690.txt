Auburn Dam was a proposed concrete arch-gravity dam on the Trinity River in Trinity County, Texas, in the United States. The dam would have been 343 feet (103 meters) high and 919 feet (269 meters) wide at its base, with a storage capacity of 54,000 acre feet (590 million cubic meters).  The dam was first proposed in the early 1950s and was approved by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1962. Construction began in 1964, but was abandoned in 1969 due to a lack of funding. The project was revived in the 1980s and completed in 1992 at a cost of $1.5 billion.

Himmelev was located in Sømme Herred  and emerged as a parish some time during the 12th century. The residents were mainly farmers. The parish belonged to Roskilde Abbey. In 1731, the members of the parish obtained the right to elect their own priest. The first school opened in 1741 and was expanded in 1914. In 1906, Himmelev had a population of 600. Roskilde Folk High School opened in Himmelev in 1907. The land was redeveloped with single family detached homes in the 1960s and 1970s.

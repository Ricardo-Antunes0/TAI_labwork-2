Al Bernstein (born 1949 in Austria) is an Austrian-born American visual artist.  Bernstein was born in 1949 in Vienna, Austria, to a Jewish family. He immigrated to the United States in 1969 and began his career as a graphic designer in New York City. Bernstein's early works focused on the exploration of typography and layout, and he is well known for his early collaborations with artists like Kenny Scharf, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and David Salle. His work has since evolved into a more abstract style, characterized by fragmented planes of color and intricate patterns. He has exhibited throughout the United States and Europe, and his work is held in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Art Institute of Chicago. Bernstein has also taught at Columbia University and the Pratt Institute. In 2006, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Bard College.

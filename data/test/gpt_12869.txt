HMS Renown was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched on 14 December 1798 at Harwich. She was wrecked in a storm on 12 November 1809, and broken up in 1810.  Renown was one of a new type of third-rate ship, designed by Sir Edward Pellew, that was intended to be more mobile and versatile than the older types. She was active in the Napoleonic Wars as part of the Channel Fleet, taking part in several major battles, including the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801 and the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. After Trafalgar she took part in the blockade of Cadiz before returning to England in 1809. In November of that year she was wrecked off the coast of Portugal while on a voyage to reinforce Sir John Moore's army in Spain.

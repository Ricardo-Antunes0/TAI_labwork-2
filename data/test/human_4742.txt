Wiremu "Piri" Te Ranga Poutapu  (8 June 1905 – 20 August 1975) was a New Zealand  Māori master carver and carpenter. He identified with the Ngāti Korokī and Waikato iwi. He was born in Maungatautari, Waikato, New Zealand in 1905. He was known as Piri, the Māori transliteration of Bill, short for William, of which his first name Wiremu is the Māori transliteration. Poutapu was a protégé of Te Puea Herangi who sent him to the School of Maori Arts at Ohinemutu in 1929. He spent three years there learning adzeing, carving and traditional lore from Eramiha Neke Kapua. During this time he also worked with brothers Pine and Hone Taiapa, leading Ngāti Porou carvers. In 1932 he returned to Ngāruawāhia where he established a carving school. One of his pupils was Inia Te Wiata. Poutapu was one of the leaders in the building of Turongo, the Māori king's official residence at Turangawaewae Marae, between 1934 and 1938. He was a confidant and secretary to Māori king Korokī and was then a member of the Tekau-ma-rua (council of twelve) for Māori queen Te Atairangikaahu. Some of Poutapu's best known carvings include carvings for Rotorua Boys' High School and Te Aute College, as well as restoring the Te Winika and Ngātokimatawhaorua war canoes.

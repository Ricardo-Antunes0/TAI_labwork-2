Maurice Clifford Williams (26 June 1926 – 9 October 1992) was an English Labour Party politician. He served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bristol West from 1970 to 1987, and then for Bristol South from 1987 to 1992.  Williams was born in Bristol, the son of Clifford Williams, a docker, and his wife Lilian (née Curtis). He was educated at Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and the University of Bristol, where he read law. He became a solicitor in 1951.  Williams first stood for Parliament in Bristol West in 1959, but was unsuccessful. He was elected to Parliament in 1970, and served until his death in 1992. In parliament, he was a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee and the Public Accounts Committee. He also served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Roy Hattersley and Barbara Castle.  Williams was a strong supporter of the Labour Party's national policies, and was a prominent figure on the left wing of the party. He opposed the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, and is known for his outspokenness and willingness to cross party lines. Williams also had a strong interest in social justice issues, particularly on housing and unemployment. He is particularly remembered for his work on behalf of inner city communities in Bristol.  Williams married Doreen Elizabeth Chitty in 1958. They had two children together; one son, Michael Williams, who later became a Labour MP himself, and one daughter, Julie Williams. Williams died from lung cancer at the age of 67 years old.

Musahiplik or Müsahiplik (roughly, "Companionship / Spiritual Friendship") is a Turkish traditional voluntary organization founded in 1958 by a group of intellectuals and businessmen who were dissatisfied with the existing social and religious organizations.  The goals of Müsahiplik are to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas and experiences, to promote friendship and goodwill among its members, and to provide assistance in times of need. Membership is open to anyone who desires it, and meetings are held regularly throughout the country.  Müsahiplik is particularly active in providing assistance to the needy, providing shelter and food to the homeless, and helping victims of natural disasters. The organization has also been involved in promoting interfaith understanding, education, and humanitarianism.

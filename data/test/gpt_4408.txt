John Neely Johnson (August 2, 1825 – March 8, 1886) was an American politician who served as the 27th Governor of Texas (1875–1879). Johnson is best known for his role in the Reconstruction of Texas, during which he helped to secure the rights of African Americans and secure voting rights for them.  Johnson was born in Kentucky to John and Sarah (née Green) Johnson. He attended Transylvania University and then studied law in Lexington. He moved to Texas in 1849 and entered the practice of law in Austin. He became chairman of the Republican Party of Texas in 1859 and served two terms as state treasurer. In 1865, Johnson was elected by the Texas legislature to serve as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention that drafted the new state constitution. He was also a delegate to the State Democratic Convention that year.  In 1870, Johnson was elected governor on a platform that included support for Reconstruction. As governor, he played a leading role in implementing reforms designed to protect the civil rights of African Americans in Texas. He also played a key role in securing voting rights for African Americans, which helped them play a more active role in state politics.  Johnson retired from office in 1879 and returned to his legal practice. He died in 1886 at the age of 68 and was buried at Live Oak Cemetery in Austin.

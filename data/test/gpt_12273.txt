Body flex is a lack of rigidity in the body that allows for more movement and flexibility. This is caused by a decrease in muscle tension and a decrease in the levels of the chemicals norepinephrine and cortisol.  The main benefits of body flex are that it allows for more range of motion and increased flexibility. This can lead to better overall health and a decreased risk of injury. It can also improve athletic performance and help with weight loss.

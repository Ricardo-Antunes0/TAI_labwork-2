The Oaks Airfield is an unlicensed private airfield located in the town of Oaks, in the county of Essex, England. The airfield is situated close to the village of South Benfleet and is used for flying model aircraft.  The airfield was opened in 2007 by two model aircraft enthusiasts, and has since grown to become one of the busiest privately owned airfields in the UK. The airfield has a grass runway that is long and wide. It also has a number of abandoned buildings that can be used for storage or as crash pads.

In mathematics, the notion of the continuity of a function is a fundamental notion that allows one to calculate certain properties of the function. In particular, continuity allows one to calculate the derivatives of a function at any point and to determine whether the function is increasing, decreasing, or constant at a given point.   In mathematical physics, the notions of discontinuity and hemicontinuity are used to study physical systems that are neither in equilibrium nor in a steady state. A physical system may be said to be in equilibrium if the changes that occur in it are small enough relative to the system's total energy. In a steady state, the energy of the system remains constant over time. A physical system may be said to be in a hemicontinuous state if its energy cannot be described as a fixed function of its coordinates.

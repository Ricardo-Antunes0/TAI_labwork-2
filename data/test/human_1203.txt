Meredith is a Welsh given name, and a surname common in parts of Wales. It is of Welsh origin and, as a personal name, was until recently usually given to boys. Meredith has many derivatives which have become personal names and surnames as well. Etymology and history In Old Welsh (c. 800–1150) the name was usually rendered as Morgetuid or Margetiud. The exact meaning of the first element, Mere, is unclear although some Welsh scholars have translated it as "great" or "splendid". The final element of iudd has the meaning of lord, and is found in other Welsh names such as Gruffydd and Bleidd[i]udd. However, in Middle Welsh (c. 1150s–1300s) the name was most commonly spelt as Maredud and Maredudd; "in Welsh, the accent is on the penult, and this leads at times to the elision of the vowel of the first syllable," producing an early variant Mredydd, according to T.J. Morgan and Prys Morgan. Anglo-Norman scribes often used e for the first syllable and substituting the double d with a th, producing Mereduth. The forms Meredith and Meredyth are seen as early as the 14th century.

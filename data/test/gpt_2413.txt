The IML Walking Association, until 2006 the Irish Mountaineering and Walking Association, was founded in 1970. The Association is dedicated to the promotion of walking as a sport and recreation, the conservation of mountain and hill country landscapes, and the provision of support and information to walkers in Ireland.

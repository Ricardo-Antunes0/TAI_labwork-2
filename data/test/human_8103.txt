Franck Cammas (born 22 December 1972 in Aix-en-Provence) is a French yachtsman. He has lived in Brittany since his victory in the Challenge Espoir Crédit Agricole in 1994. After completing a two-year maths course for the ‘Grandes écoles’, as well as a piano academy, Franck Cammas finally opted for a career in sailing. In 1997, at the age of 24, he won the Solitaire du Figaro and a year later helmed his first trimaran christened Groupama. Despite his late entry into competition, he is one of the most talented and respected sailors in the Ocean Racing Multihull Association world. Later, Cammas was skipper of the  trimaran Groupama 2, with which he won five ORMA championships. His last trimaran, the  Groupama 3 was designed to break ocean racing records. Groupama 2 holds the record for being the fastest yacht in a transat Jacques Vabre race and Groupama 3 once broke Jules Verne Trophy, which she held for nearly two years.

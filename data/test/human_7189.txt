DO-242A is an aviation system standard published by RTCA, Incorporated. It contains minimum aviation system performance standards (MASPS) for Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B).  These standards specify operational characteristics that should be useful to designers, manufacturers, installers, service providers and users of an ADS-B system intended for operational use on an international basis.  DO-242A provides a view of the system-wide operational use of ADS-B, but does not describe a specific technical implementation or design architecture meeting these operational and technical characteristics.

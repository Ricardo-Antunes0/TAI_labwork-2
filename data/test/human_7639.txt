Borhat (in Assamese: বৰহাট) is a partially urbanised village in the eastern part of Charaideo district, Assam, separated from Namrup town in the east by the river Disang or Dilih. In the west Sapekhati , in south the Tirap district of Arunachal Pradesh, in north the Tingkhong tehsil of Dibrugarh district including the town of Namrup, Assam. The nearest towns are Sonari , Duliajan and Naharkatia. There is a small railway station named Borhat which is in the centre of the region. During Ahom rule, Borhat was known as a place for finding mineral salt. The name Borhat is originated from Bor 'বৰ' (meaning big 'ডাঙৰ' ) and hat 'হাট' (market 'বজাৰ'). There was a market place where salt was available. Salt was considered to be very precious during Ahom rule as Assam is far from the seas and people had to use only mineral salts. Modern day Borhat has several tea gardens (including Borhat Bagicha and Mahalakhi Tea Estate), some of which were founded by the British and many families have small tea plantations in their orchards.

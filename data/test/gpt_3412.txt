Abdallah al-Battal (; died in 740) was a Syrian Abbasid Caliph who reigned from 740 to 741.  Abdallah was the son of Caliph al-Walid I and his concubine, al-Qasimah bint al-Harith. He succeeded his father in 740 and was apparently pious and just. He reigned for only a year before he was overthrown by his own generals, who accused him of being incompetent and corrupt.

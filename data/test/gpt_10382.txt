In law, a special referee acts as an impartial arbitrator in disputes between parties.  A special referee is someone appointed by a court to act as an impartial arbitrator in disputes between parties. Special referees are commonly appointed in cases where the parties involved cannot agree on a neutral third party to arbitrate the dispute.  The purpose of appointing a special referee is to avoid the delay and expense of litigation. When parties cannot agree on a neutral third party, a special referee can act as the intermediary and help to resolve the dispute without any further proceedings.  Special referees are typically appointed in cases where there are several interested parties and time is of the essence. They may also be appointed when one party is unwilling or unable to participate in the dispute resolution process.  Special referees are typically appointed by the court with jurisdiction over the dispute. They are not judicial officers and do not have the power to bindingly adjudicate disputes. Rather, their role is to help facilitate a resolution of the dispute without having to go through full judicial proceedings.

Muser turned professional in 2002 and played on the Nationwide Tour for two years. He made his debut on the PGA Tour in 2004, but struggled to maintain his place on the tour. In 2006, he finished second on the money list to Ernie Els and earned his first PGA Tour card for 2007.  Muser had his best season in 2007, finishing third on the money list and winning three times on the tour: at The Barclays, The Honda Classic and The Web.

In January 2015, it was announced that Muser would miss the remainder of the 2014 season due to knee surgery.   In 2016 Muser was diagnosed with a heart condition which required open heart surgery in November

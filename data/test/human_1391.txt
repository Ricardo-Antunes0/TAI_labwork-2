On 26th Dec,2021 I ordered a bed, mattress and Almirah for 1.3 lakh for my sister's marriage . As per discussion they had to deliver on 28th Jan, 2022. Somehow they missed head part of Stash bed. They delivered incomplete product. When I said about the case , they were saying that it will take 30 days as per their service policy. On 6th Feb, 2022 marriage was there but neither shopkeeper/salesman or service person was bothering for this. They were saying that its as per policy, they can not do anything. This is a cheating case. I paid amount 20 days back and after receiving they do not care. I do not know how they made policy without considering users side. I purchased the product from Brobourne road , Kolkata branch. Although they had demo piece at their showroom but they were not fixing my problem. I have very bad experience with these sales person. shop manager was pathetic. I would request to others please take this point up before purchase. Godrej should fix this. On 4th feb,when Haldi rasm was going on ~4 pm ,I was at their showroom, struggling for resolving issue. Very bad people.

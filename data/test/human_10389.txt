Pond Meeting House is a historic Quaker meeting house off United States Route 202 in China, Maine.  Built in 1807, it is one of the oldest surviving buildings in the town, and an important element in the early life and spiritual growth of Quaker writer Rufus Jones.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Pond Meeting House stands about  north of the village of South China, on the east side of United States Route 202.  It is set near the road, just south of the main entrance to the Friends Camp, on whose grounds it is located.  It is a modest 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with gabled roof and clapboarded exterior.  A cross-gabled vestibule projects from one of the long sides, with a pair of entrances flanking a sash window, with a second sash window in the gable.  The building has simple trim; the doors have modest cornices above.  The interior of the building consists of a single large chamber, which was originally filled with pews and divided into two sections by a shutter mechanism; both the pews and shutters have been removed, and one portion of the chamber has been walled off to form a kitchen.

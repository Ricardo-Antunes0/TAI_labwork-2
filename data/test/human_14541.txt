Grenada Packet (1814): Lloyd's List reported in May 1814 that the American privateer America had captured Grenada Packet at  as Grenada Packet was sailing from Bermuda to Madeira. Another report, published in June stated that Grenada Packet had been destroyed. The United States privateer schooner York, of Baltimore, Burch, master, 14 cannons and 100 men, came upon Grenada Packet on 10 April with only two men on board, Darrell (her original master), and a Swede. At Yorks approach the prize crew from American, of Salem, had taken to Grenada Packets boats and sailed for the coast, fearing that York was a British naval vessel. Grenada Packet had a cargo of wheat that Burch estimated as being worth $8000. He took Darrell and the Swede off Grenada Packet and burnt her.

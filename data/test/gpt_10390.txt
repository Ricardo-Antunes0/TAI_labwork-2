Jaffna Fort (;  Yapanaya Balakotuwa) is an archaeological site in the city of Jaffna in Sri Lanka. It is situated in the central business district of the city and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The fort is located on a high promontory overlooking the bay of Jaffna. It was built by the Portuguese in 1505, and was captured by the Dutch in 1658. The fort remained under Dutch rule until 1796, when it was recaptured by the British. The fort was abandoned in 1815 and has since been extensively restored.  The fort is now a tourist attraction, with a museum containing artifacts from the colonial period. It is also used as a venue for cultural events.

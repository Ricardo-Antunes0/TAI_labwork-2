Stephen Hammerton (fl. 1629â€“47) was a boy composer and musician of the Elizabethan era. He is chiefly remembered for his motet, "O Lord Thy Word Is True".  Hammerton was born in 1629, the son of a musician, and probably began composing at an early age. In 1647 he died, apparently from the plague, leaving behind a motet, "O Lord Thy Word Is True", and other works.

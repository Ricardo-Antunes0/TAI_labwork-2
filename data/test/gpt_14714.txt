{{Infobox French commune |name            | image = Bayons.jpg  | caption =  Bayons is a commune in the Hautes-Pyrénées department in south-western France.   The commune has an area of about 940 hectares. It is located on the left bank of the Garonne River, about 30 kilometres north-east of Tarbes and 45 kilometres south of Toulouse. The town is located in a valley, on a plateau at an altitude of 800 metres above sea level. The town is surrounded by forests and hills.  The commune was founded in the 10th century by an abbot called Bayon. The name comes from the Latin word "bononia" meaning "a good place". The town grew rapidly, thanks to its strategic location on the road between Toulouse and Barcelona. In 1240, Bayon was burned by the Count of Foix, but it was rebuilt soon afterwards. In 1339, Bayon passed to the La Tour d'Auvergne family.  In 1590, Bayon was sacked by the troops of Henry IV of France. In 1629, it was destroyed by a storm. In 1632, it was rebuilt by Cardinal Richelieu. In 1789, it became part of the department of Hautes-Pyrénées.  Today, Bayon is a small town with a population of about 1,500 people

A supergroup is a musical group whose members are from different musical backgrounds or generations. They are usually formed for the purpose of recording a single album, but they have also been known to tour. Supergroups can be made up of either former or current members of well-known rock, pop, R&B, soul, and country music groups, or they can be completely new groups.  The first supergroup was the Blues Brothers, which consisted of John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd from the Blues Brothers movie and Louis Armstrong and Cab Calloway from the 1940s. The most recent supergroup is Fleetwood Mac, which consisted of Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie, Mick Fleetwood, and John McVie from Fleetwood Mac.

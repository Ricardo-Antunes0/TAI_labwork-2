Piast Dragon is a legendary creature in Polish mythology and folklore. It is said to be a dragon with the head of a man and the body of a dragon, or a dragon with the head and wings of a man.  The Piast Dragon is said to have been created by the first Piast king, Mieszko I. Legend has it that Mieszko I was journeying in the forest when he came across a dragon guarding a treasure. Mieszko I killed the dragon and took its treasure, which he used to fund his war against the neighboring pagans.  The Piast Dragon is also known as the Ossuary Dragon or the Dragon of Gniezno. It is said to guard the city of Gniezno, which was founded by Mieszko I, and to protect the remains of Saint Adalbert, who is buried there.

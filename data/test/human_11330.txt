FK Kolubara  is a professional football club based in Lazarevac, Belgrade, Serbia. They compete in the Serbian SuperLiga, the top tier of the national league system. History During the existence of SFR Yugoslavia, the club spent two consecutive seasons in the Second League (1983–84 and 1984–85), but mainly competed in the lower regional leagues. They would make their debut in the second tier of FR Yugoslavia football during the NATO bombing-shortened 1998–99 season, finishing fifth in Group East. The club spent three more years in the Second League (1999–2002), before suffering relegation to the Serbian League Belgrade. They achieved their biggest success by reaching the semi-finals of the 2005–06 Serbia and Montenegro Cup, losing 4–1 away at OFK Beograd. After spending six seasons in the third tier, the club won the 2007–08 Serbian League Belgrade and took promotion to the Serbian First League. They competed in the second tier for the next five years, controversially missing promotion to the top flight in the last round of the 2009–10 Serbian First League, eventually finishing in third place. In the 2020–21 Serbian First League, the club earned promotion to the Serbian SuperLiga for the first time in history.

Herbert Eustáquio de Carvalho (December 14, 1946 – October 19, 2003), better known by his stage name Herbert Daniel, was a Brazilian singer-songwriter, musician and actor.  Born in São Paulo, Daniel began his professional career in the early 1970s as a member of the Brazilian rock band Os Mutantes. He achieved international recognition with the release of his solo album Herbert Daniel in 1978. That album produced the hit single "Por Amor ao Rock" which became a popular international hit.   Daniel's subsequent albums were not as successful commercially, but he continued to perform live throughout the 1980s and 1990s. He also acted in several Brazilian movies and television shows throughout his career. He died from prostate cancer at the age of 57 in 2003.

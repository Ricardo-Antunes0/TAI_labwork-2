Caldey Priory is a Grade I-listed priory in the parish of Prestatyn, Flintshire, Wales.  The priory is located on Caldey Island, off the northwest coast of Wales. The priory was founded in 1142 by Ranulf de Gernon, 3rd Earl of Chester, and later became a Benedictine monastery. In the 12th century, it was granted to the Cistercian order. It passed through several other hands before being purchased by Sir Thomas Lipton in 1892. The priory was restored by the architect Arthur Blomfield in the Early English style in 1892-1894.   The priory is now used as a hotel and restaurant.

i-Cybie (爱赛比) is a robotic pet that resembles a dog. It was manufactured by Silverlit Toys Manufactory Ltd Hong Kong from 2000 to 2006. i-Cybie was developed for commercial distribution by Tiger Electronics. Outrageous International Hong Kong distributed the electronic pet from 2005 to 2006.  The i-Cybie robotic dog responds to sound, touch, movement, and voice commands. The toy robot can autonomously recharge its batteries using a special docking station. I-Cybie was the first mass-produced toy that used advanced voice recognition technology. Features i-Cybie has 16 built-in motors which allow 16 degrees of freedom. There are three CPU’s—the main Toshiba TMP91C815F for motion control and for mood calculation, a SunPlus Technology CPU used for audio playback, and an RSC 364 used for voice recognition and recording. i-Cybie is constructed using 1400 parts, and more than 90 feet of wire. The robot uses a suite of sensors to determine mood and behavior. Dimensions Height:  Width:  Length:  Weight: about  Light Sensor (nose)— for motion detection in "guard" mode. Infrared Obstacle Detector (chest array)—for collision avoidance and edge detection. The chest array is also used to communicate with other toys (robo-chi, i-Cybie) and for receiving remote commands. Touch Sensors (back button, head button, nose button)— influence the i-Cybie's moods and behavior. Microphones (4)—three microphones are used to hear sharp sounds and one is used to discriminate voice. The robot can localize the direction of a sharp sound and move towards it. I-Cybies can recognize spoken commands and respond in a specific manner.  Voice recognition features biometric authentication. Voice recognition is activated by the head contact sensor or by the remote control unit. Orientation Sensor—the robot can detect whether it has fallen over. The orientation sensor also contributes to the robot's mood. Encoders (12)- three per leg, position legs. Dynamic Drive feedback-it can sense when its limbs are jammed and take action to free itself. Light Sensor (back)— for use in mood and behavior calculations. The light sensor can also detect petting and can initiate behavior.

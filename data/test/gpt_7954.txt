George M. Duke (January 12, 1946 â€“ February 4, 2016) was an American jazz and rock guitarist. He was one of the most influential and celebrated electric guitarists of the 20th century.  Duke was born in Durham, North Carolina, and started playing guitar at the age of six. After moving to New York City in the early 1960s, Duke played with a variety of jazz and rock bands, including the John Coltrane Quartet, Miles Davis's Bitches Brew and The Jazz Crusaders. He also recorded with artists such as Frank Zappa, Jimi Hendrix, Carlos Santana and Pink Floyd. In 1985, Duke founded the George Duke Trio with bassist John Patitucci and drummer Paul Wertico. The trio released several albums over the next two decades. Duke retired from touring in 2003 but continued to release music commercially.  Duke died of lung cancer at his home in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California at the age of 70. He was posthumously awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2017.

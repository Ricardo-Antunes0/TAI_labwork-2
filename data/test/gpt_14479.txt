SEAC (Standards Eastern Automatic Computer or Standards Eastern Automatic Computer) was an early computer developed in the United States during World War II. It was first demonstrated to the public on October 14, 1945. It was developed by the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation as part of a government contract to speed up calculations used by the U.S. Army Air Forces.  The SEAC was one of the first computers to use vacuum tubes for its main storage and processing units. It was also one of the first computers to use magnetic tape for data storage. The SEAC was operational for only a short time, and was superseded by more powerful machines shortly after its introduction.

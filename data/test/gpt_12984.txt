Badri is a 2001 Indian Tamil-language sports drama film written and directed by Vikraman. The film stars Pandiarajan, Prabhu and Seema in the lead roles. The film had musical score by Ilaiyaraaja.  The story is set in the fictional Badrinath Athletic Club, a place where members of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) come to train. A seasoned IOA member, K. R. Vijaya (Pandiarajan), is a strict coach who expects his athletes to give their best effort at all times. When one of his athletes, Badri (Prabhu), refuses to give his all, Vijaya throws him out of the club.  Badri is subsequently drafted into the Indian National Team for the international championships in Spain. Despite initial successes, Badri begins to struggle with his performance and falls out of favour with the coaching staff. He comes back to India to compete in a local tournament and finds redemption as he leads his team to victory. In the end, Badri is reinstated into the IOA and continues to train under Vijaya, who recognises that Badri still has potential.

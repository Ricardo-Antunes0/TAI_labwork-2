Cultural pluralism is a term used when referring to the idea of different cultures having a place in society. This term is used to describe the idea that different cultures can exist together without causing conflict or any sort of negativity. The term has been used in a number of ways, but the most popular definition refers to the idea that different cultures can exist within the same society without interfering with one another. This is usually done by allowing each culture to have its own independent institutions and practices.   Cultural pluralism has been seen as a positive force because it allows for a more diverse and inclusive society. It also allows for different groups to share their culture and create new traditions without feeling threatened or attacked. In addition, cultural pluralism can help to reduce the feeling of isolation that many people experience when living in a multicultural environment.

Clara de noche (Clara at night), is a series of comic strips created in 1992 by comic book writers Carlos Trillo and Eduardo Maicas, and the cartoonist Jordi Bernet. It was published weekly in the Spanish magazine El Jueves, starting from number 772. After 1243 consecutive weeks of circulation, the series ended in 2015 in Spain. It had stopped the year before in Argentina (September 2014), where it was simultaneously published in a young persons supplement called No in the newspaper PÃ¡gina/12. Over 1,000 episodes of the comic strip were also published in the Italian magazine Skorpio. French, German, Greek and Croatian translations were also made. The series has been compiled periodically into albums, and is considered one of the most important works of the three creators. The central character is the prostitute Clara, and the cartoon reflects her amusing adventures and misadventures as a sex worker, along with the peculiar characters that get involved with her and her son Pablito.

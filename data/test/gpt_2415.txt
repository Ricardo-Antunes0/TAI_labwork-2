Jin-Quan Yu  is a Chinese-born American physicist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2007.  Yu was born in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in 1934. He earned his B.S. from Tsinghua University in 1955 and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1960. Yu then became a postdoctoral fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1960 to 1963 before joining the faculty at Princeton University where he has been a Full Professor since 1964. Yu is also a fellow of the American Physical Society.  Yu's research focuses on the fundamental principles of particle physics, with a particular emphasis on the study of subatomic particles called quarks and their interactions. He is also known for his work on the theory of high-energy collisions, which has led to important insights into the nature of elementary particles and the origins of nuclear forces.  Yu was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2007 "for his contributions to the theory of high-energy collisions and the development of quantum field theory". The prize was shared with Takaaki Kajita and Arthur L. Schawlow.

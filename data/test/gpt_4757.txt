Wong is known for his low-budget independent films and music videos, as well as his collaborations with actors and musicians.  Wong was born in Toronto, Canada, and grew up in Richmond Hill. He earned a degree in film studies from the University of Toronto in 1982. Wong's first film, a 16mm short entitled "The Fall", was screened at the Vancouver International Film Festival that year.

In the 1990s, Wong began working on music videos for artists such as The Tragically Hip and Sarah McLachlan. His most famous clip, for McLachlan's song "Angel", won an award at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards. In recent years, Wong has turned his focus back to feature films. His latest effort, "The Book of Shadows: The Blair Witch Project Remake", was released in 2016.

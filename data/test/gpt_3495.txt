A 2-in-1 PC, also known as convertible PC, is a type of personal computer that can switch between a laptop or a desktop form factor. 2-in-1s typically have a detachable keyboard/touchpad combo and display that can be used in either mode.  2-in-1s have become popular due to their portability and versatility. They can be used as a replacement for both a laptop and a desktop PC, and they offer many advantages over traditional laptops and desktops. They are lightweight and slim, making them easy to transport. They have an LCD display that is high resolution, making them suitable for use in professional environments.  2-in-1 PCs are not without their drawbacks, however. They typically have lower battery life than laptops and desktops, and they may not offer the same performance as either type of device. 2-in-1s are also more expensive than traditional laptops and desktops, which may be a barrier to their widespread adoption.

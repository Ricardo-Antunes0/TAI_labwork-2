Reactionary modernism is a term first coined by architectural historian Robert Venturi in his book, Learning from Las Vegas. Reactionary modernism is a style of architecture that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s that criticized modernist architecture for its lack of tradition and its embrace of new technologies and materials.  Reactionary modernism is characterized by a return to traditional forms and materials, a rejection of the mechanization of architecture, and a focus on the expression of emotions through the design of buildings. Common elements of reactionary modernist architecture include steeply sloping roofs, large expanses of glass, and dramatic curves and angles.

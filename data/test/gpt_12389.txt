The Piano Concerto, Op. 38, by Samuel Barber was composed in 1938. It is in three movements:   The first movement, "Allegro", is an energetic introduction in which the Piano plays a series of arpeggios.   The second movement, "Andante", is a leisurely and lyrical movement in which the Piano plays a series of chords and melodies.   The third and final movement, "Presto", is an exciting and fast-paced finale in which the Piano plays a series of rapid notes.

Dingwall Designer Guitars is a manufacturer of bass guitars and electric guitars based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. It employs the fanned-fret system started by Novax Guitars for manufacturing basses, increasing the scale length of the strings on the bass side of the guitar compared to the treble side. This design is more akin to a piano or harp, giving the bass strings length that increases the sustain. Dingwall produces 9 different models of bass guitars: 7 of them are produced out of their main shop in Saskatoon, while the remaining 2 models are manufactured in China using North American sourced materials and set-up again in Canada. The model names of the Dingwall bass guitar line-up are the Prima Artist, Z, Lee Sklar Signature, Super J, Super P, Afterburner I, Afterburner II, D-Bird series, Combustion, and NG. The company was founded in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, by Sheldon Dingwall in 1987, and its headquarters are still located there.

Climax species, also called late seral, late-successional, or climax vegetation, are plants or animals that reach the highest levels of diversity, abundance, and productivity within their ecosystems. Climax species can play a critical role in regulating the populations of other species within their communities, and can be keystone species that influence the overall functioning of an ecosystem.  Climax species are important for a number of reasons. They can play an important role in regulating the populations of other species within their communities, and can be keystone species that influence the overall functioning of an ecosystem. They can also serve as important food sources for a variety of animals, and can help to sustain biodiversity by providing resources that are not available elsewhere in the ecosystem.  There are a number of factors that contribute to the success of a climax species, and it is not always easy for a community to reach a climax state. It takes time for a community to reach its peak level of diversity, abundance, and productivity, and it often takes several generations for a community to reach its climax state. In some cases, it may be necessary for a community to go through several stages before it reaches its climax state.  Climax species are important for a number of reasons.

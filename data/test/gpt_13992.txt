John Landa Nkomo (born 22 August, 1934) is a retired South African politician who served as the Prime Minister of Rhodesia from 1979 to 1980, and as the sixth president of Zambia from 1964 to 1991.   Nkomo was born in the village of Mvuma in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. He attended primary school in Nyamira, then went on to study at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Oxford. He also spent a year at the University of Cambridge.   Nkomo became active in the African National Congress (ANC) while he was still a student, and became one of its most prominent leaders in the 1960s. In 1964 he was elected president of Zambia, defeating incumbent Kenneth Kaunda. Nkomo's rule was marked by increasing censorship and political repression, and he resigned in 1991 after losing a referendum on a new constitution. He has since retired from public life.   Nkomo has been recognised as an icon of African nationalism, and is considered one of the fathers of modern African politics. He has been awarded several honorary degrees, including an honorary doctorate from Rhodes University in 1988.

The French Internet site "Aide Ã  l'Eglise en France" (AECF) reports that Christianity is the dominant religion in Bhutan. According to the 2011 census, 81.8% of the population is Christian, with Hindus at 10.2%, Buddhists at 1.5%, and others making up the remaining 2.4%.  Bhutan has a long and complicated history with Christianity. The country was evangelized by American Baptist missionaries in the early 20th century, but it was not until after World War II that significant numbers of Bhutanese Christians became active. In 1953, Bhutan became an independent kingdom under the leadership of Jigme Singye Wangchuck. As a result of Wangchuck's religious convictions, Christianity became the state religion of Bhutan and its influence can be seen in all aspects of life.  Today, Christianity is the dominant religion in Bhutan. The official language of Bhutan is Dzongkha, and almost all public documents are written in Dzongkha as well. However, due to the country's close relationship with India, Hindi is also widely spoken. There are around 1,000 churches in Bhutan, with most of them belonging to the Baptist or Methodist denominations. The largest Christian denomination is the Presbyterian Church in Bhutan, with around 12,000 members.

The Alexander Thoirs House is the oldest surviving brick house in Wabasha, Minnesota, United States, and the earliest example of the brick merchant houses that characterized the city's 19th-century streetscape.  It was built in two phases in 1868 and 1870 for a successful local shoemaker.  The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 for having local significance in the theme of architecture.  It was nominated for its status in the city's early housing stock, its fine Greek Revival architecture, and its embodiment of the success of Wabasha's early merchant class, which helped establish the city's own commercial importance. Description The Alexander Thoirs House is a wood frame building with a brick veneer.  The main section is a two-story rectangle, with a one-and-a-half-story wing centered on one side, giving the house a "T"-shaped footprint.  The foundation is cement-plastered limestone.  A porch spans the front of the main wing and wraps around to attach to the side wing.  The house sits prominently on a corner lot facing northeast.

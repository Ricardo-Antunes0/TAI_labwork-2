Robert William Meusel (July 19, 1896 – July 5, 1978) was an American mathematician who made fundamental contributions to the theory of elliptic curves.  Meusel was born in Lawrence, Kansas, on July 19, 1896. He received his B.A. in 1916 from the University of Kansas, and his M.A. in 1917 from the University of Chicago. In 1922 he received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago under the direction of Arnold Sommerfeld.  In 1926 Meusel became a professor at Johns Hopkins University, where he remained until his retirement in 1971. During that time he served as president of the American Mathematical Society (1951), and as chairman of the mathematics department (1954–1955).  Meusel died on July 5, 1978 in Baltimore, Maryland at the age of 86.  Meusel's research focused on elliptic curves, a topic in mathematics that has applications to cryptography and other fields. His work on elliptic curves revolutionized our understanding of these curves and has had a profound impact on modern mathematics.  Meusel is also well known for his book Elliptic Curves and Cryptography (1949), which is still widely used today. In this book he provides a comprehensive introduction to elliptic curves and their applications to cryptography.

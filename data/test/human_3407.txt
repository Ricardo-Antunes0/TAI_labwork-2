Shingle Creek Crossing is a regional shopping center in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, originally known as Brookdale Center. It became the third enclosed shopping mall in the Twin Cities, after Southdale Center and Apache Plaza. The mall opened in phases beginning with Phase One in March 1962 which included anchor stores Sears and JCPenney. Phase Two opened in 1966, adding Dayton's as the third anchor. Donaldson's became the fourth anchor in September 1967. Brookdale Center was part of "The Dales", what was referred to as the four "Dale" centers circling the Twin Cities, originally developed by Dayton-Hudson Corporation.  The others are Southdale Center in Edina, Rosedale Center in Roseville and Ridgedale Center in Minnetonka. After a long decline, the mall closed in 2010 and was demolished in 2012 before being redeveloped into the Shingle Creek Crossing development. History In 1955, prior to the opening and success of Southdale Center in nearby Edina, Dayton-Hudson chose to also develop a mall in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, to be called "Northdale. " A 90-acre site in Brooklyn Center (at the crossroads of Osseo Rd, N. 57th Ave., Minnesota State Highway 100, and Shingle Creek) was chosen as the location because Dayton's believed that the area would experience the most growth in suburban Minneapolis within the next ten years. Previously, another developer was interested in the same site for a shopping center, but was rejected because of opposition from nearby land owners. Dayton's also believed that being five miles away from Apache Plaza would not make them competitors (between the two malls was the Mississippi River). By 1957 the development had been renamed Brookdale instead of Northdale, and Dayton's requests to rezone areas around the development were approved.

The Stancomb-Wills Glacier is a large glacier in the North Cascades of Washington, United States. It is long, extending from Mount Adams to Mount Hood, and has a total area of about . The glacier is named for the American mountaineers Edward Stancomb and William H. Willson, who first documented its existence in 1897.  The glacier flows generally north-northwestwards for about from its source at the northeast end of Mount Adams to its terminus at the southeast end of Hood, a distance of . Its surface is deeply indented, with a number of cirques and subsidiary glaciers branching off it in all directions. The main body of the glacier lies between two high ridges, which almost enclose it on three sides. From a point on the NE ridge about east of Mount Adams the glacier slopes down to a broad depression on the W side of Hood, which it fills up to a height of about above sea-level. Thence it rises again steeply, and after a course of about crosses the summit ridge of Hood about midway between its eastern and western extremities.  The Stancomb-Wills Glacier has been in continuous retreat since observations began in 1897. Its rate of recession has varied from year to year, but over the past fifty years or so it has averaged about per year. It is estimated that since 1937 it has lost more than half its surface area.

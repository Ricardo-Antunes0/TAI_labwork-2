HMS Discovery was the consort ship of the British Royal Navy's first expeditionary force to reach Australia. She sailed from Portsmouth on 12 May 1774, with a complement of 161 men, including the first Governor of New South Wales, Captain Arthur Phillip.  Discovery was the flagship of the expedition and carried out exploration along the east coast of Australia. On 26 January 1777 she became the first European ship to enter Port Jackson and landed the First Fleet of British settlers in Sydney. In 1778 she sailed from Sydney to Batavia (now Jakarta) to collect more settlers and returned to Sydney in January 1779. She then sailed for China and arrived at Whampoa Bay in early 1784. Discovery played an important role in the development of trade between China and Great Britain and was the first ship to bring back Chinese goods to Europe.

Operation Honorable Dragon (also known as Operation Dragon Spirit) was a United States military operation conducted by the SEAL Team Six, under the command of Admiral William H. McRaven, during the later stages of the War in Afghanistan. The operation took place in the Kunar Province of eastern Afghanistan from September 29 to October 2, 2009.  The objective of Operation Honorable Dragon was to capture or kill Hamid Karzai, the leader of Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security (NDNDS), and his bodyguard, Ali Ahmed Jalali. Karzai had been indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes in 2002, but was still considered a powerful political figure. Jalali was also indicted by the ICC, but had since fled to Iran.  The operation began with a aerial assault on a compound in Kunar Province that was believed to be Karzai's residence. The SEALs then moved in on foot and fought their way through Taliban positions to reach Karzai and Jalali. Karzai and Jalali were both killed in the operation, ending Karzai's five-year rule as president of Afghanistan.

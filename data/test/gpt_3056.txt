The RDS-2 nuclear warhead was created and developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s as a replacement for their older RDS-1 nuclear warheads. The RDS-2 is a two stage thermonuclear weapon that uses a two stage missile to deliver the warhead to its target.  The RDS-2 was first tested in 1977, and entered into service with the Soviet Union in 1979. The RDS-2 has a maximum yield of 150 kilotons, making it one of the most powerful nuclear weapons in existence. The RDS-2 is still in use by the Russian Federation, and may also be used by other countries that acquired copies of the weapon.

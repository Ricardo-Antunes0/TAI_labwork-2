Value engineering (VE) is a systematic method for optimizing the value of a product or service. It aims to identify and reduce costs, while still meeting customer expectations.  Value engineering is used in a variety of industries, including manufacturing, software development, and engineering. It has been applied to projects that are both large and small, with both commercial and military applications.  VE typically uses five steps:   1. Define the objectives of the project.  2. Identify all costs involved in meeting those objectives.  3. Reduce costs to achieve the objectives while still meeting customer expectations.  4. Test the reduction of costs to ensure that they still meet customer expectations.  5. If needed, implement any modifications to the project plan based on results of testing

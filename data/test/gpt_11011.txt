An internal link is a type of link that is embedded inside of another document. They are also known as "self-referential" links, because they point to the same location within the same document.  Internal links can be useful for linking between different sections of a document, or for linking to specific points in a text. They can also be used to create "hyperlinking" within a document, allowing readers to jump quickly from one section to another.

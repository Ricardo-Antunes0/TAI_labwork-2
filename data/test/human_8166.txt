Description Eucalyptus mitchelliana is a tree or mallee that typically grows to a height of  and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, grey to light grey or sometimes green bark, shedding in patches or strips to give the bark a mottled appearance. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves arranged that are in opposite pairs and lance-shaped to curved,  long and  wide tapering to a very short petiole. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same glossy green on both sides, linear to lance-shaped or curved,  long and  wide on a petiole  long. The flower buds are arranged in star-like clusters of seven, nine or eleven in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle  long, the individual buds sessile. Mature buds are spindle-shaped,  long and  wide with a conical to horn-shaped operculum. Flowering occurs between November and January and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped to shortened spherical capsule  long and wide with the valves near rim level or below it.

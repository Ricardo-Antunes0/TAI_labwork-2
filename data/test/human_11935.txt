The Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction, or TIMI Study Group, is an Academic Research Organization (ARO) affiliated with Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School dedicated to advancing the knowledge and care of patients suffering from cardiovascular disease.Â The TIMI Study Group provides robust expertise in the key aspects of a clinical trial, including academic leadership, global trial management, biostatistics, clinical event adjudication, safety desk, medical hotline, and core laboratories. The group has its headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts. The TIMI Study Group was founded by Eugene Braunwald, MD in 1984. Dr. Braunwald held the chairmanship until 2010, when he appointed Marc Sabatine, MD, MPH to the position. The group has conducted over 70 practice-changing clinical trials in patients with cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Among the group's most important contributions to medicine is the TIMI Risk Score, which assess the risk of death and ischemic events in patients experiencing unstable angina (UA) or a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

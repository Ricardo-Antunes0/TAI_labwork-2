The Gillard government was the Government of Australia led by Prime Minister Julia Gillard from March 2011 to November 2013. The Labour Party, led by Gillard, won a majority of seats in the House of Representatives at the 2010 Australian federal election, and formed a coalition with the Australian Greens. Following the resignation of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on 10 August 2013, Gillard was elected to succeed him as Labor Party leader and Prime Minister. She was re-elected as Prime Minister at the 2014 Australian federal election, but resigned after losing a parliamentary vote of no confidence on 23 September 2014.  The Gillard government was marked by a number of significant achievements, including passage of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) and the Australiaâ€“China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA). The Gillard government also faced a number of challenges, including the 2013 Australian financial crisis and a series of high-profile corruption scandals. In November 2013, after almost three years as Prime Minister, Gillard was replaced by Scott Morrison.

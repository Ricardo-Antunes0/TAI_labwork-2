Terrific Street was a short-lived entertainment district in New York City that operated from the 1920s until the early 1930s. The district was located on Broadway between 44th and 45th Streets and featured a variety of live entertainment, including vaudeville and burlesque.  Terrific Street was most notable for its nightlife, which was particularly popular with young people. The district was also home to several prestigious night clubs, including the Ritz and the Copacabana. Despite its popularity, Terrific Street ultimately failed due to a number of factors, including the Great Depression and competition from newer entertainment districts such as Times Square.

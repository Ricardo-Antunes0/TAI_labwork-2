The Dupleix class was a trio of armored cruisers commissioned in the late 1880s. The ships were armed with a total of eight guns and served with the French Navy until World War I. In 1916, they were seized by the British and used as auxiliary cruisers in the Battle of Jutland. After the war, the Dupleix class was sold to Greece and used as training ships until they were retired in 1933. Today, all three ships are preserved as museum ships in France.

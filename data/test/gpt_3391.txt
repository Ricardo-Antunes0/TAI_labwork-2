Terminal illness or end-stage disease is a serious condition that typically results from the progressive decline of health due to illness or injury. It is the last stage of a disease, in which the person no longer has the ability to carry out normal activities.  Terminal illness typically refers to a life-threatening illness that is not cured by medical means. Patients with terminal illness may require intensive care and support in order to maintain their quality of life. Some people choose to end their life prematurely due to the illness, while others may choose to continue living despite the illness.

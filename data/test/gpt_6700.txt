A gene signature or gene expression signature is a molecular signature of a cell or tissue that can be used to identify and characterize the cell or tissue. Gene signatures are produced by measuring the levels and patterns of specific gene products in a sample, and can be used to identify and classify cells or tissues.  Gene signatures can be used to study a variety of diseases and medical conditions, including cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes. They can also be used to screen drugs and vaccines for their effects on specific cell types or tissues, or to identify new targets for therapy.  Gene signatures are often created using microarray technology, which allows researchers to measure the levels of dozens or even hundreds of gene products simultaneously. This allows them to identify patterns in the expression of these genes that may be unique to particular cells or tissues.  There is still much research needed in order to develop accurate gene signatures for use in medicine, but the potential benefits of using such signatures are clear. By understanding the molecular profiles of individual cells or tissues, we can better target our treatments toward those most likely to benefit.

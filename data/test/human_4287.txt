The Gasparilla Pirate Festival is a large parade and a host of related community events held in Tampa, Florida almost every year since 1904. The theme of the festivities is a friendly invasion by the mythical pirate Jos√© Gaspar (also known as Gasparilla), who is a popular figure in Florida folklore even though there is no evidence that he actually existed. The centerpiece of Gasparilla is the Parade of Pirates (often referred to as the Gasparilla Parade), which is held on the last Saturday in January and is organized by Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla (YMKG), a local organization modeled after the "krewes" of Mardi Gras in New Orleans. On Gasparilla Day, members of YMKG sail across Tampa Bay aboard the Jose Gasparilla, a specially built  "pirate ship" equipped with loud mini-cannons that fire continuously during its journey. Surrounded by thousands of revelers on private boats, the pirates make their way to the Tampa Convention Center, where the mayor surrenders the key to the city in a playful ceremony. Victory secured, members of Ye Mystic Krewe are joined by dozens of other krewes and community organizations in a long "victory parade" along Bayshore Boulevard, throwing beads and other trinkets to the assembled crowds along the way. The parade route has traditionally ended in downtown Tampa, and since 2011, it has ended along the Tampa Riverwalk, where festivities continue into the nighttime hours. Gasparilla began in 1904 as a surprise "pirate invasion" on horseback during a May Day festival (the first "invasion" by sea came in 1911), and continued to be a feature of other community events until finally becoming a stand-alone event in 1913. Scheduling varied before a hiatus during World War 2, after which the parade has consistently taken place in late January or early February. The Parade of Pirates has been very popular in Tampa since its inception and has grown into the third largest parade in the United States with an average attendance of about 300,000 and an estimated impact of about $20 million on the local economy.

Cell division is the process by which the cells of an organism divide to create two new cells.  The process of cell division is essential for the survival of all living organisms. It is a continuous process that occurs in all cells, from the smallest bacteria to the largest mammals.   Cell division is controlled by a number of proteins and hormones, and is a response to changes in the cell's environment. The process begins with the cell's nucleus dividing into two identical daughter nuclei. These daughter nuclei then undergo a process of duplicating their genetic material, which results in four new cells.

Knowledge were a Jamaican roots reggae group, best known for their work in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which saw them sign to A&M Records. History The group formed in the Rema area of Kingston, in 1974, the line-up including Anthony Doyley (lead vocals and main songwriter), Delroy Fowlin (vocals) aka Bronco Knowledge, Earl MacFarlane (vocals), Michael Smith (guitar), and Michael Samuels (vocals). Doyley had previously been a member of The Classics, who had recorded for Lee "Scratch" Perry in the late 1960s. Paul Freeman joined the group later in their career. They recorded for deejay and producer Tapper Zukie, first on the "Make Faith" single, with several releases on his "Stars" label. These led to a major label deal with A&M, who issued the group's debut album, Hail Dread (produced by Zukie), in 1978. The deal with A&M proved to be short-lived, with the group's second album, Judgement, issued on the Roach label in 1980. Samuels subsequently embarked on a solo career, and Freeman set up his own 'Sunshine'  label, along with Trevor "Leggo Beast" Douglas.

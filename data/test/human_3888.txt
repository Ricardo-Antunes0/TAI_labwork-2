Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), originally called BOLD venographic imaging, is an MRI sequence that is exquisitely sensitive to venous blood, hemorrhage and iron storage. SWI uses a fully flow compensated, long echo, gradient recalled echo (GRE) pulse sequence to acquire images. This method exploits the susceptibility differences between tissues and uses the phase image to detect these differences. The magnitude and phase data are combined to produce an enhanced contrast magnitude image. The imaging of venous blood with SWI is a blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) technique which is why it was (and is sometimes still) referred to as BOLD venography. Due to its sensitivity to venous blood SWI is commonly used in traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and for high resolution brain venographies but has many other clinical applications.  SWI is offered as a clinical package by Philips and Siemens but can be run on any manufacturer’s machine at field strengths of 1.0 T, 1.5 T, 3.0 T and higher. Acquisition and image processing SWI uses a fully velocity compensated, RF spoiled, high-resolution, 3D gradient recalled echo (GRE) scan.  Both the magnitude and phase images are saved, and the phase image is high pass (HP) filtered to remove unwanted artifacts.  The magnitude image is then combined with the phase image to create an enhanced contrast magnitude image referred to as the susceptibility weighted (SW) image.  It is also common to create minimum intensity projections (mIP) over 8 to 10 mm to better visualize vein connectivity.  In this way four sets of images are generated, the original magnitude,  HP filtered phase, susceptibility weighted, and mIPs over the susceptibility weighted images.

William Stevenson (born ; date of death unknown) was a Scottish footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He began his senior career at Arthurlie, being loaned to Beith within Scotland then allowed to pursue an opportunity in the United States, where he spent a season with Providence Clamdiggers – they finished in mid-table in both parts of the 1927–28 American Soccer League season. He then returned across the Atlantic Ocean, spending one year with Third Lanark before settling at Clyde, where he was the regular goalkeeper from 1929 until 1936 when he was displaced by Jock Brown. The closest Stevenson came to a trophy during his time at Shawfield was a defeat to Rangers in the 1933 Glasgow Cup final, coming six months after losing the semi-final of the 1932–33 Scottish Cup to Motherwell. In 1938 he transferred to lower division Dunfermline Athletic, spending one standard season in Fife and one more under unofficial conditions after the outbreak of World War II before retiring.

Unfortunately, their joy is short-lived when Barbara goes into labor and their baby dies in the womb. Devastated, Barbara withdraws from John and spends her days lying in bed or wandering the house aimlessly. One day, she happens to run into her old friend Lucy, who has been married for three years to an abusive husband who has recently left her for another woman. Lucy tells Barbara about the life she now enjoys, including going out with friends, traveling, and spending time with her young son. Barbara is inspired by Lucy's happiness and decides to get up and start living again. She begins to visit Lucy more often and the two women become close friends. One day, while visiting Lucy, Barbara learns that John has been trying to see her but she has refused to see him because she is still angry at him. Barbara finally decides to go see John and they reconcile.

He became one of the most important painters of the Quattrocento Florentine school, and is chiefly remembered for his frescoes in the Studiolo of the Palazzo Vecchio. Michiel also painted a "Last Supper" for Santa Maria Novella, a "Moses" for the church of Santa Croce, and a "Crucifixion" for the church of San Miniato al Monte. He also designed several buildings in Florence, including the Palazzo Pubblico and the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi.

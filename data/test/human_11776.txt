"Dat Sexy Body" is a song recorded by Jamaican deejay Sasha. It was released in 1998, however didn't gain chart success until five years after its release. The song was composed by Sasha and Anthony Kelly who also handled production of the song under his stage name Tony "CD" Kelly. The song itself is recorded over a variation of the bookshelf riddim. A music video for the song was also filmed. Two officials remixes, one with reggaeton performer Ivy Queen and another with Fatman Scoop was also recorded and released in 2004. In 2016, the song was sampled in Zara Larsson's song "I Would Like" and in 2017, the song was sampled in Pitbull and Jennifer Lopez's song "Sexy Body". Background Sasha, a deejay, had released a single entitled "Kill The Bitch" while she was in her teens which was commercially unsuccessful. Her debut studio album, Come Again was also a flop. The remix to "Dat Sexy Body", Sasha's first commercially successful single, features the reggaetón singer-songwriter Ivy Queen. As Ivy Queen's fan base continued to grow, she attracted Sasha who invited her to record the song. According to Murray Elias of VP Records: "Ivy Queen is kind of rough and Sasha has a more feminine, playful approach, so those two styles blend well, this could be a breakthrough record for Ivy Queen, where you see the Jamaican market embracing the reggaetón vibe."

Silence (, subtitled "Lyric poems", Лирические поэмы) is a 1925 book of poems by the Russian Symbolist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky.  The book consists of eighteen poems, three of which Mayakovsky had originally written for a ballet, "The Bedbug". The remaining fifteen were published in the journal "Vremya" in 1924-1925. The poems are written in free verse and are rich in images and symbols. They explore the meaning and power of silence, both individual and social.

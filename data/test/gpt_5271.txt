Isabelle Wilhelmine Marie Eberhardt (17 February 1877 – 4 January 1961) was a German mathematician who made significant contributions to the theory of Lie groups. She was also a distinguished teacher, and her students include Kurt Gödel, Norbert Wiener and John von Neumann.  Eberhardt was born in Hamburg, Germany on 17 February 1877. She studied mathematics at the universities of Berlin, Königsberg, and Göttingen, where she received her doctorate in 1907.  From 1907 to 1911, she was a lecturer at the University of Berlin. From 1911 to 1922, she was a professor at the University of Königsberg. From 1922 to 1945, she was a professor at the University of Göttingen.  Eberhardt made significant contributions to the theory of Lie groups. Her most famous result is the Eberhardt–Schütte theorem, which states that every Lie group has a global symmetry. Her other notable results include the Eberhardt–Schütte equation and the Eberhardt–Schütte matrix equation.  Eberhardt was also a distinguished teacher. Her students include Kurt Gödel, Norbert Wiener and John von Neumann. She died in Göttingen on 4 January 1961.

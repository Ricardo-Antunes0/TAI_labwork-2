Vassilie Trunoff (1929 in Melbourne, Australia â€“ 9 January 1999) was an Australian artist, known principally for her paintings of landscapes and cityscapes.  Vassilie Trunoff was born in Melbourne in 1929 to Russian-speaking parents. Her early training was in art at the National Gallery of Victoria, where she graduated with first-class honours in 1950. She then studied at the Royal College of Art in London, where she graduated with a diploma in 1952.  Trunoff returned to Australia and worked as a teacher before starting to exhibit her work in 1961. She became well-known for her depictions of cityscapes and landscapes, often using a realistic style that has been compared to the work of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Her paintings have been exhibited around the world, and she has been awarded several awards, including the Australian National Gallery's prestigious Archibald Prize in 1984. Trunoff died in 1999 at the age of 69.

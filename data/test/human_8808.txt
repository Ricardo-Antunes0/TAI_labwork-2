Timothy Carl Means (born February 20, 1984) is an American professional mixed martial artist from Moriarty, New Mexico currently competing in the Welterweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. A professional competitor since 2004, Means has also formerly competed for King of the Cage and Legacy FC. Means is the former King of the Cage Lightweight Champion and the former King of the Cage Junior Welterweight Champion. Background Born in Wilburton, Oklahoma, and raised in New Mexico, Means began training at the age of 12, as he was a troubled kid and was taken under the wing of a local trainer. In 2004, Means was involved in a shooting incident outside of a bar and suffered a nine-inch gunshot wound in the femoral artery of his thigh. Means was prescribed painkillers and morphine, and developed a morphine dependency. After Mean's prescriptions ran out, he began experimenting with methamphetamine. A few years after Means began using meth, he found himself in trouble with the law, and was charged with aggravated assault after punching a man who broke into his home. After serving more than three years in prison early in his MMA career, Means turned his life around.

Friedrich von Adelung (February 25, 1768 – October 14, 1840) was a German classical scholar and critic. He was a leading figure in the Neoclassical revival in Germany in the early 19th century.  Friedrich von Adelung was born in 1768 in Berlin. He studied at the University of Göttingen, where he was a student of Johann Joachim Winckelmann. In 1792 he became an instructor at the University of Königsberg, where he taught until his death. He also served as Prussian cultural minister from 1829 to 1830.  Friedrich von Adelung is best known for his work on classical criticism, which he developed alongside his friend and colleague Friedrich Schiller. His most important work is the three-volume Geschichte der Classischen Philologie (History of Classical Philology), which was published between 1827 and 1832.

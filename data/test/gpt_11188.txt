In electronics and electrical engineering, a fuse is an electronic component that melts and breaks down in the presence of a high current, causing a short circuit. A fuse is typically rated for a certain current and will blow if that current is exceeded. The fuse is inserted into a circuit between the equipment needing protection (the load) and the source of power, such as an alternating current supply or a battery.  A fuse is also used as an electrical safety device to prevent overloads, fires, and other electrical accidents. Fuses are available in a variety of ratings for different applications.

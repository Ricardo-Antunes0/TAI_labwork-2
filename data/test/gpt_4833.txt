The abstract system of title transfer (German: Abstraktionstheorie) is a legal principle that holds that a title may be transferred from one person to another without any change in the underlying property. The principle is named for the German jurist Carl Schmitt, who first articulated it in his book Über die Abstraktion der Rechtsfindung (1922).  The abstract system of title transfer is a legal principle that holds that a title may be transferred without any change in the underlying property. The principle is named for the German jurist Carl Schmitt, who first articulated it in his book Über die Abstraktion der Rechtsfindung (1922). According to Schmitt, the abstract system of title transfer applies when there is no physical connection between the title and the underlying property. For example, a person may own a house, but no furniture or other belongings are actually inside the house. In this case, the house can be transferred to another person without any need for the new owner to purchase any of the furniture or other belongings that were previously inside the house.

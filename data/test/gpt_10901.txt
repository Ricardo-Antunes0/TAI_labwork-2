The Flirts were a project concept group that was active from 2003 until 2006. The group consisted of five female musicians: Alain Johannes, Beth Orton, Holly Herndon, Kim Gordon and Lydia Lunch. The Flirts released one album, "The Flirts" (2003), and one EP, "I'm Your Man" (2004).  The project was conceived by Gordon and Johannes during a recording session for Gordon's album "Under the Skin" (2002). The two were inspired by the vibrancy of female friendship and relationships and wanted to create music that reflected that. The five musicians met regularly to jam, write songs and record.  The Flirts disbanded in 2006 due to creative differences.

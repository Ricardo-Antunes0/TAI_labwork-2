The Strategikon of Kekaumenos  is a late 11th century Byzantine manual offering advice on warfare and the handling of public and domestic affairs. The book was composed between 1075 and 1078 by a Byzantine general of partly Armenian descent. In it, he offers advice, based on his own personal experience and drawing upon numerous historical examples from the events of the 11th century. It is divided in six parts:  Part 1 (Chapters 1-8) survives incomplete, as its beginning has been lost. It concerns the duties and services due to a superior lord.  Part 2 (Chapters 9-34) is the Strategikon proper, and contains advice to a general.  Part 3 (Chapters 35-71) contains advice on domestic matters, the rearing of children, management of the house and the family and social relations.  Part 4 (Chapters 72-76) contains advice on the proper course of action in the event of a revolt against the Emperor.  Part 5 (Chapters 77-88) contains the admonitions to the Emperor on the governance and defence of the state.  Part 6 (Chapters 89-91) contains advice to the autonomous local ruler (toparchÄ“s) on his dealings with the Emperor.

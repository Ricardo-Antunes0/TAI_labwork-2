Joann Kagan Downey (born October 31, 1966) is an American Democratic Party politician who represented the 11th Legislative District in the New Jersey General Assembly from 2016 to 2022. Early life Downey was born in Jersey City, New Jersey. She holds a Bachelor of Arts from Rutgers University in 1988, where she studied Political Science and English, a Juris Doctor from New York Law School in June 1991 and a Masters of Social Work from Boston University School of Social Work in 2005. After graduating from Freehold Township High School, Downey was accepted to the New Jersey State Police, inspired by her father, who was a New Jersey State Trooper. Downey ultimately decided to pursue a law degree and prosecutorial work instead. She went on to serve as Deputy State Attorney General, working in the Department of Children and Families. Downey cites this experience as the impetus that moved her to work toward her Masters in Social Work.

McKeon Park is a baseball venue in Hyannis, Massachusetts, home to the Hyannis Harbor Hawks of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL). The Hawks play on Judy Walden Scarafile Field located at McKeon Park. Saint John Paul II High School is located just to the west of the field in the old Barnstable High School building. Located in downtown Hyannis not far from Hyannis Harbor, the field originally served the adjacent former Barnstable High School and later Junior High School. It served as home to the Barnstable Townies Grid Club (Football) until it's dissolution in 1950 at which point it became home to the Barnstable Townies Baseball Club. The field was reconstructed in the late 1970s to play host to the CCBL's Hyannis Mets franchise, which joined the league in 1976. While under construction, the team played at the new Barnstable High School field. The renovated park was slated to open for the 1978 CCBL season, but unforeseen drainage problems caused a delay. The park was finally opened for the 1979 season, and was dedicated in memory of the first Secretary-Treasurer of the originally named Barnstable Townies Baseball Club, and longtime Barnstable school committee member and athletic booster John McKeon. Son K.C. McKeon threw the opening pitch during the inaugural game.

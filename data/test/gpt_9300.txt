The Peace Ship was the common name given to the vessel that served as the main diplomatic transport of the United States during the late 1930s and 1940s. She was also known as the USS George Washington, after the first U.S. president.  The Peace Ship was commissioned in late 1938 and made her inaugural voyage from New York to Le Havre, France, on May 16 of that year. She served as the main diplomatic transporter for U.S. presidents and their administrations for over a decade, making over fifty voyages to twenty-six different countries. Her last voyage was in September 1949, and she was retired from service shortly thereafter.   The Peace Ship is now a museum ship in Baltimore, Maryland.

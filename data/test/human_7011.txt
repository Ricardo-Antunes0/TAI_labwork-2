Later important works include  (Some Notes on the Helping Words) by Liu Qi  and  (Explanations of the Articles Found in the Classics) by Wang Yin-Zhi , both published during the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911). These works focus on particles in the Confucius classics. Particles used in the vernacular literature did not draw much attention. The first work covering the particles found in the vernacular literature,  (Compilation and Explanations of the Colloquial Terms Found in Classical Poetry and Operas) by Zhang Xiang , appeared posthumously in 1953.

"Misunderstanding" is a song by English rock band Genesis. It was released as the lead single from their tenth studio album, ...And Then There Were None, on 10 September 2009. The song was written by the band's drummer Phil Collins and produced by the band's guitarist Steve Hackett.  The song is about a man who is having an affair with a married woman and is unaware of her husband's suspicions. The husband tracks down the woman and confronts her, leading to a fight that ends in the man's death.   The song has been described as "a brooding ballad with heavy guitars" and "an emotional powerhouse". It has been praised for its lyrics and melody, but criticised for its similarity to other Genesis songs.

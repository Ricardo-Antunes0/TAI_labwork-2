Kunstnerhjemmet (literally "The Artists' Home") on Gothersgade, in central Copenhagen, Denmark, is a former residence and art school that has been used as a museum since 1908. The building was designed by the architect Ludvig Ejsing and is a well-known example of Nordic Classicism.  Kunstnerhjemmet was built in 1877 for the brewer J.C. Jacobsen on the site of a garden belonging to Countess Juliana Maria Frederikke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The building was originally used as a brewery, but it soon became known as an artists' residence, and it served as one until 1908. In that year, Kunstnerhjemmet was acquired by the state and converted into a museum. The museum has been in continuous operation since then.  The museum has an extensive collection of Danish and international art, including works by painters such as C.M. von Hausswolff, P.C. Skovgaard-Petersen, Einar Wegener and J.H.W. Jacobsen as well as sculptures by Thorvald Bindesb√∏ll and Bertel Thorvaldsen. It also has a large collection of Danish modern art, including paintings by Anselm Kiefer and Joseph Beuys.

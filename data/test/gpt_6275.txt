Nathaniel Dwayne Hale (August 19, 1969 â€“ March 15, 2007) was an American rapper, actor and record producer. He was best known as a member of the hip hop group 2 Live Crew.  Hale was born in San Francisco, California. After moving to Miami, Florida as a teenager, he met Luther "Luke" Campbell and Fresh Kid Ice, who convinced him to start rapping. The trio formed the group 2 Live Crew and released their first album in 1989. The album was banned by the US government because its lyrics were considered obscene.  Hale became well-known for his work with 2 Live Crew, which had hits such as "Pop That Pussy", "Move S**t Out", and "As Long As You Love Me". He also had a solo career, with hits such as "Gin and Juice" and "Move S**t Out". In 2002, he was diagnosed with liver cancer and died three years later at the age of 40.

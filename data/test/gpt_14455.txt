Gaganyaan (Sanskrit IAST: gagan-yƒÅna; ) is an Indian space mission proposed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to be launched in the early 2020s. The mission is intended to study the outer space environment, including the moon and planets, and carry out other related research.  The project was first proposed in 2000, but has faced several delays. ISRO chairman A. S. Kiran Kumar said in February 2019 that the mission was "on track" and would be launched "before the end of this decade".  Gaganyaan will be India's first manned space mission and its first inter-planetary mission. It will be launched on a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk III), which is being developed by ISRO. Gaganyaan will have a payload of 3,000 kilograms (6,600 lb), including a crew of two astronauts: a pilot and a co-pilot. The spacecraft will have an all-electric propulsion system and will use solar energy to orbit Earth.

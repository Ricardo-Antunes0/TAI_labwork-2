The Episcopal Palace , formerly known as the Palace of the Bishop of Strasbourg, is a historical palace located in the city of Strasbourg, Alsace, France. The palace, which is currently used as a conference center, was built between 1755 and 1760 for the Bishop of Strasbourg. It is one of the finest examples of Rococo architecture in France.  The palace is made up of three sections: an entrance pavilion, the main body of the palace, and a chapel. The entrance pavilion is an asymmetrical building with a Ionic portico supported by Doric columns. The main body of the palace has a symmetrical facade with two rows of windows on each side. The chapel, which is also the most ornate part of the palace, has a Baroque fa√ßade with a gilded dome. The interior of the palace contains many fine examples of Rococo decoration, including several marble statues.  The Episcopal Palace is currently used as a conference center. It is open to the public daily from 9:00am to 5:00pm except on Christmas Day and New Year's Day.

In computer science and mathematical logic, satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) is a problem in propositional logic that can be solved in polynomial time. It is a generalization of the classical problem of satisfiability, which asks whether a given propositional formula is satisfiable, or whether there exists a set of variables such that the formula is true for all possible assignments to those variables. A solution to SMT is often used to prove the satisfiability of other formulas.  Satisfiability modulo theories arise naturally in the context of deductive verification, where we are asked to determine whether a certain logical statement is satisfiable. For example, we might want to know whether the following statement is satisfiable:  If P then Q  This statement can be seen as an equation: if P then Q means that if P is true then Q is also true. We can ask ourselves whether this equation is satisfiableâ€”that is, whether there exists a solution to it that satisfies all of its terms. If we can find a solution, then we know that the statement is true; if we cannot find a solution, then the statement might be false.  SMT problems arise when we ask ourselves something more general than this: we ask whether any given propositional formula is satisfiable, not just whether an equation containing this formula is satisfiable. For example, consider the following propositional formula:  P\lor Q  This formula can be seen as an equation involving two variables (P and

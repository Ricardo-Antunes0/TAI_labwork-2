The Zebra was a three-masted ship, built in 1839 by M. L. de Boinville, of La Rochelle, France. She sailed under the French flag and was wrecked in 1843 on a reef near Mauritius.  The Zebra was one of the earliest three-masted ships to be built, and she was also one of the largest. She was built for the French trade route between Europe and Asia, and she was equipped with a large number of cannons in order to protect her cargo from pirates.  The Zebra was wrecked on a reef near Mauritius in 1843, and all of her crew were lost.

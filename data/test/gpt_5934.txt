A multi-mode interferometer (MMI), also known as a heterodyne interferometer, is an instrument used in optical communication and astronomy. It is a type of interferometer that uses two or more different optical modes to measure the interference of waves.  Multi-mode interferometers are used in optical communication systems because they provide a more accurate measurement of the phase difference between two waves than single-mode interferometers. They are also used in astronomy to measure the wavelength of light using the principle of interference.  A multi-mode interferometer consists of two or more input mirrors that are placed at right angles to one another. The waves travelling through the interferometer are reflected off the mirrors and then recombined, creating an interference pattern. The distance between the mirrors can be adjusted to change the spacing of the interfering waves and thereby measure the phase difference between them.  Multi-mode interferometers are used in a number of applications, including telecommunications, spectroscopy, and astronomy. They are particularly useful for measuring small phase differences between waves, which makes them a good choice for optical communications systems.

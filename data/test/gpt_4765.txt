The Serbian Revival  or Serbian national revival, refers to a period of cultural revival in Serbia during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The revival was initially inspired by the ideas of the Romantic writer and philosopher Vuk Karadžić and took hold in the 1860s and 1870s. It was characterized by a renewed interest in traditional Serbian culture and an increase in the use of the Serbian language. The revival had a significant impact on Serbian art, literature, music, and architecture, and helped to strengthen ties between the Serbian people and their historical homeland.  The Serbian Revival was largely driven by Serbs who sought to reassert their national identity and re-establish their place in the Balkans after centuries of Ottoman rule. It also served as a response to growing nationalism across Europe, which saw Serbia as a key example of a nation that had successfully resisted foreign domination. Numerous Serbian artists, writers, and architects participated in the revival, which helped to create a unique Serbian style that is still popular today.

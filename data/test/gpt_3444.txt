Rhythm Plate are predominantly a deep house music format that originated in the early 1990s. The rhythm plate is a single-sided vinyl record that has a groove on one side and a series of grooves on the other. When played, the groove on the side with the rhythm plate's groove plays continuously while the other groove plays once every 8 beats or 16 bars.  The rhythm plate was first popularized by US producer and DJ Larry Levan in the early 1990s. The format was especially popular in Europe, where it was used by producers such as Sven Vath, Laurent Garnier, and Stuart Price. In 2002, Levan released "Rhythm Plate: The Album", an album consisting entirely of rhythm plates.

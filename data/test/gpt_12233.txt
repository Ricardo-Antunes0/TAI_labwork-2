The Maurice J. Tobin Memorial Bridge (formerly the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge) is a suspension bridge that carries traffic across the East River in New York City. The bridge has two towers, each 421 feet (128 m) high, and is the world's tallest suspension bridge outside of China.  The Bronx-Whitestone Bridge was named for Maurice J. Tobin, the founder and chairman of the General Motors Corporation. Construction on the bridge began in 1929, and it opened to traffic on May 15, 1935. The bridge was originally designed as a double-decked bridge with two steel towers, but one of the towers was replaced in 1974 with a single tower. The original towers were designed by Ralph E. Parsons and Associates and were based on the design of the Eiffel Tower.  The Bronx-Whitestone Bridge is a part of the Interstate Highway System and has five lanes in each direction. The toll plaza is located on the south tower and has eight pay lanes and four express lanes. The total cost of construction was $25 million.

At the end of the American Civil War, the states of the Confederacy were in shambles. Georgia had been a staunch Confederate state, and its governor, John Bell Hood, had led the Confederate army to victory at the Battle of Atlanta. After the war, however, Hood was captured by Union troops and executed.  The Reconstruction era in Georgia began with the election of 1868. The Republican Party, which had been banned in the Confederacy, emerged as the dominant political force in the state. The Republicans sought to rebuild the state along lines that would reflect the principles of the Reconstruction period. They worked to improve education and economic opportunities for Georgians, and they abolished slavery.  Despite these efforts, Reconstruction was difficult for many Georgians. They faced discrimination from both white Democrats and black Republicans. In 1871, white Democrats regained control of the state legislature and re-imposed segregation laws. This period of Reconstruction ended in 1877 with the election of Rutherford B. Hayes as president of the United States.

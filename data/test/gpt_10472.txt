The Turtles are an American rock band formed in the late 1960s. The band consisted of brothers Michael and John Lechero, Vern "Vernon" Young, Mark "Marky" Markowitz, and drummer Bill "Rusty" Smith.  The Turtles first emerged on the national scene in the early 1970s, with their self-titled debut album. After two more successful albums, the band's popularity began to wane in the early 1980s. In 1987, however, they released their comeback album, Happy Together. The Turtles continued to tour and record sporadically until 2001, when they retired from active performing.  The band has been inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.

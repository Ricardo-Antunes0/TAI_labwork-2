Jerzy Karol Koziołkowski (20 March 1911 – 21 November 1963) was a Polish composer and pianist. He is considered one of the leading composers of the 20th century.  Born in Warsaw, Koziołkowski studied at the Warsaw Conservatory with Wanda Landowska and Kazimierz Kord. He won First Prize in the 1937 Warsaw Autumn Festival and Second Prize in the 1938 Warsaw Autumn Festival. In 1940, he was drafted into the Polish Army and served in the Polish Army during World War II. After the war, he resumed his studies at the conservatory and graduated in 1948 with First Prize.  Koziołkowski's early works were influenced by serialism and are often referred to as neoclassical. Later in his career, he began to explore more experimental techniques, culminating in his masterpiece, the opera "The Dream of Gerontius" (1958), which is considered a landmark of 20th century classical music. Koziołkowski also composed music for film, ballet, and chamber music. He was awarded the prestigious Polonius Prize in 1958. He died of cancer in 1963 at the age of 53.

John "Eric" Davidson  (May 10, 1915—September 9, 2009) was one of the last survivors of the Halifax Explosion. He was two years old when he was blinded by the Halifax Explosion on December 6, 1917.  At the time of his death in 2009, Davidson was the penultimate living survivor with permanent injuries from the Halifax Explosion, which killed more than 1,600 people. Davidson was born to parents Georgina (née Williams) and John William Davidson. He was blinded by shattered glass in the explosion, which occurred due to the collision between the SS Mont-Blanc and the SS Imo. At the time of the accident, Davidson was in his family's living room with his mother and sister. He was playing with his toy train on the window sill. The family was alerted to the collision by smoke rising from the harbour. Davidson was facing the glass windows when the blast occurred. The force of the explosion shattered the glass, completely blinding him.

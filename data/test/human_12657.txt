The "Internal Supervision Regulation" (ISR)  was promulgated in 2004 to institutionalize the Communist Party of China's (CPC) inner-party supervision system, which is enforced by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. History The inner-party supervision system was not formalized during Mao Zedong's rule. The leadership emphasized subjective responsibility, and mobilized members on moralistic campaigns to combat corruption. This changed with Mao's death and Deng Xiaoping's ascension to power. The Dengist approach differed from Mao's in that it sought to establish a supervision system based on formal procedures and party regulations. This was a thoroughgoing change, since the CPC had been accustomed (and still is to some degree) the "rule of man" rather than the "rule of law" (law in the sense of party by-laws). The main problem under Mao could be argued was democratic centralism and how it was interpreted. Democratic centralism was defined as "centralism on the basis of democracy and democracy under centralized guidance". In an environment in which formal definitions, institutional design and procedures were relegated to lesser importance, and those of subjective responsibility and personal ethics were emphasized, men dominated institutions. Ting Gong argues that democratic centralism under Mao "was used to justify the extraordinary authority of its leading officials over ordinary members without subjecting the former to any institutionalized supervision." These problems, the strength of individual politicians and the weaknesses of internal party institutions, may have led to the Cultural Revolution and what the CPC considers as excessive leftism of the 1960s and 1970s.

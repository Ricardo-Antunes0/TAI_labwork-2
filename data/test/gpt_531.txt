Anne L. Plant is an American biochemist. She is the Founding Director of the Institute for Basic Biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego.  Plant was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on January 12, 1951. She received a B.S. in chemistry from Case Western Reserve University in 1973 and her Ph.D. in pharmacology from the University of California, Davis in 1978. After postdoctoral work at the University of Utah and Johns Hopkins University, she joined the faculty of UC San Diego in 1988.  Plant's research focuses on biochemistry and pharmacology of proteins and peptides. She is particularly known for her contributions to the understanding of how proteins interact with other molecules, and for her work on the role of protein folding in drug action. Her laboratory has developed a number of new methods for studying protein structure and function, and she has also developed novel approaches to treating diseases that involve malfunctioning proteins.  Plant is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and she has received numerous awards and honors, including the McKnight Award for Excellence in Teaching from UC San Diego in 2010, the American Chemical Society's Arthur C. Cope Award for Outstanding Achievements in Chemical Research from the ACS in 2007, and the Boehringer Ingelheim Foundation Award for Basic Research from Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals in 2001. She was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006.

The yellow-eared parrot (Ognorhynchus icterotis) is an Old World parrot found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Middle East, India, and parts of Southeast Asia. It is the only member of the genus Ognorhynchus.  The yellow-eared parrot is a medium-sized parrot with a large head, long tail, and broad wings. It is mostly green with a yellow patch on the cheek, and a red or orange bill. The yellow-eared parrot is often confused with the red-cheeked parrot, but can be distinguished by its yellow patch on the cheek, red bill, and smaller size.  The yellow-eared parrot is omnivorous, eating insects, fruits, and seeds. It nests in tree cavities or on the ground. The yellow-eared parrot is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation.

ViziApps is an online mobile application platform for creating native and web mobile applications for the iPhone, iPad and Android smartphones and tablets. The online service enables customers to build mobile apps without coding including both the design of the user experience and the design of data interfaces from many data source types. ViziApps also enables design extensions in Javascript. The online ViziApps Studio is provided by ViziApps, Inc. based in Wellesley, Massachusetts. History ViziApps was launched in November 2010 by Wellesley, Massachusetts startup MobiFlex Inc. Company CTO Michael Kuperstein worked on ViziApps technology while at his previous company, Metaphor Solutions Inc., a provider of interactive voice response solutions. Company CEO George Adams and Michael Kuperstein co-founded MobiFlex, Inc. to focus that technology on mobile app creation with no coding. They launched the ViziApps Studio in November 2010, after a 6-month private beta. Prior to that, Adams was CEO of network security firm Tectia Inc. The two men met at an IEEE Boston entrepreneurs meeting in September 2009. In December 2011, Kofax Inc. reported that they had invested $500,000 in MobiFlex and would use ViziApps as the platform for their mobile document capture applications solutions. MobiFlex was reportedly the first application creation service to enter the Google Apps Marketplace in March 2011. In February 2012, CEO Adams commented that ViziAppsâ€™ customer base had grown from approximately 2,000 to 3,500 companies.

The Segeju are an ethnic and linguistic group inhabiting the central highlands of Ethiopia. They are believed to have migrated from the Horn of Africa in the first millennium AD. The Segeju speak a Semitic language, which is closely related to Eritrean and Tigrean.  The Segeju are one of the largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, numbering over 300,000 people. They occupy a large area in the central highlands, stretching from the eastern edge of the Ethiopian Plateau to the Shewa Province. Most Segeju live in rural areas, but there are also sizable communities in Addis Ababa and Jimma.  The Segeju are monotheistic and adhere to a traditional religion. They are divided into clans, which play an important role in their society. The Segeju are highly agricultural, growing a variety of crops including coffee, maize, and jute. They also raise livestock, including cattle, sheep, and goats. The Segeju have long been involved in trade, and they are famous for their handicrafts, including baskets, pottery, and metalwork.

Saber Interactive Inc. is an American video game developer founded in 2001 with headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Saber was acquired by Embracer Group in February 2020, making the studio a direct subsidiary. The company's portfolio includes World War Z, NBA Playgrounds, SnowRunner, Crysis Remastered and WWE 2K Battlegrounds among others. The company employs over 1350 people. History  Saber Interactive was founded in 2001 by Andrey Iones, Matthew Karch, and Anton Krupkin. The founders envisioned creating a studio that could develop great games at a price that the average gamer could afford. Together they created a 3D engine from scratch, gathered a team of artists from Saint Petersburg, Russia and began working on their first game, Will Rock. After the release of Will Rock, Saber developed their proprietary game engine, Saber3D, which was used in their second title, TimeShift (2007). The Saber3D engine has since been continuously updated and evolved for use in current games.

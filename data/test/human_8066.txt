The  ("lightning serpent") is a lightning spirit and legendary creature in the mythology of the Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) people of the Canadian Pacific Northwest Coast. According to legend, the  is both an ally and a weapon of the thunderbirds, employed by them in the hunting of whales. They are described as huge serpents with heads as sharp as a knife and tongues that shoot lightning bolts. A blow from a  injures a whale enough that the hunting thunderbird can carry it away as prey. The  is variously described as dwelling among the feathers of the thunderbirds to be unleashed with a flap of the wings, or inhabiting the inland coastal waters and lakes frequented by the Nuu-chah-nulth people. Cultural Significance Because thunderbirds are said to use the  essentially as harpoons, the lightning serpent is commonly associated with whaling in Nuu-chah-nulth culture. Whalers who carry the skin of this mythological creature in their canoe are said to have luck in whaling. British sailors visiting the Pacific Northwest in 1791 reportedly saw representations of the  painted on the sides of canoes. Images of the  also appear in petroglyphs on the coast of British Columbia and as decorations on whaling harpoons.

The squadron was first activated during World War II and served in the European Theater of Operations under the 474th Fighter Group, where it earned the Distinguished Unit Citation.  After V-E Day in 1945, the 428th served briefly with the occupation forces in Germany before returning to the United States for inactivation.  The squadron was again activated as the 428th Fighter-Bomber Squadron in 1952 to replace an Air National Guard unit serving in the Korean War and earned a second Distinguished Unit Citation in that conflict.  Following the truce ending the Korean War, the squadron returned to the United States, frequently deploying to Europe.  As the reactivated 428th Tactical Fighter Squadron under the 474th Tactical Fighter Wing, in 1968 it deployed to Thailand to support the Vietnam War and again, in 1973, to Thailand to support combat operations in the Vietnam War.  The squadron was inactivated in 1989.

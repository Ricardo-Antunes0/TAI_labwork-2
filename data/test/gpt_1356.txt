Jamie Callender (born January 9, 1965) is an American writer and journalist, who has written for The New York Times Magazine, The Atlantic, and GQ.  Callender was born in Washington, D.C. to a father who was the executive editor of Newsweek magazine and a mother who was an artist. She was raised in the affluent suburbs of Bethesda, Maryland. After graduating from Oberlin College in 1986, she moved to New York City to study at Columbia Journalism School.   Callender started working as a journalist in 1987 at the Washington City Paper, where she covered city politics and the District of Columbia's burgeoning nightlife scene. In 1990, she moved to The New York Times Magazine where she wrote about popular culture and women's issues for the next thirteen years. She also wrote about food, travel, and art for the magazine.   In 2003, Callender left the Times Magazine to write a book about Elizabeth Taylor. The book was never published but it formed the basis for her 2006 article for The Atlantic magazine, "The Star-Crossed Lover: A Portrait of Elizabeth Taylor".   Callender left The Atlantic in 2006 to become a staff writer at GQ magazine where she wrote about fashion and style. She has also written articles for Slate, The Daily Beast, and Vogue.   In January 2018, Callender was fired from her position as a staff writer at GQ after allegations of sexual harassment were made against her by six women spanning three decades.

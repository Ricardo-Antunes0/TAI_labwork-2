Beatriz Barba Ahuactzin (16 September 1928 – 5 December 1992) was a Mexican artist who was one of the most important figures in the Mexican conceptual art movement of the 1960s and 1970s.  Born in Mexico City, Beatriz Barba Ahuactzin studied at the National School of Painting and Sculpture (Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura) from 1946 to 1951, under the tutelage of Professor José Vasconcelos. In 1954 she travelled to Paris, where she continued her artistic training at the École des Beaux-Arts under Fernand Léger and Lucien Freud. On her return to Mexico in 1956, she began exhibiting her work at leading art venues throughout the country, including the Salón Nacional de Bellas Artes and the Palacio de Bellas Artes.  In 1963 Barba Ahuactzin co-founded the influential Grupo Mutua Madero with fellow artists Gustavo Castro, Silvia Rivera and Jorge Martínez de la Torre. The group was instrumental in promoting Mexican conceptual art internationally, staging events such as "Poster Symposium" (1963) and "Third Interdisciplinary Symposium on Conceptual Art" (1968). Their most significant achievement was the creation of the influential magazine "Actualidad", which they published between 1964 and 1978.  Barba Ahuactzin died of a heart attack in Mexico City at the age of 61. Her body was cremated

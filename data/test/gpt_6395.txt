The Ambies (or the Awards for Excellence in Ambient Architecture) were first awarded in 1987. The Ambies are an international award for excellence in ambient architecture. The jury is composed of architects, engineers and other experts in the field.  The Ambies are awarded annually to projects that have shown an exemplary commitment to creating spaces that are both comfortable and stimulating to live and work in. The jury looks for projects that have been creative in their approach, innovative in their materials and techniques, and well-executed.  The Ambies are the only international award dedicated exclusively to ambient architecture. They reflect the growing trend toward designing environments that are not just functional but also comfortable, inspiring and relaxing.

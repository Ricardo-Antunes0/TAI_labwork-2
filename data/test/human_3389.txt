Araçá Azul (Portuguese for "blue Cattley guava") is the fifth studio album by Caetano Veloso, released in November 1972 by Philips Records. The album was recorded shortly after Veloso returned from his exile in London. Araçá Azul is Veloso's most experimental album to date, influenced in part by the poetics of invention of the Brazilian concrete poetry movement and the experiences in popular music by Walter Franco. It was negatively received by the market upon its release, and is Veloso's lowest-selling album despite receiving critical acclaim. Background After an exile of 2 years in London, Veloso recorded Araçá Azul in São Paulo over a single week at Eldorado Studio, the only studio in Brazil equipped with 8-channel recording technology at that time. Veloso reports that he made the record alone, with help from a technician and his assistant, under permission of then president of PolyGram, André Midani. He used experimental techniques to record the album, recording "Épico" in an avenue in São Paulo.

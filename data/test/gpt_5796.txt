Levee Town is the seventh studio album by American pop rock band Fall Out Boy. The album was produced by longtime collaborator and friend John Feldmann, and was recorded at his studio in Nashville, Tennessee.  The album's title is a reference to the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans, which was devastated by the levees failures during the Hurricane Katrina disaster in 2005. The song "New Orleans" is about the band's experiences playing there following the storm.  "Levee Town" has been described as a "return to form" for Fall Out Boy, with some praising its production and others calling it their "most experimental" album to date. The band embarked on a world tour in support of the album in early 2019.

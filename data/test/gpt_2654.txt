The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire. The first emperor, Augustus, was the first king of Rome and its first emperor. The title was later revived by the German emperor Otto I in 962, and acquired its modern meaning under the rule of the Holy Roman Empire.  The office of Roman emperor was not hereditary; instead it was awarded to a member of the imperial family on the death or abdication of the previous emperor. The Roman imperial dynasty continued until the death of Constantine XI in 1453.  The Roman imperial office was not a pure monarchy; the emperor was only one member of the ruling triumvirate of executive magistratesâ€”the other two being the praetorian prefect and the consul. The triumvirate was responsible for implementing laws and maintaining public order. The power of the emperor did not extend to life-or-death decisions. In fact, it was rare for an emperor to make such a decision on his own.  The Roman imperial office was nevertheless an extremely powerful position. The emperor controlled all military units within the empire, and his word was law. He could also declare war, make peace, and appoint or dismiss officials at will. In addition, he could control important aspects of Roman religion and society.

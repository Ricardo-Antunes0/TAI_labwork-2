In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), color confinement, often denoted by the symbol Σ, is a property of quarks and gluons that governs the distribution of their masses and charges. It is analogous to the more familiar confinement of particles in nuclear matter.  Quantum chromodynamics is the theory that describes the strong nuclear force. It is one of the four known fundamental forces of nature, together with the weak force, electromagnetism, and gravity. QCD is based on the idea that elementary particles are composed of quarks, which are themselves made up of three quark flavors (up, down, and strange).  The strong force is a short-range interaction between quarks. It binds them together into protons and neutrons and is responsible for the nucleus's mass. The strong force operates over a range of distances much shorter than that covered by the weak force, so it is very effective at holding together atoms and molecules. However, it does not have the power to break them apart.  The color confinement parameter Σ governs how much quarks are forced to occupy certain energy levels within their atomic nuclei. This affects the properties of these nuclei, such as their masses and charges. In extreme cases, Σ can lead to the formation of new types of particles called mesons.

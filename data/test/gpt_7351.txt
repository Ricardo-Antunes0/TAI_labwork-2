Conformal geometric algebra (CGA) is the geometric algebra of conformal field theories (CFTs), and is a powerful tool for solving CFT problems. It allows one to represent arbitrary CFTs as conformal maps between different conformal spaces, and to calculate properties of these maps in terms of the conformal structure and the geometry of the spaces involved.  Conformal geometric algebra was introduced by Jean-Marie Poirel and Jean-Pierre Serre in 1982, and has since become a widely used tool in the field of CFTs. It has been used to solve many important problems in CFT theory, including the calculation of the solutions to CFT equations, the determination of the conformal field theories that generate specific types of fields, and the study of interacting fields.

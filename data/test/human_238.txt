"Abbottabad" is a poem by Major James Abbott (1807â€“1896), who wrote the work about his experience of living in the area before leaving it. He was impressed by beauty of the area. The Pakistani city Abbottabad, which he founded (then capital of the Hazara District of British India), is named after him. A plaque commemorating his poem is displayed at Lady Garden Park within the city. The poem has been criticised as being poorly written, in the manner of William McGonagall's substandard verse. Poem text I remember the day when I first came here   And smelt the sweet Abbottabad's air The trees and the ground covered with snow   Gave us indeed a brilliant show To me the place seemed like a dream   And far ran a lonesome stream The wind hissed as if welcoming us   The pine swayed creating a lot of fuss And the tiny cuckoo sang it away   A song very melodious and gay I adored the place from the first sight   And was happy that my coming here was right And eight good years here passed very soon   And we leave you perhaps on a sunny noon Oh Abbottabad we are leaving you now   To your natural beauty do I bow Perhaps your winds sound will never reach my ear   My gift for you is few sad tears I bid you farewell with a heavy heart   Never from my mind will your memories thwart

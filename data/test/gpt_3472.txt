The Edict of Torda was a decree issued by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I in 535 AD, which prohibited the use of the Gothic language in the eastern Roman Empire. The decree was issued as part of a series of measures aimed at suppressing the Goths, a nomadic people who had invaded and settled in the eastern Roman Empire in the late 4th century. The ban on the use of Gothic was intended to discourage Goths from learning and speaking their language, which would make it harder for them to assimilate into Roman society.

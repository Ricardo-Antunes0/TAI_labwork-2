The "Beep" (also referred to as the "Beepville Locomotive") was a steam locomotive that operated on the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  The locomotive was built by the Montreal Locomotive Works in 1892 and numbered 8295. It was donated to CPR in 1912 by the Beep family, who had operated a fruit and vegetable business in Beepville, Ontario. The locomotive was used mainly on secondary lines, and was retired in 1944. It was sold to a logging company in 1949 and later scrapped.

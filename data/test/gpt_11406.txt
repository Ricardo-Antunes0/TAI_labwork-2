Caladenia cairnsiana, commonly known as the zebra orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia.  The zebra orchid is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single green leaf which is long and wide. The flowers are white with a purple tinge and are long. The plant grows in colonies near the base of trees.  The zebra orchid was first formally described by John Lindley in 1835 and the description was published in "A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony". The specific epithet ("cairnsiana") honours Thomas Cairns who collected the type specimen.

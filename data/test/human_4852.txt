Edward John Ziemba (born May 2, 1932) is a Canadian former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1975 to 1981 who represented the downtown Toronto riding of High Parkâ€”Swansea. Background Ziemba was born in Regina, Saskatchewan and came to Toronto as a young boy. In the 1950s he adopted a new name and was known as Eddie John Harris. Ziemba said, "It was a good way to do business, to adopt an Anglicized name." Operating under this name he worked as an amateur boxer, a television repairman and a private investigator. He also operated a ladies fashion store on Bloor Street West. When he married he signed the licence as Edward Harris, but he decided to revert to his original name when his first child was born. These revelations did not come to light until after Ziemba was elected to the provincial legislature. Morton Shulman who preceded Ziemba as the member for High Park-Swansea stood by him. Shulman said, "I know nothing disreputable about him. He is a dedicated socialist and temperance man."

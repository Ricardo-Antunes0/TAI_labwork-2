Railroad police or railway police (also called railway security or railway patrols) are law enforcement officers who are employed by railways and other railway-related companies to maintain law and order on railway properties and enforce railway regulations.  The first railway police were employed in the United Kingdom in 1846. In the United States, they were first employed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1851. Originally, they were assigned to patrol the tracks, stop trains for safety violations, and investigate crimes that occurred on railways. Over time, their duties have expanded to include other areas of law enforcement, such as investigating terrorist threats and responding to natural disasters.  Railway police are typically organized into small units known as "policing districts." Each policing district is assigned a specific area of responsibility, which includes the management of railroad property and the enforcement of railway regulations. The districts are also responsible for the training of new railway police officers.  Railway police are generally well-trained and experienced law enforcement officers. They typically possess a degree in law enforcement or a related field, and many have experience working in a military or police force. They are typically equipped with modern firearms and other equipment necessary for their duties.

Broadcasting is the distribution of audio or video messages, typically via radio waves or television. It is an important medium for the delivery of news and information, and is also used for entertainment purposes.  Broadcasting began with amateur signals, which can be traced back to the early 1800s. In 1837, Samuel Morse developed a telegraph system that could send messages over long distances. This technology allowed for the dissemination of news and information quickly and easily. Soon after, Alexander Graham Bell developed a telephone system that allowed people to talk to each other without having to use Morse code.  The first broadcast television station, W2XBS in New York City, went on the air on July 1, 1941. The commercial broadcasting industry began to take off in the 1950s with the development of transistor radios and televisions. By the end of the 1960s, there were over 1,000 broadcast stations in the United States. Today there are over 3,000 broadcast stations in the United States alone.  Broadcasting has become an important part of our society and culture. It is used to deliver news and information as well as entertainment content to millions of people around the world.

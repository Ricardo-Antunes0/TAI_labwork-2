The Eddington Bend Site, designated Site 74-8 by the Maine Archaeological Survey, is a prehistoric archaeological site in Eddington, Maine.  Located near the banks of the Penobscot River, the site includes both evidence of habitation, and of funerary remains.  The stratified site has dated elements as old as 3,000 BCE, and undated finds that are probably older.   The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description The Eddington Bend Site is located on a terrace overlooking the Penobscot River, not far from the former location of the Veazie Dam, at a point in which the river bends sharply to the west.  The river is described at this point as having a particularly fine and well-known salmon pool.  The site includes a bluff on the river bank that is subject to erosion, and is composed primarily of sandy soils topped by a plow zone.

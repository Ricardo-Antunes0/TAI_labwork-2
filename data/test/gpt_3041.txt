Kosala Proper or simply Kosala is the name given to an area of central India that was ruled by the Kosalas. The kingdom was founded by Hari (the son of the moon-god Shesha), and was located in the present-day state of Uttar Pradesh.  The kingdom rose to power in the 2nd century BCE, when it annexed parts of what is now Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. In the 1st century CE, it became a major power in northern India, and its ruler, king Bhimasena, was a powerful ally of the Roman Empire. However, Kosala's power was eventually eclipsed by that of neighbouring kingdoms, and it was destroyed by the Huns in the 4th century CE.  Kosala is most famous for its coins, which are some of the earliest examples of Indian currency.

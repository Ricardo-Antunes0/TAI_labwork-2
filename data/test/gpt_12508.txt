Aaron Monroe "Mac" McCreary (September 15, 1892 â€“ May 11, 1968) was an American writer of short stories, novels and poetry.  McCreary was born in Knoxville, Tennessee to a Methodist minister father and a mother who taught music. He attended Oberlin College and the University of Iowa before moving to New York City in 1917. There he worked as a journalist and wrote for the magazines "Judge" and "The Nation". He also wrote plays and screenplays, but his best known work is his short stories.  McCreary's short stories are often set in the American South during the Depression or during World War II. They are often darkly humorous, and often explore the ways that poverty, violence, and illness affect ordinary people. His best-known story is "The Bear," which was later made into a movie starring James Stewart.  McCreary died in 1968 at the age of 74.

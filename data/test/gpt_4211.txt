The 1972 Aldershot bombing was a car bomb attack on Aldershot Military Town, Hampshire, England which killed five people and injured 23. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in the United Kingdom until the 7 July 2005 London bombings.  The bomb was placed in a Renault 4 driven by Michael Hayes, a 19-year-old member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), who had parked near an Army recruitment office. The device exploded at 10:10am on 17 July 1972, killing Hayes and four passers-by and injuring 23 others. The attack was Britain's worst terrorist incident for nearly two decades.  The IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing, saying that it was revenge for British military action in Northern Ireland. The bombing made headlines around the world and increased public scrutiny of the IRA.

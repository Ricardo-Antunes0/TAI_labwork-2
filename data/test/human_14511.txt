Snuff is a smokeless tobacco made from finely ground or pulverized tobacco leaves. It is inhaled or "sniffed" (alternatively sometimes written as "snuffed") into the nasal cavity, delivering a swift hit of nicotine and a lasting flavored scent (especially if flavoring has been blended with the tobacco). Traditionally, it is sniffed or inhaled lightly after a pinch of snuff is either placed onto the back surface of the hand, held pinched between thumb and index finger, or held by a specially made "snuffing" device. Snuff originated in the Americas and was in common use in Europe by the 17th century. Traditional snuff production consists of a lengthy, multi-step process, in tobacco snuff mills. The selected tobacco leaves are first subject to special tobacco curing or fermentation processes, where they will later provide the individual characteristics and flavor for each type of snuff blend.  Snuff is usually scented or flavored, with many blends of snuff requiring months to years of special storage to reach the required maturity.  Typical traditional flavors are varieties of blended tobacco leaves considered original "fine snuff" without any addition of scents or essences.  Varieties of spice, piquant, fruit, floral, and mentholated (also called "medicated") soon followed, either pure or in blends.  Each snuff manufacturer usually has a variety of unique recipes and blends, as well as special recipes for individual customers. Common flavors also include coffee, chocolate, bordeaux, honey, vanilla, cherry, orange, apricot, plum, camphor, cinnamon, rose and spearmint.  Modern flavors include Bourbon, Cola and whisky. Traditional classic German snuff blends are the pungent and sharp Schmalzler and Brasil blends.

Dina Temple-Raston is a Belgian-born American journalist and award-winning author.  She is a member of NPR's Breaking News Investigations team and was previously the creator, host, and correspondent of NPR's "I'll Be Seeing You" radio specials on technologies that watch us. She also created, hosted and reported an Audible podcast called "What Were You Thinking," which Entertainment Weekly named as one of the best new podcasts of 2018 Feb 23 issue, saying it was "a provocative series which tells the stories of teenagers who've made the worst kinds of choices -- joining ISIS, planning a school shooting -- before analyzing the impulses behind them." In a review, The Washington Post wrote that it was "the podcast every parent needs to hear." Temple-Raston had previously served as NPR's counter-terrorism correspondent for more than a decade and she is the author of four award-winning books of narrative non-fiction including A Death in Texas: A Story of Race, Murder and a Small Town's Struggle for Redemption, about the James Byrd murder in Jasper, Texas; and "The Jihad Next Door: Rough Justice in the Age of Terror," which looks at being Muslim in America post 9-11.

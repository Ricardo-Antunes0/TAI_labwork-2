Fibre modification is a research field in the fiber optics and telecommunications industries that deals with the modification of optical fibres to improve their performance. This can be done by changing the chemical or physical properties of the fibre, or by adding new materials to the core of the fibre.  Fibre modification has a long history, dating back to the early days of optical communication when engineers began experimenting with ways to improve the performance of optical fibres. Today, fibre modification is used to improve the transmission capacity, bandwidth, and reliability of optical networks.  One of the most common methods used to modify optical fibres is called electro-optical modulation (EOM). EOM involves changing the light level within a fibre using an electric field. This allows different parts of the fibre to transmit light at different power levels, which can then be used to create digital signals.  Other methods used to modify optical fibres include acoustic wave propagation (AWP), which uses sound waves to modulate light; and Brillouin scattering (BS), which uses light waves to scatter off tiny particles in the air.  Fibre modification is a rapidly growing field, with researchers exploring new ways to improve the performance of optical fibres. As optical networks become more complex and reliant on high-quality transmission, fibre modification will play an important role in ensuring that they meet customer demands.

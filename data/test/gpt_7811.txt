Euryanthe (J. 291, Op. 81) is a neoclassical opera in three acts by the Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It is loosely based on the story of Orpheus and Eurydice.  Euryanthe premiered on 13 October 1789 at the Burgtheater in Vienna, Austria, and was well received by the public. The opera was not completed until 1791, after Mozart's death.  The work is scored for flute (2nd doubling piccolo), clarinet (2nd doubling contrabass clarinet), bassoon, horn, trumpet, timpani, strings and continuo.  Euryanthe tells the story of Orpheus, a musician famed for his skill with the lyre, and Eurydice, his beautiful wife. After she is kidnapped by Death, Orpheus travels to the underworld to bring her back. Along the way he is visited by various gods and goddesses who all try to help him win Eurydice back. In the end, Orpheus manages to free Eurydice from Death, but she dies in his arms.

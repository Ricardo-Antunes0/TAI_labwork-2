The ucode system (written in lower case) is a character encoding scheme for the Unicode Standard.  The ucode system was created by Michael Everson in 1997, as an alternative to the ISO-8859-1 scheme. It has been standardized as part of Unicode 7.0 in 2010.  The ucode system encodes all Unicode characters using a single byte, with codepoints starting at U+0000. Unlike the ISO-8859-1 scheme, which uses two bytes for each codepoint, the ucode system uses one byte for each codepoint. This allows for a larger set of characters to be encoded without needing to use multiple bytes per character.  A drawback of the ucode system is that it is not well suited for text encoding. Because it uses a single byte per character, it is less efficient than the ISO-8859-1 scheme when it comes to encoding text.

Lynmouth Foreland Lighthouse (also called the Countisbury Foreland Lighthouse, after the nearby village) is located on Foreland Point; it was originally simply named 'The Foreland Lighthouse'. First lit on 28 September 1900, the lighthouse was built to assist vessels passing through the Bristol Channel, and is a round brick tower painted white. The light is  above the high tide, and flashes 4 times every 15 seconds; the optic ('a 1st Order dioptric apparatus, eight panels in two groups of four, revolving on a motor driven mercury float pedestal') was manufactured by Chance Brothers & Co. and is very similar to that installed in Pendeen Lighthouse the same year. It was rotated by clockwork until 1975. Initially, the light was said to have the power of 56,750 candles; later (its oil lamp having been superseded by a more powerful paraffin vapour burner) the intensity of the light was rated at around 190,000 candlepower. In 1906, the lighthouse was provided with an explosive fog signal, which sounded once every five minutes and was actuated by an automatic clockwork firing mechanism. This was housed in a hut at the top of the steep steps leading down to the lighthouse, (the hut has since been demolished, along with the adjacent explosives magazine). The explosive signal remained in use until 1958 (a few years later the mechanism was offered 'on permanent loan to any British museum which may be interested'). In its place, a triple-frequency electric fog signal was installed, sounding through a stack of thirty Tannoy speakers built on to the front of the lighthouse tower; because the lighthouse was not yet connected to mains electricity the 3,000 rpm alternator (which simultaneously generated alternating current of the three different frequencies required) was driven by a diesel engine. The fog signal has since been decommissioned.

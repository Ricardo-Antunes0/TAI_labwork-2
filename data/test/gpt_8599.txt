The A4260 is a road that leads from the village of Slapton in North Devon to the village of Kingswear in South Devon. The road is approximately 25 miles long and passes through a number of villages and small towns.  The A4260 was originally constructed as a bypass route around the town of Slapton in North Devon. The road was first proposed in 1958 but it wasn't until 1972 that full construction began. The bypass was completed in 1976 and has since become a popular route for tourists and commuters.  The A4260 is currently maintained by North Devon County Council but it is expected that the road will eventually be replaced by a dual carriageway.

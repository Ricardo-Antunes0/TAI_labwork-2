The second season of Smallville, an American television series, premiered on October 12, 2006 and concluded on May 13, 2007. The season follows the story of Clark Kent (Tom Welling), who, after being exposed to a powerful meteor, discovers his superpowers and uses them to fight crime as the superhero known as Superman.   Season 2 saw the introduction of several new characters, including John Jones (Donal Logue), a former military man turned vigilante; Chloe Sullivan (Chloe Moretz), a high school student who becomes Clark's love interest; and Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg), an ambitious scientist who becomes Clark's archenemy. The season also saw the return of several characters from the first season, including Lex's father, Lionel Luthor (John Gallagher Jr.), and Lois Lane (Marguerite Vasquez).  The season was generally well-received by critics, with particular praise for the performances of Welling and Eisenberg. However, some fans criticized the addition of new characters and plotlines, and the season's ending was seen as ambiguous.

Forest Haven was a live-in facility for children and adults with intellectual disability (ID) located in Laurel, Maryland and operated by the District of Columbia. The site was opened in 1925 and closed on October 14, 1991, by order of a federal judge after years of alleged abuse, medical incompetence, and several deaths from aspiration pneumonia. Overview Forest Haven opened in 1925 as a farm-like institution geared towards educating its patients with useful life skills.  It encompassed nearly 300 acres and contained 22 separate buildings, and at its height housed well over one thousand patients.  Its decline began in the 1960s as funding was cut and the population grew to include persons with non-ID conditions such as epilepsy.  In 1974, Forest Haven received at least 20 individuals from a nearby orphanage "Junior Village" which had closed. A lawsuit filed by families of patients at Forest Haven in 1976 and joined by the Department of Justice in 1978 resulted in the relocation of many residents to group homes, but the facility continued to operate, even allowing a physician with a suspended medical license to continue practicing there.

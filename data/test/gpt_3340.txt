2MASS J12195156+3128497 (abbreviated to 2MASS J1219+3128) is an infrared galaxy located about 230 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. It is the most massive and brightest member of the Virgo Cluster.  2MASS J1219+3128 was first observed on October 21, 2002 by the 2MASS observatory in Massachusetts. The galaxy was found to be emitting more infrared light than any other galaxy of its size and luminosity. The main source of this infrared radiation is likely a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.  The galaxy is also known for its unusual morphology, which includes a central bulge and a very large bar-shaped structure. This bar-shaped structure could be caused by the gravitational pull of a central black hole, or by the merger of two galaxies.

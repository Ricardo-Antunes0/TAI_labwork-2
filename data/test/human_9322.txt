John William Hopkins (June 3, 1953 â€“ March 11, 2000), known as The Mohawk Valley Ripper, was an American serial killer and kidnapper who raped and killed at least three women in New York's Mohawk Valley region from 1972 to 1978. Convicted for two of these deaths during his lifetime, he was given two 25-year-to-life terms, which he served until his suicide in 2000. Early life John William Hopkins was born on June 3, 1953, in Johnstown, New York, the only son of a mechanic. Little is known about his childhood, but at some point during his adolescence, he expressed a desire to join the state police, but eventually gave up on the idea. According to friends and acquaintances of Hopkins, he enjoyed cruising along the New York State Thruway and stopping by college towns in his Chevy Nova, often wearing a cowboy hat and a military coat in an attempt to pass himself off as a trooper. Most concerningly, he appeared to have an unhealthy obsession with knives, often carrying several on his person in various knife sheaths.

Chen Tong  is a character featured in the novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. He is considered one of the most skilled and feared generals in all of China.  Chen Tong was born in present-day Shandong province around the year 190 CE. He was a descendant of the Chen clan, one of the most powerful and affluent families in pre-Qin China. Chen Tong's father, Chen Sheng, was a noted military strategist and governor.  Chen Tong first came to prominence during the civil war between the warlords Zhang Xian and Cao Cao. As an officer under Zhang Xian, he fought bravely against Cao Cao's forces at the Battle of Red Cliffs. After Zhang Xian's defeat, Chen Tong defected to Cao Cao's side and served under him as a general.  Chen Tong is perhaps best known for his role in the Battle of Mount Ding Jun, which ended with Cao Cao's victory over Liu Bei. Chen Tong's cavalry played a critical role in routing Liu Bei's forces and capturing their leader, Sun Quan.  After Cao Cao's death, Chen Tong fought against Sun Quan for control of the central government. He eventually emerged as one of Sun Quan's strongest supporters and served as his chief military advisor.  Chen Tong died in 259 CE, just two years after Sun Quan's victory over the Wei kingdom. He is buried in present-day Hangzhou city, Zhejiang province.

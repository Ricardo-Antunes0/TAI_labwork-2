Carla Aparecida Perez Soares da Silva (née Soares; born November 16, 1977) is a Brazilian singer, dancer, television presenter and former actress. She reached fame in the mid-1990s after performing as the blonde dancer with axé group É o Tchan! (loira do Tchan). Biography Carla Perez was born in Salvador, Bahia on November 16, 1977, to Carlos Soares and Ivone Perez; on her mother's side, she is of Spanish descent. She also has two brothers and two sisters. When she was 15 years old, she gave up on her baile de debutante to afford a model course. In 1995 she was invited to perform for newly founded axé group É o Tchan!, what launched her into nationwide fame and later on led her to pose naked five times for Playboy Brasil. Perez parted ways with É o Tchan! in 1998 to pursue personal projects, such as the one of being an actress; in the same year she starred alongside Alexandre Pires (her boyfriend at the time), Perry Salles, Lázaro Ramos and Lucci Ferreira in the semi-fictionalized biopic Cinderela Baiana, directed by Conrado Sanchez. It was a critical and commercial failure, and Perez announced many years after the film's release that she had disowned it. Her final acting role was a cameo in the 1999 film Xuxa Requebra. Around the same time she hosted the variety shows Fantasia (from 1998 to 1999) and Canta e Dança, Minha Gente (from 1999 to 2001), both broadcast by SBT.

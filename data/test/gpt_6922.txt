Monmouth Coffee Company is a coffee roaster, retailer and cafe located in Monmouth, Oregon. The company was founded in 2007 by Roanoke native Bryan Elliott and his wife, Kari. Monmouth Coffee is a direct-to-consumer roaster, meaning that it does not sell its coffee beans to large grocery stores or coffee chains.  Bryan Elliott grew up in Roanoke, Virginia, and graduated from the University of Virginia with a degree in business administration. He moved to Oregon in 2006 and started a small business marketing custom golf clubs. In 2007, he decided to start a coffee company. He found a location in Monmouth, Oregon, and began roasting beans himself.  In 2009, Elliott met Kari, a native of Monmouth, who was working as an accountant in Portland. The Elliots married that year and decided to move their company from Monmouth to Monmouth proper. In 2010, they opened the first Monmouth Coffee retail location on Main Street. They continue to operate both the Main Street location as well as a larger cafe on Highway 101 in Monmouth.  Monmouth Coffee has been recognized for its unique roasting methods and high-quality coffee beans. In 2013, Elliott was named one of the "20 Most Influential People in Oregon Coffee" by The Oregonian newspaper. He has also been featured on national television programs such as "Shark Tank" and "The Profit."

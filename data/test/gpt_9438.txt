Uranus, the seventh planet of the Solar System, is the largest and most distant of the gas giants. It has 29 known moons, all of which were discovered by Voyager 1 and 2 in 1986 and 1987, respectively.  Most of Uranus's moons are small, with only two exceeding 100 km in diameter: Miranda (182 km) and Ariel (188 km). The largest moon, Titania (1,091 km), is about three-fourths the size of Earth's moon. The other 29 moons range in size from 20 to 230 km across.  The first 13 moons were discovered by Voyager 1 and 2 when they flew by Uranus in 1986 and 1987. These satellites were initially given provisional designations based on their appearances from Earth: Liberty (a small moon near the north pole), 1851 Flamingo (a small moon near the equator), Hero (a small moon near the south pole), Adonis (a small moon near the middle of the solar system), and Aten (the smallest moon, discovered later by Hubble Space Telescope).  Since then, five more moons have been discovered: Asimov (1995), Brahmas (1997), Chaucer (1998), Nereid (2000), and Oberon (2002). The sixth satellite, Titania, was discovered by Hubble in 1998; it was later renamed after the goddess Titania from Shakespeare's play A Midsummer Night's Dream. The seventh planet, Neptune, has 14 known satellites.

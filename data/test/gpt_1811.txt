The Western Roman Empire comprises the western half of the Roman Empire, from the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD to its ultimate fall in 498 AD. The Eastern Roman Empire continued until 1453 AD, when it fell to the Ottoman Turks.  The Western Roman Empire was established after the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire in 395 AD. At its height, it covered most of Europe, North Africa and much of the Mediterranean basin. The Western Roman Empire was ruled by an autocrat, or emperor, who held absolute power over the empire's military, civil and religious affairs. The empire declined in the 5th century, although it would not formally fall until 476 AD. The Western Roman Empire was followed by the Byzantine Empire, which lasted until 1453 AD.

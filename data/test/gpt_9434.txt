Fishtail Mesa is a linear, narrow plateau, approximately long and wide, located in the eastern Mojave Desert of California. The mesa is flanked by the Black Mountains to the east and the Amboy Hills to the west. The plateau is bounded on the north by the Amboy Valley and on the south by the Antelope Valley.  The mesa is composed of sedimentary and igneous rocks dating from the Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Paleogene periods. The sedimentary rocks are made up of sandstone, shale, and limestone. The igneous rocks are composed of pyroxene, feldspar, and granite.  The plateau was formed about 100 million years ago when a large chunk of the San Andreas Fault broke off and moved northwestward. Over time, erosion removed most of the sedimentary rock from the mesa, leaving only the igneous rock.

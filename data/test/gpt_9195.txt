The Little Long March was a , one-year long campaign by the Chinese Communist Party to reach the northwest frontier of China before the winter season.  The campaign, which began in November 1934, was a difficult one, with the Communists marching over treacherous terrain and often encountering resistance from the Kuomintang forces. By the time they reached their destination in May 1935, only a fraction of the original force had survived. However, their victory demonstrated the Party's ability to mobilise and lead large numbers of people in a remote and inhospitable region.

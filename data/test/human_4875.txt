Joanne Giannini (born March 15, 1953) is an American politician who was a  Democratic member of the Rhode Island House of Representatives, representing District 7 (Providence) from 1994 till 2010. On July 2, 2010, she announced she would not run for reelection. Legislation Beginning in 2005, Joanne Giannini became the leading proponent to change the prostitution law in Rhode Island, every year submitting bills to close what she termed the legal "loophole" that allowed indoor prostitution. "Rape behind closed doors, is that permissible? Is murder permissible if it's done behind closed doors?", she asked. Critics of her bills have argued that "In Joanne Giannini's world, prostitution and human trafficking are synonymous, and every prostitute is a victim, not an individual making a personal choice." Giannini addressed the issue in her appearance in the 2009 documentary Happy Endings?, concerning the lives of the women in the Asian massage parlors in the center of the debate to re-criminalize prostitution. Giannini's bill was signed into law in November 2009.

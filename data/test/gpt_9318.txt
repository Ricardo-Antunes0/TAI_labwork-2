Canadian war memorials are buildings, monuments, and other physical reminders of Canada's military history. The earliest memorials were erected in the late 19th century, shortly after Canadas involvement in the First and Second World Wars. Since the 1960s, memorials have been erected throughout Canada to honour the countrys military personnel who have died in conflict or service.  The majority of Canadian war memorials are located in provincial or territorial capitals or other large cities. There are also a significant number of memorials located in rural communities. Some memorials, such as the Vimy Memorial in France, commemorate a single event or battle, while others, such as the National War Memorial in Ottawa, commemorate the entire course of Canada's military history.   Canadian war memorials are often designed by prominent Canadian architects and sculptors. Some of the most famous Canadian war memorials include the Vimy Memorial in France, the National War Memorial in Ottawa, and the cenotaph at Halifax Harbour.

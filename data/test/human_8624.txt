Marley Station Mall is an enclosed shopping mall in Glen Burnie, Maryland. Opened in 1987, it was expanded in 1994 and 1996. The mall has 130 stores on 2 floors, a movie theater, and 5 anchor spaces. JCPenney, Macy's, and Golds Gym serve as the mall's current anchor tenants. The other two anchor spaces were occupied by Boscov's until 2008, and Sears until 2021. History Taubman Centers completed Marley Station in 1987. At the time, it included two anchor stores: Hecht's and Macy's. During construction in 1985 a body was discovered in a trash can on the site, which was not identified as Roger Kelso until 2019. Taubman expanded the mall in 1994 with a third anchor, JCPenney, which was the most-requested store among mall patrons at the time. Sears was added in 1996 as a fourth anchor. This store replaced an existing Sears in Glen Burnie which was built in the 1960s.

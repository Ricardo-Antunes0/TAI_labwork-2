A kippah (; , plural  ), also called a koppel , or yarmulke , is a brimless cap, usually made of cloth, traditionally worn by Jewish males to fulfill the customary requirement that the head be covered. It is worn by men in Orthodox communities at all times. Among non-Orthodox communities, those who wear them customarily do so only during prayer, while attending a synagogue, or in other rituals. Most synagogues and Jewish funeral parlors keep a ready supply of kippot. Etymology  The term kippah  literally means "dome", as the kippah is worn on the head like a dome.  The Yiddish term yarmulke is often associated with an Aramaic phrase (ירא מלכא) 'yireh malkha' meaning "fear of the King". It might be derived from Polish jarmułka or Ukrainian yarmulka, perhaps ultimately from Medieval Latin almutia "cowl, hood" or of Turkic origin (akin to yağmurluk, meaning "rainwear"), Keppel or koppel is another Yiddish term for the same thing.

Su Zhenhua (; June 2, 1912 â€“ May 26, 1978) was a Chinese writer and intellectual who helped to shape the development of modern Chinese literature. A leading spokesman for the New Culture Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, he is considered one of the most prominent representatives of the Post-Mao Zedong era.  Born in 1912 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Su Zhenhua was one of the most prominent students of Yan Fu, a leading figure in Chinese poetry and literature during the late Qing Dynasty. After graduating from Peking University in 1934 with a degree in literature, Su began to publish articles and books advocating for a reformed literary tradition that would be more in tune with modern life. He also became involved in leftist politics, serving as an editor for several leftist publications during the 1940s.  Su's career took a turn when he was arrested during the Communist Revolution of 1949 and spent several years in prison. After his release, he resumed his writing career but soon became disillusioned with the new regime and withdrew from public life. He died in 1978.

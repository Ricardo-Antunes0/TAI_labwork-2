May Gowen Watkis (née Hilda May Gowen; 22 August 1879 – 6 December 1940) served as a projectionist, clerk, and tax inspector at various agencies of the British Columbia government during the years 1913-40. In 1920-21, she was briefly employed as a clerk in the Vancouver office of the British Columbia Patriotic and Educational Picture Service (PEPS), under the service's director, Dr. Albert Richard Baker. In May 1921, she was the subject of an article written by Edith Cuppage for Maclean's Magazine. Cuppage descibed Watkis as the head or "directress" of the Picture Service. This erroneous information about May Watkis has been repeated in a number of books and articles on Canadian film history, which describe her as the director or "directress" of the Patriotic and Educational Picture Service. Career  British Columbia was the first province to establish a film censorship office, bringing with it career opportunities. Watkis was determined to become join the film industry, but did not believe she would make it as an actress. In 1913, Watkis applied to become a film censor, however, the attorney-general of the time rejected her application and gave the position to a man. Undeterred, Watkis offered her services to the new censor as his assistant, and he hired her as his projectionist. Although Watkis knew nothing about projecting films, she agreed.

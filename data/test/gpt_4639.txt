A  Jacobin  was a member of the French National Convention during the French Revolution.   The Jacobin Club was a political club in Paris during the French Revolution, founded by Maximilien Robespierre on 22 May 1793. It was initially dominated by members of the sans-culottes (the lower classes of society who had made up the bulk of the protesters during the French Revolution), but it soon became a forum for representatives of all factions in France. The Jacobin Club played an important role in the development of the French Revolutionary state and it remains a powerful political force in France to this day.

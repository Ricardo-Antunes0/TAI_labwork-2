Extreme Characters (also known as brink users and extreme users) is a methodology used within user-centered design in order to represent edge case users of a product, brand or user interface. Extreme Characters also fits under the umbrella of market segmentation within marketing as it formulates design solutions for both average users and extreme, brink users. The concept of creating extreme users has been adopted heavily into the concept user-centered design and human-centered computing, and has led to its wide adoption both within online and offline applications, along with its placement within marketing communications.   Extreme characters is based within designing for the brink users for a product, this behaviour is cultivated through the collection of data through focus groups and interviews with specific users. From this, a clear goal, or user need, is formulated.  By designing for a user need that is only reflected by a minority of the focus group, the use-case of extreme users is born. Through designing for this minority, design solutions stem for both use brink users, and the average user.

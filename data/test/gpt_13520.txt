Janice Lynn "Jan" Kuehnemund (; November 18, 1951 â€“ November 10, 2018) was an American computer scientist and academic who specialized in the theory of distributed systems. She held the positions of Distinguished Professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Vice Chancellor for Research at the University of California, Berkeley.  Born in 1951, Jan Kuehnemund obtained her bachelor's degree from Oberlin College in 1972 and her PhD from UC Berkeley in 1976. From 1976 to 1978 she was a research scientist at Xerox PARC. From 1978 to 1992 she was a professor at UC Berkeley, where she also served as Vice Chancellor for Research from 1992 to 1998. In 1998 she moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where she continued to hold the position of Distinguished Professor until her death in 2018.  Kuehnemund's research focused on the theory of distributed systems, with a particular emphasis on large-scale collaboration and data sharing. She is credited with coining the term "distributed systems" and developing early models of how they work. In particular, Kuehnemund is known for her work on the CAP theorem, which states that any system that relies on communication between several nodes is subject to the CAP problem: even if all nodes are honest, it is impossible to ensure that messages will reach their destination without being tampered with en route. Her work has had a significant impact on the development of networked computing systems, and she has been frequently cited

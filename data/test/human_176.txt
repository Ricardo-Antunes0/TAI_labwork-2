Zadvor  is a formerly independent settlement in the southeast part of the capital Ljubljana in central Slovenia. It belongs to the City Municipality of Ljubljana. It is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included with the rest of the municipality in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region. In addition to the main settlement, Zadvor consists of the hamlets of Križavka (also known as Križanke) to the southeast, near Saint Leonard's Church in Sostro, Žabja Vas  to the south below Zadvor Hill , and Cegelnica next to that. In Žabja Vas there are two ponds in pits that were dug for the former brickworks at Cegelnica. Name The name Zadvor is a fused prepositional phrase that has lost its case inflection, from za 'behind' + dvor 'manor'. The name thus literally means 'behind the manor'. The word dvor is a relatively common toponym element in Slovenia and, in addition to 'manor', may also refer to a farm with outbuildings, an estate, a (fenced-in) courtyard, or a barnyard, as well as a medieval agricultural estate comprising up to 40 farms. In this case, the name refers to a property owned by lesser nobility in the 11th and 12th centuries. The estate was later divided among the family members, who pursued farming. The settlement was known as Saduor in German.

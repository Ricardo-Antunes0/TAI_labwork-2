A kippah (; , plural  ), also spelled kippah, is a type of skullcap or yarmulke worn by some Jewish men and women in traditional Judaism. Kippahs come in a variety of styles and colors, but are usually made from a cloth bag with a rounded top, a band around the forehead, and a strap that goes over the back of the head.

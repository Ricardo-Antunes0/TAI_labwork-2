"Bait a Hook" is a song co-written by country music artist Willie Nelson and Canadian musician Ray Price. The song was released in October 1970 as the second single from Nelson's album Shotgun Willie.  The song was written while Nelson and Price were awaiting sentencing for charges of marijuana possession. Nelson explained the song's genesis in a 1998 interview with NPR: "I was sitting on the side of the road with my friend Ray Price, and we were waiting for our trials to come up, and we just started talking about life, you know. We were just talking about women and all that kind of stuff. And then we started talking about fishing, and how much fun it is to catch a fish with a hook."  "Bait a Hook" reached number two on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles chart in 1970. The song also reached number one on the "RPM" Country Tracks chart in Canada.

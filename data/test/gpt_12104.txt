The Book of Baruch is a deuterocanonical book of the Bible, traditionally placed after the book of Jeremiah and before the book of Lamentations.  The Book of Baruch is a midrashic work, or collection of teachings, attributed to the biblical prophet Baruch. It is thought to have been written in the 4th century BC, during or after the Babylonian exile.  The book contains a series of speeches and visions attributed to Baruch, primarily concerning the fate of Jerusalem and the Jewish people. It also contains prophecies relating to the Second Temple, including a description of its destruction. The book has been seen as an important source of Jewish mysticism and Kabbalah.

He previously served as Minister without portfolio for Reforms and Devolution in the Berlusconi II Cabinet (since 20 June 2004) and in the Berlusconi III Cabinet (until 18 February 2006, when he resigned following the so-called "cartoon crisis"). Roberto Calderoli is a leading member of Lega Nord. He is regarded as representing the right wing of the political spectrum and Bergamo, whereas Roberto Maroni represents the area originating from the left wing and Varese. Calderoli is often the centre of public controversies, usually because of racist, xenophobic or offensive public remarks. Responding to criticism about a controversial electoral law that he penned in 2006, Calderoli affirmed that "I wrote [the law], but honestly it is a pig-sty (in Italian Porcata)." In July 2013, Calderoli insulted Italy's first black Minister, Italo-Congolese CÃ©cile Kyenge, saying: "Whenever I see Minister Kyenge, I cannot help but think of an orangutan".

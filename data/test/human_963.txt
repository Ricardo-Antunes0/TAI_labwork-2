Francesco Tortoli (or Tortolj) (1790 – 20 May 1824) was an Italian scenographer, active in Naples from 1808 at the city's principal theatres—Teatro San Carlo, Teatro del Fondo and Teatro dei Fiorentini. He was the creator of sets for numerous productions including those for the world premieres of Rossini's La gazzetta, Otello, Armida, Mosè in Egitto, and La donna del lago. Tortoli was born in Florence and died in Naples of cholera at the age of 35. Life and career Born in Florence in 1790, Tortoli was the nephew and student of Antonio Niccolini, a Tuscan architect who later had a substantial career in Naples. Niccolini rebuilt the interior of the Teatro San Carlo after it burned down in 1816 and was also the theatre's chief scenographer. Tortoli was active as a scenery painter under the direction of Niccolini by 1808 when he worked on the sets for the first performance of Antonio Sacchini's Edipo a Colono at the Teatro San Carlo.

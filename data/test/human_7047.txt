Uyaquq (also Uyaquk or Uyakoq; sometimes referred to in English as Helper Neck) (ca. 1860â€“1924) was a member of the Yup'ik people who became a Helper in the Moravian Church, noted for his linguistic abilities. He went from being an illiterate adult to inventing a series of writing systems for his native language and then producing translations of the Bible and other religious works in a period of five years. Uyaquq was born into a family of shamans in the lower Kuskokwim River valley of central Alaska in the mid-1860s. Even by the standards of the day, Uyaquk was a small man.  He became a shaman in early adulthood, but converted to Christianity after his father converted.  Although his father became a Russian Orthodox, Uyaquk became a leader and missionary in the Alaskan Moravian Church.  His name means "Neck" in English and he was called that by some English speakers.

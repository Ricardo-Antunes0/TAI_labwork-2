PC/104 (or PC104) is a family of embedded computer standards which define both form factors and computer buses by the PC/104 Consortium. Its name derives from the 104 pins on the interboard connector (ISA) in the original PC/104 specification and has been retained in subsequent revisions, despite changes to connectors. PC/104 is intended for specialized environments where a small, rugged computer system is required.  The standard is modular, and allows consumers to stack together boards from a variety of COTS manufacturers to produce a customized embedded system. The original PC/104 form factor is somewhat smaller than a desktop PC motherboard at .  Unlike other popular computer form factors such as ATX, which rely on a motherboard or backplane, PC/104 boards are stacked on top of each other like building blocks.  The PC/104 specification defines four mounting holes at the corners of each module, which allow the boards to be fastened to each other using standoffs.  The stackable bus connectors and use of standoffs provides a more rugged mounting than slot boards found in desktop PCs.  The compact board size further contributes to the ruggedness of the form factor by reducing the possibility of PCB flexing under shock and vibration.

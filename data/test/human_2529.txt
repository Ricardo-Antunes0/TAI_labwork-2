The exclamation "O'zapft is!" (Bavarian for "It is tapped", standard German: "Es ist angezapft") is a tradition during the tapping of the first beer barrel by the mayor of Munich in the Schottenhamel tent at the opening of the Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany since 1950. The exclamation is followed by a signal of twelve gunshots, signalling that beer may now be sold in all of the tents. The opening ceremony takes place every year at noon on the first Saturday after 15 September. The traditional exclamation "O'zapft is!" is always followed by the wish "Auf eine friedliche Wiesn" ("for a peaceful Oktoberfest"). History After the Mayor of Munich Thomas Wimmer had opened the "Münchener Elektro-Messe 1950"<ref>BGBl 1950, p. 370.</ref> in the Theresienhöhe district, he made his way to the Schottenhamel tent on the Theresienwiese meadow. Reporters and photographers had been waiting for him and so he performed the first official opening of Oktoberfest. He dedicated the first Maß of beer to Oktoberfest and to the city of Munich, in 1980 the minister-president of Bavaria and the candidate for Chancellor of Germany Franz Josef Strauß started a tradition that the first Maß of beer goes to the current minister-president, continuing to this day. The legend that the first opening of Oktoberfest in 1950 was spontaneous after Wimmer had missed his carriage and had to be taken to the fest grounds by the innkeeper Michael SchottenhamelOzapft is – mit 19 Schlägen, abendzeitung-muenchen.de 9 September 2008.

In 1960 the newly elected mayor Hans-Jochen Vogel deferred the honour of opening the first barrel to his predecessor Wimmer. Vogel only took on the ceremony in 1964 after Wimmer's death, and at that time a rule was made that it is the duty of the mayor of Munich to open the Oktoberfest ceremony.

was the name of a group of coastal fortifications built to guard the Hōyo Strait at the entrance to Bungo Channel between the Japanese islands of Kyushu and Shikoku and this the western entrance to the Seto Inland Sea. These gun batteries and fortifications ceased to be used after the end of World War II. History After the Meiji restoration, the primary threats to the new Empire of Japan were perceived to be Qing China's Beiyang fleet, followed by the Russian Empire's Pacific Fleet. The Meiji government ordered the construction of a set of coastal fortifications to protect the strategic waterway and approaches to major coastal cities. Initially, the Hiroshima Port Fortress was constructed to protect the city of Hiroshima, which was the location of the Imperial General Headquarters in the First Sino-Japanese War and the Geiyō Fortress was constructed to control the Kurushima Strait, a narrows in the Seto Inland Sea between Hiroshima and Shikoku, which blocked the western approaches to Kobe and Osaka.

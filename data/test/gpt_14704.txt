Ottomar Ernst Felix Rosenbach (4 January 1851 – 2 November 1916) was a German composer, pianist and conductor. He is best known for his opera Der Rosenkavalier, which he wrote with Richard Strauss.  Rosenbach was born in Frankfurt am Main, the son of the composer Ernst Ludwig Rosenbach and his wife Clara Antoinette (née Pestalozzi). From 1856 to 1862 he studied at the Leipzig Conservatory with Friedrich Wieck, and then with renowned pianist Franz Liszt in Weimar. He made his debut as a conductor in 1875 at Bremen, where he also served as director of the music school until 1893. He became director of the Berlin Akademie der Künste in 1895, and retired in 1911.  Rosenbach composed much chamber music, orchestral works, opera and religious music. His best-known works are his operas Der Rosenkavalier (1886), Die Frau ohne Schatten (1889), and Fidelio (1911), all of which were collaborations with Richard Strauss. In addition to Der Rosenkavalier, other important works include the symphonic poem Midsummer Night's Dream (1896), the Violin Concerto (1902), the cantata "Die Erleuchtete" (1905), and the oratorio "Die Himmelfahrt" (1911).

Inez García (1941–2003) was a Hispanic woman who became a cause célèbre of the feminist movement when she was charged with the 1974 murder of a man who had raped her. Background  García was born in New York City and raised in Spanish Harlem. Her ethnic heritage is mixed Puerto Rican and Cuban. She married the Cuban exile and Anti-Castro activist Juan García Cardenas, and the two of them had a son in 1963. Cardenas was imprisoned in Soledad, California, after being convicted of involvement in a political bombing in Los Angeles claimed by Poder Cubano. In 1971 Garcia moved to Soledad to be nearer to her husband. She worked in the lettuce fields and supplemented her income with welfare. She earned a reputation in the small, mostly Chicano community as a devout and chaste Catholic. She shared an apartment with Fred Medrano, a Texan who was involved in the illegal drug trade.

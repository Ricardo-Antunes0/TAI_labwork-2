"Canton" is an instrumental song by English rock band Radiohead. It was released as the fifth and final single from their seventh studio album "A Moon Shaped Pool" on 28 July 2017.  The song was written by frontman Thom Yorke and producer Nigel Godrich, and was recorded at Godrich's studio in Paris during the band's 2017 tour. The song's lyrics are about the city of Canton, Massachusetts.  "Canton" is a slow-paced ballad with a delicate sound, inspired by old-fashioned jazz and soul music. According to Godrich, the song is about "the beauty of decay". Yorke has said that it is about "the way certain things can be forgotten, or hidden away".  The song was well-received by critics. Pitchfork described it as "a beautiful and delicate ballad", while Rolling Stone called it "a moving ode to a place that was almost lost". The song debuted at number 67 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, and reached number 12 in its third week. It also reached number one on the Adult Alternative Songs chart and number three on the UK Singles Chart.

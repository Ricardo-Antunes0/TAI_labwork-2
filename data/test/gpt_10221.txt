Silver overlay is an electroplated coating of silver on a surface. It is a popular finish for jewelry, paper products, and other products.  The silver overlay process begins with an electroless plating of silver onto the desired substrate. The coating can be done in a variety of mediums, including but not limited to sterling silver, gold, brass, and copper. After the coating is complete, the substrate is then dried and polished to achieve the desired finish.

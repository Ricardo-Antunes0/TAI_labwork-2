My Dream Boat (foaled 17 April 2012) is a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. As a two-year-old he won two of his five races including the Group One May Hill Stakes. In the following year he finished third in the Derby and second in the St Leger. He has since been retired to stud.  My Dream Boat is a chestnut horse with a white blaze and a white sock on his right hind foot bred by his owner, Sheikh Mohammed. He was sent into training with John Gosden at his Warren Place stable.  He was sired by Sadler's Wells, who won the Derby and other major races in Europe including the 2000 Guineas and the St Leger. My Dream Boat's dam, Pussy Galore, was a successful racemare who also produced stakes-winners Halo and Sandown Park.

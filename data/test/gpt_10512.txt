The GEOSAT (GEOdetic SATellite) was a U.S. military weather satellite which operated from 1984 to 2005. It was the first operational geosynchronous satellite.  The GEOSAT instrument was designed to provide meteorological data for military and civilian users worldwide. The spacecraft operated in a geostationary orbit over the equator, providing continuous coverage of the Earth's surface for more than 20 years. Data from GEOSAT were used by civilian and military organizations to improve weather forecasting, monitor environmental conditions, and support navigation and land management.  In October 2005, GEOSAT was decommissioned after more than 20 years of service.

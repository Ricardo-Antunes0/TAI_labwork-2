The Parochialkirche (literally the Reformed parochial church) is a Protestant church in the centre of Dresden, Germany. It is the oldest existing Protestant church building in the city and the largest one still in use. It is also one of the most important cultural monuments of Dresden.  The Parochialkirche was built between 1741 and 1748 as part of an expansion of the city's Protestant population. The church was designed by Christian Jestorf and its construction was financed by the Saxon Elector Frederick II. The church's original name, "Kirche am Kr√∂nungsplatz", referred to its location on the site of an earlier Catholic chapel. The church served both Protestant and Catholic parishioners until the end of World War II, when it was forced to close down because of the bombing. It reopened in 1990 and now houses a museum dedicated to Dresden's Protestant history.

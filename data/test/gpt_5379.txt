Brian Shaw (28 June 1928 â€“ 2 October 2004) was an English-born Australian dancer and choreographer. He is best known for creating the character of "The Muppet Show's" Gonzo the Muppet.  Brian Shaw was born on 28 June 1928 in London, England. He studied at the Royal Ballet School, where he met his future collaborator, Jim Henson. In 1949, Shaw and Henson founded The Muppets Studio, which created such characters as Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, and Gonzo the Muppet.  Shaw's work on "The Muppet Show" helped to popularize the puppeteering technique of mime, which was previously used mainly by theater companies. He also choreographed several films for The Muppets, including "The Great Muppet Caper" (1981), "The Muppet Movie" (1982), and "Muppet Treasure Island" (1996).  Shaw retired from The Muppets Studio in 1989, but continued to work as a choreographer and performer until his death in 2004. He was posthumously awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

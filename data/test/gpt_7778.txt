In astrobiology and planetary astrophysics, the galactic habitable zone (GHZ) is the range of distances from a star within which a planetary surface could sustain life as we know it. The zone is determined by a number of factors, including the star's spectral type, mass, and temperature.  The GHZ around red dwarfs is typically significantly larger than that around stars like the Sun. This is because red dwarfs are much less active and thus their habitable zone is located closer to the star. The GHZ around M-dwarfs is also larger than that around Sun-like stars, due to their lower temperatures.  A terrestrial planet located within the GHZ would experience a much more temperate climate than one located outside of it. However, since the GHZ extends beyond the orbit of most planets in our Solar System, any such planet would be likely be subject to significant interstellar contact.

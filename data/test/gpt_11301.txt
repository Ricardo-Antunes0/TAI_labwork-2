Chaerephon (known as Chaerephon bats or lesser short-eared bats) are small mammals in the family Vespertilionidae. They are found in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.  Chaerephon bats have a head and body length of 37-53 cm, a wingspan of 100-130 cm, and a weight of 2-4 g. They have short ears and a short tail. They are brown or black in color, with a white belly.  The Chaerephon bat is a migratory insectivorous bat that spends the majority of its life in the air. It has large eyes and ears that allow it to see in all directions and hear well at night. It uses these abilities to find prey, which includes insects, other small bats, and birds.

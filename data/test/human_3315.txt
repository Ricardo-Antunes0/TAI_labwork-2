Rosh HaShanah (, , lit. "start of the year"), is the Jewish New Year. The biblical name for this holiday is Yom Teruah , literally "day of shouting or blasting." It is the first of the Jewish High Holy Days (, ; "Days of Awe"), as specified by Leviticus 23:23â€“25, that occur in the late summer/early autumn of the Northern Hemisphere. The High Holy Days comprises both Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur. Rosh Hashanah is a two-day observance and celebration that begins on the first day of Tishrei, which is the seventh month of the ecclesiastical year. In contrast to the ecclesiastical lunar new year on the first day of the first month Nisan, the spring Passover month which marks Israel's exodus from Egypt, Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the civil year, according to the teachings of Judaism, and is the traditional anniversary of the creation of Adam and Eve, the first man and woman according to the Hebrew Bible, as well as the initiation of humanity's role in God's world.

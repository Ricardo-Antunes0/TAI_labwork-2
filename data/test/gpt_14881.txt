A kinglet or crest is a small bird of the family Tyrannidae. They are typically very small, with short bills and stubby legs. They inhabit open habitats, such as grasslands and shrublands, and are often seen in flocks.  Kinglets are one of the most common bird families in the world, with around 150 species in 15 genera. They vary in size from the pygmy kinglet, at just 9 mm, to the great horned owl, at 1.5 m long. The majority of kinglets are small, with a length of 25–35 cm and a weight of 10–20 g. They have short, thick bills and strong legs. They are typically grey or brown in colour, with a white or buff crown or band on their head. They have long tails which they use to balance as they walk.   The kinglet family is found across much of the Northern Hemisphere, from North America to Europe and Asia. They are mainly found in open habitats, such as grasslands and shrublands, but some species can be found in forests. Kinglets are usually active during the morning and evening, but some species can be active at any time of day.   Kinglets feed on insects, which they catch by catching them in their bill or by perching on a twig and pecking at insects that come near. Kinglets are usually solitary birds, but some species form flocks during migration. Kinglets breed mainly during the winter months

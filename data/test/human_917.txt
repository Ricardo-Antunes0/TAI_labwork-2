Chijavadze  or Chizhavadze (ჩიჟავაძე) were a Georgian noble family (tavadi), prominent in the western kingdom of Imereti in the 16th and 17th centuries.  The Chijavadze of Imereti share origin with the Chichua, a noble family in neighboring Mingrelia. Their ancestors had settled in Kartli in the 10th century and then in Imereti in the mid-15th. The 20th-century historian Cyril Toumanoff considered them an offshoot of the medieval Kakhaberidze family of the Liparitid stock, while Simon Janashia and, following him, several other Georgian authorities, viewed them as the continuation of the noble clan (aznauri) Sadzvereli (საზვერელი) known from the medieval Georgian chronicles to have helped George II of Abkhazia to seize his rebellious son, Constantine, in the 920s. Janashia corroborated his conclusion by the fact that “Sadzvereli”, probably originally a territorial epithet, later appeared as a male given name in the Chijavadze family on several occasions. The surname Chijavadze itself is first recorded in the 15th-century documents.

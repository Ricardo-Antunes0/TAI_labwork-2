Fabrizio Carbone (born  in Novi Ligure, Italy) is a Swiss and Italian physicist and currently an Associate Professor at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). His research focuses on the study of matter in out of equilibrium conditions using ultrafast spectroscopy, diffraction and imaging techniques. In 2015, he attracted international attention by publishing a photography of light displaying both its quantum and classical nature. Education and career  Fabrizio Carbone received his master's degree in quantum electronics from the University of Pavia in 2001, defending a thesis titled 'Characterization of all optical wavelengths converters for telecommunications applications'. He was an industrial researcher at Pirelli Labs between 2000 and 2002, after which he returned to academia and obtained his PhD in condensed matter physics from the University of Geneva in 2007 defending a thesis titled 'Spectroscopic signatures of electronic correlations in superconductors and magnets' under the supervision of Dirk van der Marel. Carbone carried out his postdoctoral appointment at the California Institute of Technology in the group of Chemistry Nobel Prize laureate Ahmed Zewail. In 2010, he established the Laboratory for Ultrafast Microscopy and Electron Scattering (LUMES) at EPFL, where he was named Tenure Track Assistant Professor in 2011 and promoted to Associate Professor in 2018.

The Pashtun diaspora refers to ethnic Pashtuns who live outside of their traditional homeland of Pashtunistan, a historic region situated south of the Amu River in Afghanistan and west of the Indus River in Pakistan. While the Pashtunistan region is home to the majority of Pashtun people, there are significant Pashtun diaspora communities scattered across the neighbouring Pakistani provinces of Sindh and Punjab, particularly in their respective provincial capital cities of Karachi and Lahore. Additionally, Pashtuns are also found across India, particularly in the Rohilkhand region of the state of Uttar Pradesh, and in the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Outside of South Asia, significant diaspora Pashtun communities can be found in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf (primarily in the United Arab Emirates), the United States, Iran, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Russia and Australia. The Pashtun people, who are classified as an Iranian ethnolinguistic group, are believed to have settled in the traditional Pashtunistan region during the early . According to Ethnologue, they currently number around 50 million, but some sources give slightly lower or higher figures. Following the arrival of Islam in the region, many Pashtuns migrated and settled in the lands of the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughal Empire and other Islamic polities that were established during the Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent. Consequently, their descendants assimilated and intermixed with the Hindi- and Urdu-speaking locals; Pashtuns are commonly referred to as Pathan or Pathans within India and Pakistan.

Henley-on-Thames  is a town and civil parish on the River Thames in Oxfordshire, England,  northeast of Reading,  west of Maidenhead,  southeast of Oxford and  west of London (by road), near the tripoint of Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire. The population at the 2011 Census was 11,619. History Henley does not appear in Domesday Book of 1086; often it is mistaken for Henlei in the book which is in Surrey. There is archaeological evidence of people residing in Henley since the 2nd Century as part of the Romano-British period. The first record of Henley as a substantial settlement is from 1179, when it is recorded that King Henry II "had bought land for the making of buildings". King John granted the manor of Benson and the town and manor of Henley to Robert Harcourt in 1199. A church at Henley is first mentioned in 1204. In 1205 the town received a tax for street paving, and in 1234 the bridge is first mentioned. In 1278 Henley is described as a hamlet of Benson with a chapel. The street plan was probably established by the end of the 13th century.  As a demesne of the crown it was granted in 1337 to John de Molyns, whose family held it for about 250 years.

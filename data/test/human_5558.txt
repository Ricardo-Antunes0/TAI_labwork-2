The Chínipas is river of northwestern Mexico. The Chinipas arises deep in the Sierra Madre Occidental in the state of Chihuahua, and then flows through long rugged canyon systems into the state of Sinaloa until it finally joins the main trunk of the Fuerte River in the western foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental. The Fuerte River then flows westward over the western coastal plain of Sonora to the Pacific Ocean, emerging very near the port of Topolobampo. Geography The Chínipas River is the northwest most of the six rivers that make the six distinct extensive canyons in the Sierra Madre Occidental that are collectively referred to as the Copper Canyon area. All six rivers flow into the Fuerte River. Each of the six large rivers that flow into the Fuerte River have deep rugged canyons, and these canyons have many ravines and tributaries. Topographically the Copper Canyon region is a very rugged and remote area with few towns and few roads.

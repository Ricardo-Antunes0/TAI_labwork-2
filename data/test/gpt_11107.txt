Typhoon Vongfong, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Mangkhut, was a powerful and devastating typhoon that made landfall in the Philippines on September 15, 2020. The system formed from a tropical depression on September 12 and rapidly intensified as it tracked west-northwestward. On September 15, the system became a typhoon as it made landfall in the Philippines. The storm then rapidly shifted course to the north-northwest and reached its peak intensity with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h) just before making landfall in Vietnam on September 16. After making landfall, Vongfong quickly weakened and dissipated over land on September 17.  Typhoon Vongfong was one of the deadliest typhoons to make landfall in the Philippines in recent memory. The storm killed at least six people and caused extensive damage across the country. Strong winds and flooding were also major concerns for residents in Vietnam as Vongfong made landfall there.

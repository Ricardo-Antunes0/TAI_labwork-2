The Family Rain are an English blues rock band, formed in Bath in 2011 by brothers William, Ollie and Timothy Walter. The band released three EPs, several singles and debut album “Under The Volcano”, before splitting up in 2016. The band announced their return in November 2019 via social media. History Before The Family Rain, the three brothers were originally in a Darkness-influenced Rock Pirates, formed in 2004 with guitarist Tom Johnson, who were described as an "irony-free Darkness with bare torsos and blond highlights". The band had "a repertoire of over 10 self-written classics and can also play over 3 hours worth of rock covers". The band changed their name to Dark Horse when they reached 20 and decided to take the band more seriously and released their self-titled debut EP in February 2010. The band initially denied all knowledge of Rock Pirates/Dark Horse, before dismissing their previous incarnation as a "shit covers band" and being formed "when we were learning our instruments".

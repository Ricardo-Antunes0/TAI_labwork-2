The Jazz Singer is a 1927 American musical film directed by Clarence Brown and starring Al Jolson, Eartha Kitt, and Billie Holiday. Based on a story by Rudolf Friml, the film is about a young man who becomes a star vocalist in the early days of jazz music.  The Jazz Singer is regarded as a landmark in the development of American cinema. It was the first feature-length film with a synchronized soundtrack, and its musical style helped to define the screwball comedy genre.

Variant angina, and less commonly Prinzmetal angina, is a type of angina that occurs in people who have a genetic predisposition for the condition. It is also known as familial angina, familial ischemic angina, and familial hypercholesterolemia-induced angina.  Variant angina is a type of angina that occurs in people who have a genetic predisposition for the condition. The most common cause is high blood pressure, but it can also be due to other factors, such as a family history of heart disease or certain genes. Variant angina often occurs in people who have other types of angina, such as stable angina or non-valvular angina.  The symptoms of variant angina are usually mild, but they can occasionally be severe. They include shortness of breath, chest pain, and a feeling of pressure in the chest. Variant angina can also cause fatigue and weakness. It is usually treated with medications to lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart attack.

Pittsburgh is home to the first commercial radio station in the United States, KDKA 1020AM; the first community-sponsored television station in the United States, WQED 13; the first "networked" television station and the first station in the country to broadcast 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, KDKA 2; and the first newspaper published west of the Allegheny Mountains, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Until 2016 Pittsburgh was one of the few mid-sized metropolitan areas in the U.S. with two major daily papers; both the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review have histories of breaking in-depth investigative news stories on a national scale. In 2016, the Tribune-Review moved to an all-digital format. The Post-Gazette moved to publishing five print editions a week in 2018, three print editions a week in 2019, and two print editions a week in 2021. The alternative papers in the region include the Pittsburgh City Paper; Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle; The New People, published weekly by the Thomas Merton Center for Peace and Social Justice; the New Pittsburgh Courier, one of the larger ethnic publications in the region; and Zajedniƒçar, the only Croatian-language newspaper currently published in the United States. The Pitt News, a financially independent student-written and -managed newspaper of the University of Pittsburgh, is closing in on its 100th year of publication. The University of Pittsburgh School of Law also hosts JURIST, the world's only university-based legal news service. Newspapers

Louisiana Highway 975 (LA 975) is a gravel state highway in central Louisiana. It runs north–south for . The southern terminus is at Whiskey Bay in Iberville Parish, and the northern terminus is east of Krotz Springs at a junction with U.S. Route 190 (US 190) and the north, south LA 973, in Pointe Coupee Parish. The entire route traverses the Sherburne Complex WMA, which is a combined Sherburne WMA, Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge, and Bayou Des Ourse, managed by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. The road runs between the Atchafalaya River and Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel on the west and the East Protection Levee on the east. Route description The short route actually runs south of Interstate 10 (I-10) a few miles and makes a loop. The access road from I-10, exit 127 south, has been barricaded and thus the only direction of travel is north. The route is a poorly maintained gravel road that, as most roads of this type, is very dusty during the dry season. Starting in Iberia Parish, LA 975 crosses into St. Martin Parish, then Pointe Coupee Parish before intersecting with US 190. The road travels north through the swampy bottomland of the Atchafalaya Basin, that is part of the Morganza Flood way system, and prone to severe flooding with high water. LA 975 passes Bobtail Bayou, intersects with Bayou Manuel Road, which is at the split of the Atchafalaya River and the beginning of the Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel, then passes the base of Big Alabama Bayou, intersecting with River Road. Continuing north, LA 975 begins to run between the Atchafalaya River, Little Alabama Bayou, and intersects with Happytown Road. At this point Coswell Bayou begins to run in between LA 975 and the Little Alabama Bayou to a point just north of the Point Coupee Parish line. LA 975 intersects Main Road before continuing to the northern terminus at US 190 and LA 973.

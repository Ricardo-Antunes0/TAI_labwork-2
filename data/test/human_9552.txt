Al-Risala al-Qushayriyya fi 'Ilm al-Tasawwuf , mostly known as al-Risala al-Qushayriyya (The Treatise of al-Qushayri), is one of the early complete manuals of the science of Sufism (tasawwuf in Arabic), written by the Shafi'i-Ash'ari scholar Abu al-Qasim al-Qushayri (d. 465/1074). It was written in 438/1045â€“6 and has been published in several editions and translated in various languages, including English, French, German, Persian, Turkish, and Urdu. It became the most widely disseminated handbook of Sufism in the Islamic world. Purpose and authorship  Al-Qushayri's goal was to show the compatibility between mystical teaching and mainstream Sunni Islam. The purpose of authoring the book was to provide a solid structure for Sufism, along with its terminology and principles, and to demonstrate the conformity of Sufi beliefs and practices with the norms of the Shari'a, and to show that the creed of the Sufis was identical to that of the Ahl al-Sunna (in its Ash'ari formulation).

Krishnaswamy Ramiah,  (15 April 1892 â€“ 3 August 1988) was an Indian agricultural scientist, geneticist, parliamentarian and the founder director of Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI), Cuttack, credited with introducing systematic hybridisation programmes in rice breeding in India. The Government of India honoured him in 1957, with the award of Padma Shri, the fourth highest Indian civilian award for his services to the nation and followed it up with the third highest civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan in 1970. Biography Krishnaswamy Ramiah, born in 1892, started his career, in 1914, as a member of research staff at the Paddy Breeding Station in Coimbatore, in Tamil Nadu. In three years time, by 1917, he produced new cross breeds of rice though pure line selection and breed improvement. Later, he introduced systematic hybridisation programmes, known to be the first Indian scientist to pursue such a protocol in rice breeding. When the Government of India established the Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI) in 1946, Ramiah was selected to head the institution as its founder director and continued at his post when the institute was later brought under the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR). During his tenure there, he also led the International Rice Commission, a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) initiative. He was reported to have contributed to the FAO sponsored Indo-Japonica Hybridization programme which yielded the nitrogen responsive rice varieties of Mahsuri, Malinja, ADT 27 and Circna, the first two released in Malaysia, the third in India and the last one, in Australia. He also evolved a number of varieties of rice which include GEB 24, ADT 3, CO 4 and CO 25. The GEB 24 variety is a progenitor for 83 rice varieties developed across countries.

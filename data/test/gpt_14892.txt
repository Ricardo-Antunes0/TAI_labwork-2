Ritual landscapes are extensive archaeological tracts that have been identified as having been used for religious purposes by a specific culture or groups of people. They often contain areas that have been specifically selected and modified for their ritual importance, as well as areas that have been more generally used.  Ritual landscapes are associated with a number of different religious traditions, including those of ancient Europe, the Americas, and Asia. They are also common among certain Native American cultures. Ritual landscapes may be found in locations that are sacred to one or more religions, or they may be located in locations that have special meaning to a particular community.  The creation of a ritual landscape can involve a number of different activities. Typically, it will involve the modification of natural features in order to create areas that are specificially suited for religious purposes. This may include the installation of altars, shrines, or other religious structures. It may also involve the use of symbolism to represent important aspects of religious belief.  Ritual landscapes can be quite extensive in terms of their overall size. They may cover an area that is several hundred square kilometers, or they may be much smaller – typically covering only a few dozen hectares.  Ritual landscapes are usually dated based on the types of artefacts that have been found there – particularly objects that are associated with religious practice. However, this is not always possible, and sometimes ritual landscapes remain undiscovered for centuries.

Infectious canine hepatitis (ICH) is an acute liver infection in dogs caused by Canine mastadenovirus A, formerly called Canine adenovirus 1 (CAV-1).  CAV-1 also causes disease in wolves, coyotes, and bears, and encephalitis in foxes.  The virus is spread in the feces, urine, blood, saliva, and nasal discharge of infected dogs.  It is contracted through the mouth or nose, where it replicates in the tonsils.  The virus then infects the liver and kidneys.  The incubation period is 4 to 7 days. Symptoms include fever, depression, loss of appetite, coughing, and a tender abdomen.  Corneal edema and signs of liver disease, such as jaundice, vomiting, and hepatic encephalopathy, may also occur.  Severe cases will develop bleeding disorders, which can cause hematomas to form in the mouth.  Death can occur secondary to this or the liver disease.  However, most dogs recover after a brief illness, although chronic corneal edema and kidney lesions may persist.

A Better Chance (ABC) is a non-profit organization that provides opportunities for people with disabilities to live independently.  A Better Chance was founded in 1991 by a group of people with disabilities who wanted to create a place where they could have control over their own lives. Today, we continue our mission of providing opportunities and resources to individuals with disabilities so that they can reach their full potential.  Our programs provide individuals with disabilities access to essential services and support, including housing, employment, education and recreation. We also work to increase public awareness about the challenges and opportunities faced by people with disabilities.  We are committed to providing quality services that are accessible and affordable for everyone. We rely on the generosity of our donors and volunteers to support our work. If you would like to help us make a difference in the lives of people with disabilities, please visit our website or give us a call. Thank you for your support!

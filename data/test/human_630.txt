Burton D. Katz (7 July 1937, Chicago – 30 April 2016) was a pizza-maker and owner of Burt's Place, a Morton Grove, Illinois, pizza restaurant. Burt and his wife Sharon achieved worldwide fame in 2009 after being featured on a Chicago-themed episode (5th episode of Season 5) of Anthony Bourdain's television documentary series No Reservations. Burt died in 2016, passing the ownership to two men. Katz grew up in the Wicker Park, Chicago, neighborhood. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps and studied history at Roosevelt University. On their honeymoon, starting in December 1962, Burt and Sharon Katz went on a year-long, around-the-world honeymoon, which was reported in many international newspapers. In 1963 Katz became an owner-partner in an Evanston restaurant, but sold his share in 1965. Katz then opened on Chicago's Howard Street a pizzeria, Gulliver's, selling it in 1968. He then left the restaurant business but returned in 1971, opening Pequod's in Morton Grove. After working 80 to 90 hours a week for 15 years he sold Pequod's in 1985 — the new owners of Pequod's later opened a second location on Chicago's N. Clybourn Avenue.

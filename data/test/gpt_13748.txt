Anna Marie Gueizelor better known as Azurie (10 December 1847 – 7 October 1922) was a French artist.  Azurie was born in Bayonne, in the Basque Country, and moved to Paris at a young age. She initially studied art under Jean-Léon Gérôme, but soon switched to the École des Beaux-Arts, where she studied under Alexandre Cabanel. Her early works are characterized by their bright colors and fluid brushstrokes. Azurie's later works became more subdued and realistic, and she often used natural materials such as flowers and minerals in her paintings. She is best known for her paintings of rural French landscapes, which are often compared to the work of Vincent van Gogh. Azurie died in Paris at the age of 76.

Wales has a surface area of 20,779 km2 or 2,077,900 ha. It has a border with England to the east, and is bounded by the Irish Sea to the north and west, and by the Bristol Channel to the south.  It has an oceanic temperate climate which is markedly influenced by the North Atlantic Current carrying warm water from tropical latitudes. As a result, it has a much milder climate than most places in the world at similar latitudes. Altitudes range from sea-level to 1085 m on the Snowdon Massif. The ways in which land is used in Wales reflect conditions of climate, geology and topography, modified by long traditions of land management. Sheep-grazed pasture predominates in all of the lowland zone, with arable fields mainly confined to the east of the country, although specialised early potato enterprises are favoured by the mild climate of the western peninsulas of Llŷn and Pembrokeshire. Some parts, like the Vale of Tywi and the coastal plain of Ceredigion are famed for dairy farming, as the combinations of soils and climate mean that good quality grass can be reliably grown. In contrast, many more elevated parts of the Welsh land are of limited use for agriculture, and extensive upland conifer forests were planted in the years following the two world wars.  Wild habitats occupy steep land and other areas that are less profitable for commercial use, such as wetlands, moorlands and mountainous terrain. Compared with many countries, wild habitats are scattered and inextensive, but they include significant cliff, dune and other coastal habitats; increasingly rare species-rich pastures and meadows, and wet semi-natural pastures known as rhos in relatively lowland situations. Ffridd grasslands are areas of open, moderately or lightly grazed often minimally managed pastures on the partially enclosed slopes above the cultivated farmland, whilst oak woodlands are found on steep banks and valley sides, and there is an extensive assortment of moorland and mountain vegetation types.  Limestone vegetation is not widespread, but is particularly important to conservationists because so many unusual species occur.

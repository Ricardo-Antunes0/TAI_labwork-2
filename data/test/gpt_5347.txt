The Thessaly rebellion was a Greek revolt that started on July 15, 1600, and ended on September 2, 1600, with the victory of the Ottoman forces.  After the death of Emperor Rudolf II in 1595, the Holy Roman Empire was divided between his three sons. Ferdinand I, who inherited Bohemia and Hungary, was also elected King of Hungary, and he made preparations for a campaign in Greece. The Greek nobility was unhappy with the new ruler and they began to conspire against him.  In 1600, a group of Greek nobles led by Matthias Corvinus landed in Thessaly with the intention of overthrowing Ferdinand I and restoring the former Byzantine Empire. The revolt quickly spread throughout Thessaly and by July 15, 1600 had reached the towns of Larissa and Volos. The Ottoman army arrived in Thessaly in late July and quickly put down the rebellion. Most of the nobles who had led the rebellion were killed or captured, while Corvinus was forced to flee to Venice.

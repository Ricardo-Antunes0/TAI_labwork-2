A black bloc is a tactic used by activists and protesters in which they dress all in black and either block or obstruct police activity or march through counter-demonstrators. The tactic has been used by both conservative and liberal protesters in the United States and Europe.  The black bloc tactic originated in Germany during the 1980s, when anarchist groups called Autonome black blocs would dress all in black and march through the streets to prevent right-wing groups from staging protests. The tactic has since been adopted by a variety of groups, including anti-capitalist, anti-fascist, and environmental activists. In North America, the black bloc tactic has been used mainly by anarchists and left-wing activists against corporate globalization and police brutality.  Critics of the black bloc argue that it can create chaos and hinder free speech, while supporters argue that it can be a powerful symbol of resistance.

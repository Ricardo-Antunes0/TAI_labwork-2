The  ("lightning serpent") is a lightning-spitting serpent deity from the mythology of the Haietlik people, who reside in the area around the headwaters of the White River in present-day Montana.  The Haietlik believe that the Haietlik is a powerful spirit that helps to protect them from harm. In their mythology, the Haietlik is said to have created the world by striking the earth with lightning.

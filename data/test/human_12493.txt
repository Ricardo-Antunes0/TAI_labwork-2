Microtremor is a low amplitude (in the order of micrometres) ambient vibration of the ground caused by man-made or atmospheric disturbances. The term Ambient Vibrations is now preferred to talk about this phenomenon. Observation of microtremors can give useful information on dynamic properties of the site such as predominant period and amplitude. Microtremor observations are easy to perform, inexpensive and can be applied to places with low seismicity as well, hence, microtremor measurements can be used conveniently for seismic microzonation. More detailed information on the shear wave velocity profile of the site can be obtained from microtremor array observation. History  After the pioneering work by Kannai and Tanaka, many researchers have investigated the applicability and reliability of the microtremor method. The major drawback of the method proposed by Kannai and Tanaka  was that they considered the Fourier spectra of observed horizontal motions to reflect the transfer function of the surface. It has now been established that the horizontal microtremor spectra often show the characteristics of the source rather than the transfer function of a site.

Dejan (; fl. 1346–ca. 1366) was a Serbian despot who ruled over the Despotate of Epirus from 1346 to 1366. He was the son of despot Stefan Lazarević and a brother of despot Đurađ II.  During Dejan's reign, the Despotate expanded its territory to encompass Thessaly, eastern Albania and parts of Epirus. He also strengthened his grip on the Serbian throne, which had been weakened by the death of his brother Đurađ II in 1355. In 1357, he captured and executed his rival, Stephen V of Durazzo. Dejan's rule was marked by frequent warfare with Venice, whose maritime empire was expanding in the Mediterranean at the time. In 1369, he was defeated and captured by the Venetians at the Battle of Pantokrator. He was subsequently beheaded and his body thrown into the sea.

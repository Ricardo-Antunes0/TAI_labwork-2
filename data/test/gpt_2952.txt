In its early history, Mexico was occupied by many different cultures and religions. This led to childbirth being carried out in a variety of ways, some of which were quite unusual. For example, in the Aztec culture, childbirth was often assisted by the mother's sister or other female relatives. In pre-Columbian Mexico, childbirth was also often a very dangerous experience, with mothers dying in large numbers.   However, over the years childbirth has become much more safe and normal in Mexico. Today, most women have a natural childbirth without any medical assistance. However, there are still some traditional practices that are used in some rural areas. These include using heated rocks to stimulate labour, and giving women alcoholic drinks to help them relax during labour.

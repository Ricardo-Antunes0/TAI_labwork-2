Porcelænsfabrikken Danmark, now also known as Lyngby Porcelænsfabrik, was a porcelain factory located in Lyngby, Copenhagen, Denmark. It was founded in 1779 by the entrepreneur Lauritz C. Bergsøe and flourished until its closure in 1984.  The factory produced a wide range of porcelain wares, including figurines, vases and plates. The most famous product of the factory was the Copenhagen Royal Plate, which was made from porcelain from the factory's own kiln. The factory also produced porcelain figurines for the royal family of Denmark.  The factory was nationalized in 1948 and remained in public ownership until its closure in 1984. In 1987, it was auctioned off and subsequently demolished.

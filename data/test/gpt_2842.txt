Magnetically confined fusion plasmas such as those used to drive the ITER tokamak are often shaped by electric fields. Plasma shaping is the process of controlling the electric field so that the plasma forms a desired shape.  Plasma shaping is a process used to control the electric field in a fusion plasma so that it forms a desired shape. This shape can be used to control the behavior of the plasma, and thus improve its performance. Plasma shaping can be used to create walls, toroids, and other shapes that help to confine and control the plasma, and thus improve its performance.

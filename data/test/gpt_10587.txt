The Broadcaster was an English language local radio station that operated in Toronto, Ontario from 1953 to 1985. The Broadcaster was the first radio station in Toronto to offer a 24-hour service, and was also the first station in Canada to offer a live, uninterrupted feed of news from overseas.  The Broadcaster's programming was diverse and eclectic, featuring music, news, sports, and talk programming. The station was also known for its live coverage of major events, including the 1976 Toronto International Film Festival, the 1978 Canadian Grand Prix, and the 1981 Pan American Games.  The Broadcaster was acquired by CHUM Limited in 1984 and ceased operations the following year.   The Broadcaster is commemorated in Toronto's Distillery District with a plaque and a statue.

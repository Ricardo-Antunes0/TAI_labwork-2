kephalē  appears some 75 times in the Greek New Testament. It is of considerable interest today because of differences of biblical interpretation between Christian egalitarians and Complementarians as to the intent of the New Testament concerning roles of authority assigned biblically to husbands and wives. A prime example appears in  where all Christians are told: 21Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. and the following three verses say: 22Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. 23For the husband is the head (kephalē) of the wife as Christ is the head (kephalē) of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. 24Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything."NIV Complementarians Complementarians translate "head (kephalē)" in the above verses (and in similar passages in other Pauline epistles) as meaning “presupposed authority", “superior rank", “leader", signifying the servant leadership role a husband has with his wife.

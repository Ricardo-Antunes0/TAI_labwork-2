The pentimal system    is a system of measurement used in both modern and ancient times. It is based on the number five, and is most commonly used to measure length.  The pentimal system was first developed in ancient Egypt, and was used to measure the length of pyramids and other large structures. Today, it is still used to measure the length of things like railway tracks, roads, and buildings.  The pentimal system is based on the number five. Each unit of the pentimal system is based on the number five, and each unit can be divided into five parts. For example, a foot is based on the unit of length, the cubit, which is based on the number five. The cubit can be divided into five parts, which are called feet.

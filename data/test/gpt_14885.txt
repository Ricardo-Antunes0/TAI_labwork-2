House of Leaves is the debut novel by Mark Z. Danielewski, released on October 17, 2002. The book is composed of pages that are not necessarily in the same order as they appear in the book, making it difficult to provide a traditional plot summary.  The novel is set in a unnamed city in the Midwest during the 1990s. It tells the story of Johnny Truant, a young man who discovers that his family home is haunted by an unspeakable evil.

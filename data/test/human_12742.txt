Primo Filmes, led by Joana Mariani, Matias Mariani and Marcelo Monteiro, has produced the feature-films Drained (O Cheiro do Ralo), Fabricating Tom Zé (Fabricando Tom Zé) and 3.5 Overpass (Elevado 3.5). Matias studied film production at New York University and, after directing the short film Rear View of a City (O Não de São Paulo) has specialized in executive production. Joana, who started out as an assistant-director for advertisement shoots, now dedicates herself to production apart from beginning a direction career with the short-film Day-In, day-Out (Cotidiano). Monteiro has brought to Primo his 7 years experience as a producer for the internet portal Terra.   Primo made its film debut with Drained in 2005, which had Matias as the executive producer and Joana as the assistant director. A surprise-hit both in terms of box-office and positive reviews, Drained has been seen by more than 180 thousand people so far, being widely perceived as one of the most successful films of year, representing Brazil in the 2007 Sundance Film Festival. Drained won the 2006 São Paulo International Film Festival and several other awards in festivals around the globe. Films produced

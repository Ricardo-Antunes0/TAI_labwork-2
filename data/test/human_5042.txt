10 to Midnight is a 1983 American crime-horror-thriller film directed by J. Lee Thompson from a screenplay originally written by William Roberts. The film stars Charles Bronson in the lead role with a supporting cast that includes Lisa Eilbacher, Andrew Stevens, Gene Davis, Geoffrey Lewis, and Wilford Brimley. 10 to Midnight was released by City Films, a subsidiary of Cannon Films, to American cinemas on March 11, 1983. Plot Warren Stacey (Gene Davis) is a young office equipment repairman who kills women after they reject his sexual advances. His attempts at flirting are always seen as creepy by women, resulting in frequent rejections. His first victim is Betty Johnson (June Gilbert), an office co-worker. He tracks her down to a wooded area, and observes her having sex with her boyfriend in the back of a van. He ambushes the couple, kills the boyfriend and then gives chase to the naked woman through the woods. He catches her and as she begs for her life, he stabs her to death. At Betty's funeral, Stacey overhears her father mention to Los Angeles police detective Leo Kessler (Charles Bronson) that Betty kept a diary. Fearing he might be mentioned in the diary, Stacey searches Betty's bedroom in her apartment, but is interrupted when Karen Smalley (Jeana Tomasina), Betty's roommate and co-worker returns from the funeral. Stacey stabs her to death in the kitchen and resumes searching for the diary only to discover it has apparently already been found by Kessler.

The Leopold matrix is a qualitative environmental assessment tool that can be used to measure the relative importance of different environmental factors in a given situation.  The Leopold matrix was developed by biologists Leopold von Ranke and Edward O. Wilson in the early 1960s as a way to systematically compare the environmental impacts of different land uses. The Leopold matrix is typically composed of eight factors: density of population, type of vegetation, degree of soil disturbance, kind of waterway, altitude of land, latitude of land, and distance to sources of pollutants. Each factor is assigned a weighting based on its importance in determining the environmental impact of a given land use.

The Central Park Bandstand, also known as the grandstand, was a temporary wooden bandstand built in Central Park in 1876. It was replaced in 1883 by a permanent structure, the Music Pavilion.  The Central Park Bandstand was located in the northeast corner of the park near the Boathouse and the Conservatory. It was a simple open-air structure with a roof and a platform at one end for the band. The platform was surrounded by a railing, and there were steps down to it from either side of the platform. The Bandstand was used for concerts, rallies, and carnivals, as well as for public address speeches.  In 1883, a permanent structure called the Music Pavilion was built in its place. The Pavilion had a much more elaborate design, with a roof and walls that could be closed off for performances. It also had an orchestra pit and seating for 2,500 people. The Central Park Bandstand was eventually destroyed by fire on October 30, 1916.

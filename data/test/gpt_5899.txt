The Kentish Knock is a long shoal of rocks off the north coast of England, close offshore from Lowestoft. It is a popular spot for fishing, and also has a small sandy beach.   The Kentish Knock is one of the many named features in the area. The Knock is thought to derive from the Anglo-Saxon word cnoc, meaning a hill or height. The Kentish Knock is located near the towns of Lowestoft and North Walsham and is part of the East Coast National Park.

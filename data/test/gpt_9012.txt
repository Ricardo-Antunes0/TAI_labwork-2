The S-Bahn Mittelelbe ("Central Elbe S-Bahn", called "Mittelelbe" in German) is a railway line in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt. It connects Magdeburg with Halle and Köthen.  The line was opened on 13 October 1906 by the Chemnitz–Halle Railway Company, which was merged into the Royal Saxon State Railways in 1918. The section from Halle to Köthen was electrified on 15 May 1951. The line has been subject to several upgrades, including the addition of a second track between Magdeburg and Köthen in 2003 and reconstruction of the bridges over the Elbe in 2006.

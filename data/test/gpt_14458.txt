Koraaga was a Castle class steel-hulled trawler that operated in the Antarctic during the early 20th century. She was the first ship to complete a circumnavigation of the world and was the first vessel to document the sea ice conditions around Antarctica.  Koraaga was built in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1914 as a Castle class steel-hulled trawler for the Scottish Antarctic Expedition (SAE). She was the first ship to complete a circumnavigation of the world, and was also the first vessel to document the sea ice conditions around Antarctica. She operated in the Antarctic for over thirty years, during which time she made numerous scientific observations and recorded many firsts, including being the first ship to cross the Antarctic Circle from east to west. In 1957 she was sold to a Japanese company and renamed Maru No. 4. She was retired in 1978 and preserved at Kawasaki Heavy Industries in Kobe, Japan.  Koraaga has been the subject of several documentaries and articles, and is recognised as one of the most significant vessels in Antarctic history. She is currently on display at the Maritime Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.

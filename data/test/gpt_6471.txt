William Bramwell Booth, CH (8 March 1856 – 9 July 1934) was an English actor and theatre director. He is best known for his roles in the plays of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and for his directing of the first production of A Midsummer Night's Dream at the London Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.  Bramwell Booth was born in 1856 in Leicester, the son of William Booth, an industrial chemist, and his wife Rosamund (née Hirst). He began his acting career in 1872, appearing in a number of provincial theatres before making his London debut in 1876 at the Haymarket Theatre. He appeared with great success in many leading Shakespearean roles during the 1880s and 1890s, including Hamlet (1881), Othello (1883), Macbeth (1887), Antony and Cleopatra (1894), Coriolanus (1893) and Richard III (1900).  During the early years of the 20th century, Booth began to focus more on directing than on acting. He directed his first production, A Midsummer Night's Dream, at the London Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1906. Among his other notable stage directing credits are The Merchant of Venice (1906), As You Like It (1913), Twelfth Night (1914) and Julius Caesar (1915).  Booth retired from acting in 1914 but continued to work as a theatre director until his death in 1934. He was knighted in 1902

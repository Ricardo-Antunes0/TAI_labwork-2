The Eastern Iron Brigade, also known as the Iron Brigade of the East, was a unit of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. The brigade was formed in 1862, and fought mainly in the Eastern Theater of the war.  The Eastern Iron Brigade was originally organized as a cavalry regiment in Virginia in 1861. It was redesignated as an infantry brigade in April 1862, and saw its first action at the Battle of Chancellorsville. The brigade was involved in many major battles, including Gettysburg, Petersburg, Appomattox Court House, and Shenandoah Valley Campaign. The brigade was disbanded in October 1865, after the surrender of the Confederate Army.

Emotional choice theory (also referred to as affective choice theory or emotional rationality theory) is a branch of psychology that examines the psychological factors that influence individual choices. The theory focuses on the role of emotions in decision-making and the ways in which emotions can affect our judgments and actions.  Emotional choice theory has been largely developed by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, who initially proposed the concept in a series of papers published in the late 1970s. The theory has been influential in explaining a wide range of behavioral phenomena, including decision making, risk taking, and consumer behavior.  The theory posits that emotions play an important role in decision making by influencing our judgments and actions. Emotions are complex mental states that are characterized by a range of feelings (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, fear) and thoughts (e.g., evaluations of situations, predictions about future events). The theory suggests that emotions can have a direct impact on our decisions by affecting our judgment and reasoning processes.  The theory has been widely used to explain a variety of behavioral phenomena, including decision making under risk, choice under uncertainty, and consumer behavior. The theory has also been used to explain why some people are more likely to make risky decisions than others, why some people are more likely to choose high-risk rewards over low-risk rewards, and why some people are more likely to change their opinions after experiencing new information.

30 is the fourth studio album by English singer-songwriter Adele, released on 19 November 2021 by Melted Stone and Columbia Records. As her return to music after a six-year hiatus since the release of her third studio album 25 (2015), 30 centres on Adele's divorce, motherhood, fame, heartache, acceptance, and hope. Adele wrote 30 between 2018 and 2021 with producers such as Greg Kurstin, Max Martin and Shellback, all of whom worked on 25 as well; new collaborators include Ludwig GÃ¶ransson, and Inflo of the English band Sault. Musically, 30 is a pop, soul, and jazz record. It has been described as Adele's most creative work sonically, expanding on the sound of Adele's past works by incorporating dance-pop and gospel music elements. American jazz pianist Erroll Garner appears on the track "All Night Parking" as a guest act, marking the first time an artist is featured on a standard album by Adele. Upon release, 30 was met with widespread critical acclaim for its cinematic instrumentation, vocal performances, and honest, introspective lyricism. It appeared on the 2021 year-end best-albums lists from various publications.

Natalie Anne Kyriacou OAM (born 1988 in Sydney, Australia) is an Australian artist who specialises in painting and sculpture. Kyriacou has exhibited at various galleries and art fairs around the world, most notably in London, New York, Sydney and Melbourne.  Kyriacou's paintings are infused with a melancholic and dreamlike quality, often featuring elaborate and intricate patterns and designs. Her sculptures are often characterized by their elongated and sinuous shapes, and feature a variety of materials (including wood, metal, plastic and textile) which she combines to create visually striking compositions. Kyriacou's work has been likened to that of artists such as Edward Munch and Gustav Klimt, and she has been described as one of Australia's most promising new artists.

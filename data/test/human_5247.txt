Biography Helmet appeared on the New York underground scene in 1989 after vocalist/guitarist Page Hamilton had left Band of Susans. They were spotted by Tom Hazelmyer and signed to his Amphetamine Reptile Records label, releasing their debut 7 inch single, "Born Annoying", later that year. The label then released their first album, Strap It On, in 1990. After touring in support of that album, Helmet signed to Interscope Records in 1991 and started recording their second album, Meantime, which was released a year later. Meantime was far more successful, peaking at number one on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, and in 68th position on Billboard 200. The critically acclaimed album also provided their first ever charting single "Unsung", which remains one of Helmet's live staples the album has sold over 2 million copies worldwide, and later became the band's only album to achieve Gold status in the United States.

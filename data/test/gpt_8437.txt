Banks v. Manchester, 128 U.S. 244 (1888), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a state legislature did not have the power to prohibit a national bank from doing business in its own state.  The case involved the efforts of the State of Missouri to prohibit the National Bank of Kansas City from doing business in that state. The National Bank was a national bank, meaning that it was chartered by the United States government. The National Bank wanted to open a branch in Missouri, but the Missouri legislature did not want it to do business there. The National Bank sued the Missouri legislature, and the Supreme Court ruled in its favor.

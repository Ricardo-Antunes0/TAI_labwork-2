Sherley Anne Williams (August 25, 1944 – January 11, 2006) was an American singer and songwriter. Williams is best known for her work as a member of the folk rock duo The Byrds, with her husband, Roger McGuinn.  Williams was born in Clarksville, Tennessee, the daughter of Lillian (née Garner) and Floyd Williams. She began singing at age six and by the time she was eleven, she had formed a folk duo with her sister. The two sisters toured throughout the southeastern United States before moving to Los Angeles in 1965. There they met Roger McGuinn, a fellow musician, and formed The Byrds.  The Byrds achieved international success with their folk-influenced acoustic rock music. They recorded eight albums between 1965 and 1973 before disbanding. Williams continued to write and record music independently until her death from pancreatic cancer in 2006 at the age of 60.

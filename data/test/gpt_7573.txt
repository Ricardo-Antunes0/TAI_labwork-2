Microlites are minute crystals in an amorphous matrix, typically less than 1 millimeter in size. Microlites are typically produced by the thermal decomposition of mineral matter at temperatures below 1000 degrees Celsius. They have a wide variety of applications including energy storage, optoelectronics, and medical imaging.

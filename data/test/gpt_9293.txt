Within the fields of molecular biology and organic chemistry, a small molecule is a molecule that is smaller than a macromolecule. Small molecules can be classified according to their size, including small organic molecules, small inorganic molecules, and small nucleic acids.  Whereas large molecules are composed of many atoms arranged in a specific way, small molecules are typically composed of only a few atoms arranged in a specific way. This difference in structure has important consequences for the way in which small molecules interact with one another and with larger molecules. For example, small molecules are more likely to pass through the walls of cells than are large molecules and to enter and leave the cells more easily. Additionally, small molecules can interact with biological receptors more effectively than can large molecules.

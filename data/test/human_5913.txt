NVR, Inc. is a company engaged in home construction. It also operates a mortgage banking and title services business. The company primarily operates on the East Coast of the United States. In February 2010, NVR Inc was sued by the Attorney General of Delaware for failing to provide promised amenities for the residents of a housing development that the company built. In 2018, 23% of home settlements occurred in the Washington metropolitan area and 8% of home settlements occurred in the Baltimore metropolitan area.  The company operates under the Ryan Homes, NVHomes and Heartland Homes brands. The company typically does not engage in land development; it acquires finished land lots that are ready for building, which mitigates risk. As of 2019, the company is the 4th largest home construction company in the United States based on the number of homes closed. It is ranked 383rd on the Fortune 500 as of December 2021.

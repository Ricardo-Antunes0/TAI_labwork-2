The Laws of the Twelve Tables was the legislation that stood at the foundation of Roman law. Formally promulgated in 449 BC, the Tables consolidated earlier traditions into an enduring set of laws. Displayed in the Forum, "The Twelve Tables" stated the rights and duties of the Roman citizen.  Their formulation was the result of considerable agitation by the plebeian class, who had hitherto been excluded from the higher benefits of the Republic.  The law had previously been unwritten and exclusively interpreted by upper-class priests, the pontifices.  Something of the regard with which later Romans came to view the Twelve Tables is captured in the remark of Cicero (106â€“43 BC) that the "Twelve Tables...seems to me, assuredly to surpass the libraries of all the philosophers, both in weight of authority, and in plenitude of utility".  Cicero scarcely exaggerated; the Twelve Tables formed the basis of Roman law for a thousand years.

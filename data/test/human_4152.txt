Beckenham Place Park is a large park located near Beckenham in the London Borough of Lewisham. It lies close to the border with the London Borough of Bromley. The Palladian-style mansion that gave the park its name now serves as a community centre and caf√©. History of the park Although so named because John Cator the younger established the park between 1757/60 and 1785 and acquired the rights of the Manor of Beckenham, it transpires that most of the land in the current park was in the neighbouring Manor of Foxgrove and some nearby Lewisham Lands that once belonged to the Forsters of Southend, Lewisham and the Earl of Rockingham/Sondes/Lees Court estate. Several accounts of the history of the park require amendment due to recent rediscoveries from different archives. The Friends of Beckenham Place Park endeavour to compile an accurate history based on archive material in the British Library, Kent, Essex and Surrey Archives.  Bromley and Lewisham Local Studies Libraries.

The GreinerMurray ministry (199192) or Second GreinerMurray ministry or Second Greiner ministry was the 81st ministry of the New South Wales Government, and was led by the 37th Premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner, representing the Liberal Party in coalition with the National Party, led by Wal Murray. Buoyed by his government's strong performance in the polls, Greiner called a snap election for 25 May 1991. Despite widespread predictions by political and media commentators that Greiner would be easily re-elected to a second term, the impact of the Government's policies, particularly in terms of service cuts and increased charges, caused many voters to turn to Labor.  The 1991 state election saw the Coalition win 52 percent of the two-party vote.  However, much of the Coalition's margin was in its heartland, while Labor won many marginal seats it had lost in its severe defeat of three years prior.  The result was a hung Parliament, with the Coalition one seat short of a majority.  Greiner was forced into a minority government, relying on support from four independent politicians. Greiner's parliamentary majority was further eroded with the decision of Terry Metherell to become an Independent in late 1991, and with the loss of The Entrance in a 1992 by-election following a Court of Disputed Returns overthrowing the original result.

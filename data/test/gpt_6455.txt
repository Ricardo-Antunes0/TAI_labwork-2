Martialis (P. Aelius) was a Roman soldier and poet of the 1st century AD.  Martialis was born in Spain, the son of a military tribune. He enlisted in the Roman army in AD 20 and served in Hispania and Africa. In his poetry, Martial often reflects on his military experiences, mixing praise for Roman victories with bitter criticism of Roman enemies.  After the death of his father, Martial moved to Rome where he began to write poetry. His first book of poems, entitled Epigrams, was published in AD 38. In it, he celebrated the joys and privileges of the upper class while attacking the vices of the aristocracy and the decadence of Rome. His second book, called Martialis Liber or Epigrams on Various Subjects, was published in AD 44. It is more philosophical and deals with wider topics such as love and happiness.  Martial died in Rome in AD 104.

The hulusi (traditional: 葫蘆絲; simplified: 葫芦丝; pinyin: húlúsī) is a type of Chinese embroidery. It is made from the downy feathers of a kind of goose, mainly the Canada goose, but sometimes other geese are used.   A hulusi is composed of a surface or foundation fabric, which is usually cotton or linen, and a series of finely-woven loops or stitches made from the downy feathers of geese or other birds. The loops are either solid colors or adorned with delicate patterns. The foundation fabric is often divided into panels, which are then joined together in a variety of ways to create the final piece.

The history of lighthouses refers to the development of the use of towers, buildings, or other types of structure, as an aid to navigation for maritime pilots at sea or on inland waterways. Premodern era Before the development of clearly defined ports, mariners were guided by fires built on hilltops. Since raising the fire would improve the visibility, placing the fire on a platform became a practice that led to the development of the lighthouse. In antiquity, the lighthouse functioned more as an entrance marker to ports than as a warning signal for reefs and promontories, unlike many modern lighthouses. Excavation at Kuntasi on the coast of what is now India has revealed a square watch tower with a ramp which would have originally been 10â€“12 meters which was used to guide boats coming to Kuntasi from Rann of Kutch, possibility of it being lighthouse cannot be ruled out. If so, the lighthouse would date from about 2000 BCE.

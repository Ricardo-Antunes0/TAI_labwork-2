Andrew Guenther (born 1976) is an American artist based in Brooklyn, New York. Guenther received his BFA from Lawrence University in 1998 and his MFA from Rutgers University in 2000. His work has been widely exhibited in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Guenther makes paintings, sculptures, and photographs, and his works often combine elements of painting and sculpture, as he has incorporated items such as underwear, T-shirts, sunglasses, and cigars into his paintings and more recently begun employing papier-mâché and gold and silver leaf in his mixed-media pieces. While Guenther's earlier work, which referenced death metal, zombies, satyrs, hippie kitsch and drew comparisons to painters such as Francisco Goya and Hieronymous Bosch, has been called “iconoclastic, demented, decadent,”  his more recent paintings have focused on a recurring “Plate Face” character, whales, dolphins, and more abstract concerns and have been described as evocative of Abstract Expressionism and outsider art.

Tregaron Estate, formerly known as The Causeway, is a country house situated in the parish of Castleton, Northumberland, England. The estate covers an area of 2,000 acres and is currently being run as a hotel by the Tregaron Estate Hotel Company.  The estate was originally built in 1720 for Archibald Campbell, 6th Duke of Argyll. It was later acquired by the Marquess of Londonderry and then, in 1901, by the American financier and philanthropist William H. Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt leased the estate to Walter Gropius and his wife until their death in 1949. It was subsequently purchased by Sir Laurence Olivier and his second wife, Vivien Leigh, who used it as their primary home from 1952 until Leigh's death in 1967.  In 1968, Olivier sold the estate to the then Lord Fortescue, who subsequently leased it to Rolf Harris and his first wife Jean Harris until their divorce in 1985. The estate then became the property of Nigel Platt and his wife Joanne Woodward until their death in 1992.   In 1994, the estate was purchased by the current owners, who have since restored it to its former glory. The estate now operates as a hotel with guest rooms, a restaurant, a spa, a golf course and several cottages.

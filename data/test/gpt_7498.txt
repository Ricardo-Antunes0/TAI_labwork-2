The Mensch Computer is a personal computer designed for the general public by Steve Jobs and introduced on January 9, 1984. The name is a portmanteau of "man" and "computer", and is meant to suggest that the computer is both user-friendly and intelligent.  The Mensch Computer was one of the earliest mass-market personal computers, and its design influenced many subsequent personal computers. In 1984, it had a simple, intuitive interface and was affordable at $1,299. It had a 640x200 resolution screen, 5 MB of RAM, a 3.5 inch floppy disk drive, and a 8 KB hard drive. Its operating system was MS-DOS 3.3.

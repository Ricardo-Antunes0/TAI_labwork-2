An intact forest landscape (IFL) is an ecologically and aesthetically intact forest, where natural processes such as wildfires, wind, and insects maintain the forest's diversity and structure. IFLs are important for biodiversity conservation, carbon storage, and water filtration.  There are many benefits to maintaining an IFL. They provide habitat for a variety of animals and plants, help reduce the effects of climate change, and provide a source of income for local communities. However, IFLs are threatened by a number of factors, including deforestation, urban development, and climate change.  Intact forest landscapes are an important part of the global biodiversity conservation effort. They are home to a variety of plant and animal species that can't be found in other types of landscapes, and they provide a source of food and fiber for people. Intact forest landscapes also help reduce the effects of climate change.  There are many ways to maintain an IFL. Governments, non-profit organizations, and individual citizens can work to preserve forests through initiatives like reforestation or land management programs. Additionally, forests can be protected through national or international laws.

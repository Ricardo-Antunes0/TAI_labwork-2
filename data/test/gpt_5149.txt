"Love Come Down" is a song written by Terence Trent D'Arby and John Lennon. It was produced by the Beatles and released on their album, "The Beatles" in 1968.  The song is a ballad with a slow tempo and acoustic guitar accompaniment. The lyrics tell the story of a man who has been hurt by love, and who is waiting for it to come down from the sky. D'Arby's vocals are somber and plaintive, while Lennon provides a heartfelt vocal harmony.  "Love Come Down" was well received by critics when it was released, many of whom compared it to Lennon's earlier work with the Beatles. It has since been included on numerous lists of the greatest Lennon songs, and has been performed live by D'Arby and other artists.  Terence Trent D'Arby (born February 4, 1948) is an English singer-songwriter and musician.

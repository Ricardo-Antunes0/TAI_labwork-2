She was also the first woman to receive a doctorate in chemistry from the University of Warsaw.  Justyna Budzińska-Tylicka was born in 1867 in Łódź, then in the Grand Duchy of Warsaw.

In 1887, Budzińska-Tylicka began her studies at the University of Warsaw, where she studied chemistry under Professor Stanisław Skalski. Skalski was a respected chemist who had made significant contributions to the understanding of lithium and its compounds. Budzińska-Tylicka benefited from his guidance, and quickly became one of Skalski's most promising students. In 1890, she received her doctorate degree in chemistry from the University of Warsaw.

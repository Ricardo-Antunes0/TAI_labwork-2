Francesco Pesellino (probably 1422â€“July 29, 1457), also known as Il Pesellino, was an Italian painter of the Quattrocento. His birthplace is unknown, but he may have been from the town of Pesaro. He is considered one of the most important painters of the early Italian Renaissance and is especially noted for his depictions of religious subjects, including the Madonna and Child, Saints Peter and Paul, and the Annunciation. Pesellino is also noted for his use of light and shadow to create a sense of depth in his paintings.  Pesellino probably trained with Fra Filippo Lippi and then worked in Florence before moving to Rome around 1450. He became known as one of the most important painters in Rome and was highly sought after by popes, cardinals, and other important figures. He died in Rome in 1457 at the age of only 46 years old.

The Second Government of the Prime Minister is the federal cabinet of Canada, which is composed of the Prime Minister and his or her cabinet ministers. The cabinet is responsible to Parliament for the administration of government policies and programs. It is also responsible for the formulation of government policy, as well as for the direction and management of the civil service.  The Second Government was sworn in on July 18, 2008, following the 2007 federal election that resulted in a majority government for the Liberal Party. The First Government of Prime Minister Paul Martin was dissolved on May 26, 2008, following the Liberal Party's loss of a majority in the House of Commons. The Second Government was formed by combining the portfolios of Finance and National Defence, as well as taking over Environment and Natural Resources from the first government.  The Second Government has faced a number of challenges since its formation. The global economic recession has had a significant impact on many areas of government policy, with cuts to federal spending being made in response. In addition, relations between Canada and United States have been strained by a number of issues, most notably Canadian calls for stronger environmental protection measures and U.S. objections to Canadian softwood lumber shipments to Europe.

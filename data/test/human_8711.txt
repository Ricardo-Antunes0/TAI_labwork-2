EastWest Bank , more formally known as East West Banking Corporation, is the eleventh largest bank in the Philippines in terms of assets. It is a member of the Filinvest Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the Philippines founded by the late tycoon Andrew Gotianun. Its headquarters is at The Beaufort, a condominium building by Filinvest in Bonifacio Global City. History EastWest Bank was created on July 6, 1994. It was on that date that the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas granted EastWest Bank its commercial banking license. Backed-up by the Filinvest Group of Companies, EastWest Bank opened to the public along Senator Gil Puyat Avenue, Makati on August 1, 1994. This was the comeback of the Gotianun's in the banking space after they sold the Insular Bank of Asia and America to PCIBank in 1986 (which was acquired by Equitable Bank forming Equitable PCI Bank which in turn was acquired by Banco De Oro in 2006) and Family Savings Bank to BPI (which was renamed BPI Family Savings Bank).

The Anointed Quorum, also known as the Holy Anointing, is a term used in the Latter Day Saint movement to describe a group of men who have been ordained to the priesthood by Joseph Smith.  The Anointed Quorum is designated as the highest authority in the church, ranking above the local priesthood leaders and the general priesthood. The membership of the quorum is limited to men who have been ordained to the priesthood by Joseph Smith. The quorum is also known as the Holy Priesthood and is said to be "the keystone of our religion" because it "holds the keys of authority" in the church.  The quorum is said to be composed of "true priests and prophets", and members are said to be "called of God" to join it. The quorum is also said to be "the repository of all ecclesiastical ordinances in this dispensation".

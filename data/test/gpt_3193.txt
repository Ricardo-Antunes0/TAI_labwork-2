It was discovered by Charles Messier on September 7, 1764, and is located at a distance of about 18 parsecs (46 light years) from Earth.  NGC 869 is a moderately large open cluster with an estimated diameter of about 30 light years and a total number of about 150 stars. It is relatively young, having been formed about 4.5 million years ago, and is still expanding. The main component of NGC 869 is a well-formed main sequence star cluster with an age of about 1 million years. However, there are also a number of faint background stars in the cluster.  The brightest member of NGC 869 is alpha Persei, which has a spectral type A3 III and is about 2.5 times as massive as the Sun. Other prominent stars in NGC 869 include beta Persei, gamma Persei, eta Persei, and nu Persei. The cluster is located near the border of the constellations Perseus and Camelopardalis and can be seen with the naked eye under good conditions.

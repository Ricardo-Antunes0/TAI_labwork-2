A royal commission is a major ad-hoc committee or commission, often appointed for a specific purpose, like investigating a problem.  Royal commissions are different from other forms of inquiry in that they are appointed by the head of state or government, usually with the advice of the prime minister or president. This gives them a sense of legitimacy and weight that is not usually found in other inquiries.  The use of royal commissions has been controversial in part because they can be used to sweep away political opposition and to bury embarrassing revelations. But royal commissions have also played an important role in exposing government corruption and in forcing governments to change their policies.

A diploma mill (also known as a fake diploma mill, fake degree mill, or fake certificate mill) is a business that produces fake academic degrees and other academic certificates. The business may operate as a stand-alone company, or it may be part of a larger organization that produces fraudulent documents.  The market for bogus academic degrees and other academic certificates has grown rapidly in recent years, as the demand for such documents has increased in countries around the world. This demand has been driven in part by the fact that many employers and colleges require proof of a person's educational qualifications before hiring or enrolling them in courses or programs. diploma mills have also become popular among criminals and fraudsters who use them to obtain legitimate jobs or financial benefits.   diploma mills typically produce a wide variety of counterfeit academic degrees and other academic certificates. These documents may include fake diplomas, fake degrees, fake transcripts, and fake letters of recommendation. diploma mills may also produce counterfeit identification cards, Social Security cards, and other official-looking documents.   diploma mills can be difficult to detect and prosecution can be difficult because they often operate in stealth mode. In order to identify a diploma mill, investigators often rely on tips from members of the general public who have noticed suspicious activity related to the production of phony academic documents.

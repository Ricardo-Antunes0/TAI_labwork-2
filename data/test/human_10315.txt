Lubachevsky-Stillinger (compression) algorithm (LS algorithm, LSA, or LS protocol) is a numerical procedure suggested by F. H. Stillinger and B.D. Lubachevsky that simulates or imitates a physical process of compressing an assembly of hard particles. As the LSA may need thousands of arithmetic operations even for a few particles, it is usually carried out on a computer. Phenomenology A physical process of compression often involves a contracting hard boundary of the container, such as a piston pressing against the particles. The LSA is able to simulate such a scenario. However, the LSA was originally introduced in the setting without a hard boundary where the virtual particles were "swelling" or expanding in a fixed, finite virtual volume with periodic boundary conditions. The absolute sizes of the particles were increasing but particle-to-particle relative sizes remained constant. In general, the LSA can handle an external compression and an internal particle expansion, both occurring simultaneously and possibly, but not necessarily, combined with a hard boundary. In addition, the boundary can be mobile.

Hans Orifice is a drummer best known as a member of Gwar. Born Jim Thomson, in Alexandria, Virginia, he first took the name Hans Sphincter, and assumed his current name in 1987. Thomson left due to touring commitments with his main band, the Alter Natives, who released three albums on SST Records. Richmond drummer Rob Mosby of the Richmond, Virginia punk group White Cross then joined Gwar until 1989. Hans Orifice returned briefly in 1989 after Mosby left the group. During this time Thomson co-wrote Sick of You with the band and completed a U.S. and Canadian tour. After the tour Thomson left Gwar on good terms to tour with The Alter Natives. He was replaced by current drummer Jizmak Da Gusha. In 2000, Thomson joined Bob Miller, and formed an experimental group called Plasmodium. The group released Clairaudience in 2004. Thomson joined Brooklyn-based CSC Funk Band as a drummer and percussionist in 2008. In 2010 he started Electric Cowbell Records, a boutique record label releasing mostly 7-inch 45RPM records for genre-bending music groups culled from his extended community and network of musicians and music producers.

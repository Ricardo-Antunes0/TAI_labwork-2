James Burton Robertson (b. in London 15th December, 1922) is a British composer, conductor and pianist. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. He studied composition with Ralph Vaughan Williams and conducting with Sir Adrian Boult at the Royal College of Music. Robertson's early works were influenced by Arnold Bax and Igor Stravinsky, but he has since developed an individual style that is characterised by its use of melodic and harmonic fragments, rhythmic polyphony and a wide range of textures. He has written several operas, including The Wreck of the Deutschland (1957), The Light of the World (1962) and Children of the Sun (1981), as well as symphonies, concertos, chamber music and choral works. Robertson has been awarded numerous prizes and awards, including a Grammy Award for Best Classical Composition in 1998 for his Symphony No. 6 "A Whirlwind".

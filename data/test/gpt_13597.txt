Yair Lev (born 1959, in Tel Aviv) is an Israeli artist and sculptor.  Lev studied at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, where he was a pupil of Yitzhak Lifshitz. He lives and works in Tel Aviv.  Lev's sculptures are characterised by their organic form, their use of found objects, and their often unfinished appearance. His work has been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Centre Pompidou in Paris, and the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra. In 2013, Lev was awarded the Israel Prize for his artistic accomplishments.

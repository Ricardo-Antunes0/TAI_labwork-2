The West Cross Route (WCR) is a major north-south thoroughfare in the US state of New York. It stretches from the Pennsylvania state line in the north to the Massachusetts state line in the south, and is a principal route between the Hudson Valley and the Great Lakes region. The WCR intersects with Interstate 87 and Interstate 390 in the Rochester area, as well as Interstate 81 and Interstate 290 in the Syracuse area.  The WCR begins at the Pennsylvania state line, where it intersects U.S. Route 11. US 11 runs east-west on the north side of the state line, while US 20 follows a more southerly route on the other side. The WCR runs north-south for about before forming a Y with US 11 and continuing northward. The WCR continues along this trajectory for another before meeting I-87 in Rochester and I-390 in Syracuse.  The WCR is a major artery for commerce and transportation in upstate New York. It is also a popular route for tourists and residents of nearby cities and towns to travel to other parts of New York State or to other states or countries.

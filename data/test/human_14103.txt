The Faliero Coup was a failed 1355 coup designed to overthrow Venice's established republican government. Strains between the Venetian commoners and the nobility, originally stemming from the catastrophic failure of the nobility in the Battle of Porto-Longo against Venice's long-time rival, Genoa, are largely considered to be the main cause for the coup. However, traditional stories also point to the marriage of Doge Marino Faliero as a possible cause for the coup. Faliero, an 81 year old man, had recently taken a young bride, who was rumored to be engaged in multiple affairs, including with Michele Steno, a Venetian statesman and future Doge. The consistent rumors and apparent intense arrogance of the established Venetian elite seems to have gotten to Faliero in this explanation for a coup. A more reasonable one, however, is that Faliero wished to transform Venice into a dictatorship, mirroring those of Genoa and other northern Italian city-states. This view is, however, disputed by some historians, who cite Faliero's apparent regret at his trial, and, his lack of mentioning his belief that a dictatorship would better suit Venice's interests, a valid argument. These two actions are much more consistent with a man regretting a passionate crime, than one who had executed a calculated plan, some argue. The coup was poorly organized and abortive.  Faliero convened with two popular, wealthy, public figures who also had quarrels with the nobility: Bertuccio Isarello and Filippo Calendario. After convincing them of the need for a coup, he laid out his plan: Faliero and Isarello would recruit 20 trusted men who would assist in the overthrow of the government, who would each in turn recruit another 40.

Astrantia minor, the lesser masterwort, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is endemic to the eastern United States, where it is known from only two locations in eastern North Carolina.  Astrantia minor is a small herbaceous perennial growing to 20-30 cm tall, with slender stems and leaves. The leaves are oblong or lance-shaped, up to 15 cm long and 5 cm wide, and have coarsely toothed margins. The lower leaves are smaller and less broadly spaced than the upper ones. The inflorescence is a cluster of mostly single flowers, each up to 8 cm wide, with a tubular throat and pointed petals. The flowers are blue or violet, with darker veins on the petals. The fruit is a capsule about 2 cm long.   Astrantia minor grows in moist areas near streams and ponds, in open forest or on sandy soils. It is threatened by habitat loss.

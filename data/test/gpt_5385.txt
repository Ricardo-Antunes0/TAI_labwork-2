Basalt  is an aphanitic extrusive igneous rock formed from the cooling and solidification of lava. Basalt is very fine grained, and has a phaneritic texture. The mineralogy of basalt typically contains plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine, with amphibole, ilmenite and magnetite less common. Basalt is usually grey to black in colour, but can also be quite light coloured. Basalt often contains small amounts of quartz and feldspar. Basalt is sometimes used as a building material, because of its strength and low cost.  Basalt is a relatively common intrusive igneous rock.

The Lakeview Generating Station was an Ontario power plant located in the town of Pickering, north of Toronto. It operated from 1954 to 1987 and was the first large-scale coal-fired power station in Ontario.  The plant was built on the site of the Pickering Colliery, which had been in operation since 1875. It was one of the largest coal-fired stations in North America and its generating capacity was 1,160 megawatts (MW).  Lakeview was decommissioned in 1987 and closed down due to environmental concerns. The plant'soutput was replaced by a hydroelectric dam at Pickering Falls, which became the Pickering Power Station.

The Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB), now defunct, was a bank based in Beirut in Lebanon, which maintained a network of 35 branches in Lebanon and a representative office in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The bank was established in 1960 as Banque des Activities Economiques SAL and was a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Canada Middle East from 1968 to 1988, when it became a privately owned Lebanese bank.  LCB provided a broad range of corporate, retail, and investment products, and  maintained extensive correspondent accounts with banks worldwide, including several U.S. financial institutions. In 2009 LCB's total assets were worth more than $5 billion. In 2011, the US Drug Enforcement Administration and US Treasury and other US government authorities took legal action against LCB alleging that LCB had helped launder hundreds of millions of dollars monthly for a drug trafficking network between South America and the Middle East and Europe, via West Africa, a network which also helped the funding of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations and money laundering for the narcotics community. However, the US authorities declined to reveal the basis for these claims, which were denied by Hezbollah. The US Treasury Department banned LCB from dealing in dollars, resulting in the sale of the bank. In any event, in 2013, LCB agreed to pay $102 million in settlement of the action.

Agonism (from Greek ἀγών agon, "struggle") is a term used in the field of anatomy and physiology to describe a muscle contraction characterized by high levels of force and energy output. Agonism is contrasted with agonism, which is a muscle contraction characterized by low levels of force and energy output.

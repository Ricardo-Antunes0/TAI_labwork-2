Her family was very affluent and influential.  Upon completing elementary school, she entered the Hikami Senior School in Kashihara in 1885, and was one of only three girls in the school. One of her teachers there, Makiko Imai, encouraged Inoue to continue her education, but her father felt that she had had adequate education for a girl. With her grandmother's encouragement, he finally allowed her in 1890 to begin attending the , the oldest girls' high school in Japan. As her English scores were poor, Inoue began studying English to prepare, taking both formal classes and private instruction. One of the other students at the school was Kameko Hirooka, daughter of the founder of Japan Women's University, Asako Hirooka and she became close to the family.

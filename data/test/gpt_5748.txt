Religious socialism is a type of socialism that is based on religious principles. It is characterized by a belief in socialism as a means of achieving salvation and eternal happiness, and by the assumption that socialism is the only way to achieve economic justice.   Religious socialism has been present in many different forms over the years. The earliest examples can be found in the Hebrew Bible, where prophets such as Isaiah and Jeremiah spoke about the need for a just society that would be based on righteousness and justice. Religious socialism also appears in the writings of classical philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle, who argued that a just society should be based on the principles of virtue and wisdom.  During the 19th century, religious socialism began to take shape in Europe. Many of the leading figures in this movement were members of the Catholic Church, who believed that socialism was a way of achieving salvation. They argued that capitalism was flawed because it was based on greed and selfishness, and that it was necessary to create a society based on principles of brotherhood and equality.  Most religious socialists today are members of Protestant churches, although there are also religious socialists from other faiths. They continue to argue that socialism is the only way to achieve economic justice, and they believe that it can provide people with the kinds of benefits that they need to achieve eternal happiness.

In auctions, the buyer's premium is a fee charged by the auctioneer or seller to buyers for items purchased in an auction. The buyer's premium is usually a percentage of the final bid price, though it may also be set at a fixed amount. The buyer's premium is intended to cover the costs associated with the auction, such as commissions paid to the auctioneer, and is usually added to the final bid price.

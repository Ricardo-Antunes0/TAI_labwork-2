The Stadler Euro (known as the Vossloh Euro in Germany) is a light rail vehicle manufactured by Stadler Rail. It was announced on 28 October 2009 and entered service in late 2011.  The Stadler Euro is a low-floor, articulated electric light rail vehicle designed to operate in urban and suburban areas. It has a capacity of up to 350 passengers, making it the largest light rail vehicle in operation in Europe. The Stadler Euro is also the first light rail vehicle to be built in Austria.  The Stadler Euro was jointly developed by Stadler Rail and Bombardier Transportation, and has been manufactured at the company's factory in Graz, Austria. The first vehicles were delivered to Vienna's Wien Mitte station in late 2011, and began operating on the city's tram network the following year. In February 2013, it was announced that the Stadler Euro would enter service on Milan's new metro network.

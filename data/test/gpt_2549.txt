Maurice "Mo" Drake (20 May 1928 â€“ 10 October 1998) was an American singer, songwriter and record producer. He was one of the most successful solo African Americans in popular music history, earning six platinum and five gold albums over a career that spanned more than five decades.  Drake began his career as a gospel vocalist in the late 1940s, recording with the pioneering gospel group the Soul Stirrers. He soon began recording secular soul music for the local Los Angeles market, and by the early 1960s had established himself as one of the city's leading soul singers. In 1965, he signed with Atlantic Records, and released his debut album, "Mo" (1965). The album yielded two hit singles, "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" and "In My Own Time".  Drake continued to release successful music throughout the 1960s and 1970s, achieving international chart success with such hits as "God's Plan" (1972), "Take Care of You" (1973), "Innervisions" (1975), and "Hold On, I'm Coming Home" (1978). He produced several albums throughout his career, including "Ladies First" (1978), "Now Is the Time" (1981), "Midnight Special" (1982), and "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" (1998). Drake has been nominated for eleven Grammy Awards, winning three. He was inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the NAACP Image Awards Hall

Afro-Grenadians are Grenadian people of largely African descent. The majority of Afro-Grenadians live on the island of Grenada.  Afro-Grenadians are descendants of enslaved Africans who were brought to Grenada in the 17th and 18th centuries. Many came from the Windward Islands, and later from Saint Lucia, Trinidad, and Tobago. They made up about one-third of the population of Grenada by the early 20th century.  During the early years of independence from Britain in the 1960s, Afro-Grenadians were among the first groups to demand political representation. In 1974, they formed their own party, the Grenada United Labour Party (GULP), which won two seats in the general elections that year. However, GULP was banned from participating in subsequent elections because it did not meet the requirements for a legal political party.  In 2003, Afro-Grenadians established the Grenada Association for Studies and Research (GASR), which is dedicated to documenting and preserving Afro-Grenadian culture. GASR also promotes understanding between Afro-Grenadians and other Grenadians, and between Grenada and African countries.

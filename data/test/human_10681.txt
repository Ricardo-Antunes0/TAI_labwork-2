The Banda della Magliana (, Magliana Gang) is an Italian criminal organization based in Rome. It was founded in 1975. Given by the media, the name refers to the original neighborhood, the Magliana, of some of its members. The Banda della Magliana was heavily involved in criminal activities during the Italian Years of Lead (anni di piombo). The Italian government claimed that the Banda della Magliana was closely allied with and tied to other criminal organizations such as Cosa Nostra, Camorra and 'Ndrangheta. It also had links to neofascist militant and terrorist groups such as the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari (NAR), responsible for the 1980 Bologna massacre; the Italian secret services (SISMI), and political figures such as Licio Gelli, grand-master of the freemasonic lodge Propaganda Due (P2). Along with Gladio, the NATO clandestine anti-communist organization, P2 was involved in a strategy of tension during the Years of Lead which included false flag terrorist attacks.

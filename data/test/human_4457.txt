Francesca Calearo (born 16 January 2002), known professionally as Madame, is an Italian rapper and singer-songwriter. After signing a recording contract with Sugar Music at the age of 16, she gained popularity in August 2019, when her single "Sciccherie" was shared by Cristiano Ronaldo on his Instagram profile. Between 2019 and 2020, she released several singles as a lead artist and collaborations with, among others, Marracash, Negramaro, DRD, Ghali, Ensi and producer Chris Nolan, and she competed in the 71st Sanremo Music Festival in March 2021. Her entry "Voce", as well as the single "Il mio amico" recorded with Fabri Fibra, were included in her debut album Madame, released on 19 March 2021. Biography Francesca Calearo was born in Vicenza on 16 January 2002, and raised in Creazzo, also in the province of Vicenza. As a child, she developed an interest in music thanks to her father, an amateur musician with an interest in Italian cantautori. During the lower secondary school years, Calearo started taking piano lessons, and she later continued to study music as an autodidact, while listening to artists like Ludovico Einaudi. She studied Human Sciences at the liceo Don Giuseppe Fogazzaro in Vicenza. She chose the pseudonym "Madame" after trying a random generator for drag queen names, which produced "Madame Wild" for Calearo. She found it represented the idea of "elegance and sophistication" she wanted to pursue, as well as her will to be "a Woman with capital W".

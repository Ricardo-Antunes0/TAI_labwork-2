William Davis (June 3, 1887 â€“ June 20, 1944) was an American coal miner and labor organizer who was killed in a mining accident.  Davis was born in a small coal-mining town in southwestern Pennsylvania, and began working in the mines at age 12. He became a leader of the United Mine Workers of America (UMW), and served as its national president from 1941 to 1943. During his tenure, he successfully fought for improved working conditions and increased wages for coal miners. Davis was also an advocate for the rights of immigrants, and helped organize strikes by Italian and Ukrainian workers. He was fatally injured in a mining accident in 1944, and is buried in the Uniontown Cemetery in Pennsylvania.  Davis was an important figure in American labor history, and his death marked the end of an era for the UMW. His legacy includes numerous memorials and awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Davis is considered one of the most influential labor leaders of the 20th century, and his death has been cited as a factor contributing to the decline of organized labor in the United States.

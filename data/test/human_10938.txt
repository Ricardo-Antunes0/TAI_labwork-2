The Pistol emoji  is an emoji usually displayed as a green or orange toy gun or water gun, but displayed as a handgun on some older systems. In 2016, the emoji faced controversy due to its perceived meanings. In the same year, Apple replaced its realistic revolver design with a toy. In 2018, most major platforms also followed to change the emoji. The use of pistol emojis has also resulted in several arrests and imprisonment based on credible threats, according to authorities. Development and usage history The pistol emoji was originally included in proprietary emoji sets from SoftBank Mobile and au by KDDI. In 2007, Apple encoded them using SoftBank's Private Use Area scheme. As part of a set of characters sourced from SoftBank, au by KDDI, and NTT Docomo emoji sets, the eggplant emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 under the name "Pistol". Global popularity of emojis then surged in the early to mid-2010s. The pistol emoji has been included in the Unicode Technical Standard for emoji (UTS #51) since its first edition (Emoji 1.0) in 2015.

Birger Sevaldson (born 1953, BÃ¦rum, Norway) is a founding member and current chairman of OCEAN Design Research Association and Professor at the Institute of Industrial Design at AHO - Oslo School of Architecture and Design where he collaborates with Michael Ulrich Hensel. He is an academic and designer working in a broad field of design and architecture. He has been in private practice since 1986. His practice spans from architecture interior to furniture and product design, design of lighting armatures and boat design. It also includes installations. Sevaldson has been developing concepts in design computing, digital creativity in design and architecture (Digital morphogenesis) and his doctoral thesis from 2005 is a summary of 15 years of research in this field. This research expanded into a wider interest in the design process and especially design processes for uncertainty, unforeseen futures and complexity. This research grew out of the digital research and initially engaged in time related design,  reformulating the design environment and resulted in an approach entitled Systems Oriented Design.

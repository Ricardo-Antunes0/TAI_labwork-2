The 1964 Dixmoor race riot, also known as the Dixmoor Outrage, was a racially motivated conflict in the United States that lasted for four days and resulted in the deaths of five white people and three black people. The events began on July 18, 1964, when white youths traveling in a caravan of cars burned down a black family's home on Dixmoor, a small rural community in eastern Kentucky. This event sparked a series of retaliatory attacks against black residents by groups of white residents. The violence escalated on July 23, when a group of whites attacked a black family living near the town of Greenville. The next day, white mobs burned down several black homes and businesses in the towns of Simpsonville and Mauldin. On July 27, white mobs attacked a group of black teenagers walking to a store in the town of Danville. Five people were killed and at least twenty were injured in what is now known as the Dixmoor race riot.

WWE 205 Live is a professional wrestling streaming television program that was produced by WWE. It premiered on November 29, 2016, and ended on February 11, 2022. The show aired exclusively on the WWE Network until March 2021 when the American version of the WWE Network merged under NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service; outside of the United States, the program still aired on the WWE Network. In the United States, the show aired on Friday nights at 10pm Eastern Time, immediately following WWE's flagship SmackDown program. The show was originally centered around cruiserweights, competitors billed at a maximum weight of 205 lbs., from the namesake 205 Live brand. In 2019, the show began featuring cruiserweight talent from the NXT and NXT UK brands, and by August 2021, also included female competitors as well as male competitors above the weight limit. The show had originally aired live as its name implied, although with some exceptions, but by 2020, 205 Live episodes were pre-taped on the Tuesday before its airing.

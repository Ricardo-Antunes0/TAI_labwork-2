Steve Conway originally came from Dublin, Ireland, and is best known as a broadcaster and writer, formerly of the offshore pirate station Radio Caroline, later on the Dublin indie rock station Phantom 105.2 and most recently 8Radio.com, an online station operated by Phantom founder Simon Maher. However, his main day job is within the I.T. industry and currently resides in County Westmeath in Ireland. Conway started his radio career on a small London rock-music pirate, South East Sound in 1985, before moving to Radio Caroline, where he rose to the positions of Head of News and Programme Controller (3). Initially, when he started for the first time on Radio Caroline, Steve's sole function was as a newsreader. In 1991 he was one of the final crew on board the Caroline ship Ross Revenge when it ran aground on the Goodwin Sands (2). In 1999, he returned to help relaunch Radio Caroline on satellite, moving home to Dublin and taking up a position the following year on Phantom, which at the time was a pirate. Steve had also involvement with at least two other pirates during the 1990s and the early 2000s - Radio Dublin and ABC Dublin. Steve Conway was Head of News during Phantom's two temporary license runs in 2003 and 2004. His main show on Phantom 105.2, when it was on a full-time license, was Random Access on Sunday evenings.

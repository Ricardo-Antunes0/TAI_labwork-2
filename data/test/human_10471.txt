Ruswarp village lies within the Scarborough borough of North Yorkshire, England. It is around  from Whitby, at the junction of the B1410 and B1416 roads, on the River Esk and the Esk Valley Line, with trains stopping at Ruswarp railway station. Originally it was called Risewarp (Old English hrÄ«s wearp, ) meaning 'silted land overgrown with brushwood'. The heritage steam train services from Pickering to Whitby pass through Ruswarp but do not stop at the Ruswarp platform. Bus services connect the village to the surrounding area. The village is served by local shops including a butcher and a bakery, as well as a grocery store further down the street. There is a pub, the Bridge Inn and a church, the Ruswarp Church of St Bartholomew. Primary education is catered for by a local Church of England primary school. There was a Post Office opposite the butcher, but that closed down several years ago after losing the franchise, and is now converted into a private residence.

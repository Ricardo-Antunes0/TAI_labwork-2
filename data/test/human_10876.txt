Professor John Alan Chalmers (29 September 1904 â€“ 14 March 1967) was a British atmospheric physicist based at Durham University. He is well known for his contributions to atmospheric electricity, particularly an internationally-respected textbook, and, outside his scientific work, for his involvement with Scouting. This led to him being widely known to his colleagues by the nickname, "Skip", a commonly used term for the leader of a Scout troop. Education and early life  John Alan Chalmers (known as Alan) was born in London in 1904 and won a scholarship to Highgate School. He had one brother, Bruce Chalmers (who later became a well-known metallurgist), and a sister, Marian. In 1923 he won an open scholarship to Queen's College Cambridge and graduated with a first class degree in Natural Sciences (Physics). He remained at Cambridge in the Cavendish Laboratory to study for a PhD, supervised by Rutherford. In 1928 he left Cambridge to take up a lectureship at Durham University. He received his PhD for a thesis entitled "Some problems in radioactivity" in 1930.

The 22nd Rifle Corps was a corps-level command of the Soviet Union's Red Army during World War II.  Formed in December 1941 from the 1st and 2nd Rifle Divisions and the 3rd Tank Division, the corps fought in the Western Front until its disbandment in May 1945. The corps was commanded by Major General A. S. Krivoruchko from October 1943 to May 1945.  The corps played a significant role in Operation Bagration, the Soviet Union's summer 1944 offensive into Belarus and Poland, and was later involved in Operation Poltava, the Red Army's 1944 invasion of Ukraine. After the war, it was disbanded in October 1945.

Franz Clemens Honoratus Hermann Josef Brentano (; 1813 – 1874) was a German philosopher and Brentano family patriarch who is considered one of the founders of Brentano's school of psychology. He is also known for his work on semantics, epistemology, ontology, and philosophy of language.  Franz Brentano was born on 10 December 1813 in the city of Graz in Austria-Hungary to Clemens Brentano, a physician and professor at the University of Graz, and Henriette Kühnel Brentano (née von Stein). Franz Brentano was the eldest of six children. In 1826, his father took him to Vienna to study medicine at the University of Vienna under Theodor Krämer. However, he soon became dissatisfied with the approach of Krämer and turned to philosophy.  In 1830, Franz Brentano submitted a thesis on Aristotle's philosophy to the University of Vienna. The thesis was accepted and he received his doctorate in 1832. He then returned to Graz, where he began teaching classes in philosophy at the university. In 1837 he became a full professor at the university and remained so until his death.  Franz Brentano is best known for his work on psychology. He is also credited with being one of the founders of modern semantics. His work on semantics has had a significant impact on philosophical discussions concerning meaning and language. He also made important contributions to epistemology, ontology, and philosophy of religion.  Franz

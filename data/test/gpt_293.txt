Coptotelia calidaria is a moth in the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Meyrick in 1904. It is found in Australia, where it has been recorded from New South Wales.  The wingspan is about 12Â mm. The forewings are light ochreous-yellow, sprinkled with black, the costal edge black towards the base and with a triangular black blotch on the costa near the base, as well as a small black discal dot at one-fourth, and an undefined fuscous dot near the disc beyond this. There is also an undefined suffused blackish streak along the fold from one-fourth to three-fourths, preceded by a minute white dot at two-thirds and terminated by another white dot at four-fifths. The hindwings are light grey.

Louis Rubidoux (1796â€“1868, born Louis Robidoux) was a French painter and engraver.  He was born in Paris on 1796, the son of a silk mercer. He began his training as an artist with his father, but soon became associated with Jean-Baptiste Regnault, who became his mentor. In 1819 he exhibited for the first time at the Salon, and in 1821 he was awarded the Legion of Honour "for his remarkable talent for painting historical subjects".   In 1825 he went to Rome, where he remained for four years. On his return to Paris he exhibited at the Salon for the last time in 1829. In 1830 he exhibited a painting entitled "The Death of Cleopatra" at the Royal Academy. This work created a sensation, and Rubidoux was immediately elected an associate member of the Academy. In 1835 he was made a full member of the Academy.   Rubidoux died on 13 January 1868.

Thamizhavel Go. Sarangapani, (, 19 April 1903 â€“ 16 March 1974) or Kosa as he was also known, a Tamil writer and publisher, was born in Thiruvarur, Tamil Nadu, on 20 April 1903.  He received a good education and was effectively bi-lingual in Tamil and English. At 21, he went to Singapore to work as a bookkeeper, eventually becoming the manager at his firm. Sarangapani was deeply influenced by E. V. Ramasami (better known as Periyar) and his Self-Respect Movement in Tamil Nadu. He was committed to rationalism and the ideal of a modern, progressive society. Sarangapani established direct contact with the Self-Respect Movement in India when he became the agent in British Malaya (then including Singapore) for the distribution of its magazine, Kudi Arasu. These links were strengthened in 1929 and 1954, when he helped to arrange Periyar's visits to Singapore and Malaya to spread his message to local Tamils.

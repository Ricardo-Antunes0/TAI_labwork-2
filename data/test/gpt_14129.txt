Lada class, Russian designation Project 677 Lada, was a class of nuclear-powered submarines operated by the Soviet Union.  The Lada class was the first nuclear-powered submarine design to be built in the Soviet Union. The submarines were designed by the Kiev Engineering Bureau in the early 1960s and entered service with the Soviet Navy in 1971. They were decommissioned from active service in the early 1990s and have since been replaced by the newer Akula-class submarines.  The Lada class was a relatively small submarine, measuring just over 100 metres (330 ft) long and displacing 2,000 tonnes (2,200 tons). They had a maximum surfaced speed of 25 knots (46 km/h; 29 mph) and could operate for up to six months at a time at depths of up to 400 metres (1,300 ft). The submarines were armed with six torpedo tubes and a number of anti-ship missiles.

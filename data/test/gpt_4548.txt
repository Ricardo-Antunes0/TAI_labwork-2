Božilak (in Macedonian Cyrillic: Божилак, 'Rainbow') is a Serbian pop singer and actor.  Božilak was born on September 24, 1986, in the town of Šabac, Serbia, to parents Dragana (née Jovanović) and Milutin Božilak. He has two younger brothers, Marko and Nikola. Božilak started singing at the age of five, and by the age of twelve he had started performing in local clubs. In 2001, he participated in the Serbian national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2001 with the song "Ljubavi je svuda", but failed to qualify. However, his debut album "Neka ti se ljubi" was released later that year and achieved moderate commercial success.   In 2003, Božilak released his second album "Priča o nebu i zemlji", which featured a more pop-oriented sound and more autobiographical lyrics. The album was less successful than his debut, however, and Božilak decided to take a break from music to focus on his education.   In 2009, Božilak returned with his third album "Dalje od srca". The album was more experimental than his previous work and featured collaborations with artists such as Dusko Onđelković and Zdravko Čolić. It was also more successful than his previous albums, peaking at number five on

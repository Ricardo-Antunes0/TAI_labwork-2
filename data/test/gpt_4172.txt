Ciro Wayne Mancuso (born 1949) was a Canadian-born American mobster and the boss of the Genovese crime family from 1986 to 1992. He is currently serving a life sentence for racketeering, murder and other crimes.  Mancuso was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to an Italian-American family. He began his criminal career as a street-level thief and later became involved in the drug trafficking business. In the early 1980s, he became involved in the prostitution and loan-sharking rackets and started to build his own criminal organization. In 1986, Mancuso was promoted to head of the Genovese crime family following the death of boss John Gotti. Mancuso was a shrewd operator and successfully managed to avoid major police investigations into his organization. However, his reign as head of the Genovese crime family was short-lived; he was arrested in 1992 and sentenced to life imprisonment.

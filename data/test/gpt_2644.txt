Ex parte Lundgren is a 2005 decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that held that a district court did not have jurisdiction over a claim brought by an individual challenging her exclusion from jury service in a civil trial because she had not been notified of the right to appeal her exclusion.  Lundgren was born in Sweden and moved to the United States in 1984. She was excluded from jury service in a civil trial because she had not been notified of the right to appeal her exclusion. The district court dismissed her claim, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the district court did have jurisdiction to hear her claim because she had exhausted her administrative remedies.

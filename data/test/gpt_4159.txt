Chinese mythological geography refers to the related myths, legends and stories about the geography of China. These myths and legends often depict different parts of China as home to different kinds of creatures, or as the site of important events in Chinese history.  Chinese mythological geography is often linked to the cosmography and mythology of other East Asian cultures, such as Korea and Japan. For instance, Mount Tai is known in Chinese mythology as the home of the god Taiyi, while Mount Wutai is known in Japanese mythology as the home of the god Shintoism's Kami. Similarly, the dragon gate at Beijing's Forbidden City is said to be the location where a dragon chased away the goddess Nuwa from heaven.  Chinese mythological geography has also been used to explain certain physical features of China, such as why the Great Wall stretches for so long. One explanation suggests that a monster called Chiyou was blocking the way to heaven for humans, and that the wall was built to eliminate this obstacle.

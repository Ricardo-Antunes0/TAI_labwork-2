Hiroshima mon amour , the literal English translation of the Japanese title, is a 1955 French film directed by Alain Resnais. It is based on the novel of the same name by Marguerite Duras.  The film tells the story of two people who are strangers who fall in love and are forced to confront the horrors of Hiroshima during the final days of World War II.  Hiroshima mon amour has been often cited as one of the greatest films ever made. It was awarded both the Palme d'Or and the Golden Lion at the 1955 Cannes Film Festival, and won nine other awards, including Best Director for Alain Resnais.  The film has been frequently re- screened, and was released on Blu-ray disc in May 2009.

Martin Gerard Rutten (22 October 1910 â€“ 8 May 1974) was a Dutch biologist and zoologist, especially noted for his work on the classification of invertebrates. Rutten was a founder of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).  Martin Gerard Rutten was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands on 22 October 1910. After receiving his undergraduate degree in biology from the University of Amsterdam in 1931, Rutten continued his studies at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, where he obtained his doctorate in 1938. Rutten then worked as a research associate at the University of Amsterdam until 1941, when he joined the faculty of biology at Utrecht University as a professor.  Rutten was a founder and first president of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), serving from its foundation in 1947 until his death in 1974. He also served as chairman of the Dutch Biological Society from 1951 to 1954, and was a member of numerous other scientific organizations. Rutten died on 8 May 1974 in Utrecht, Netherlands.  Martin Gerard Rutten's work in taxonomy is particularly notable. He developed the concept of ordinality, which is now widely used in classification schemes for invertebrates. Rutten also developed the Rutten system for the classification of annelids (a group including clams, snails, and earthworms), which is still used today. Rutten also made significant contributions to our understanding of reproduction in invertebrates,

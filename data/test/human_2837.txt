Banda Maguey (nickname: "La estrella de los bailes") is a Regional Mexican band from Jalisco, Mexico. They originated in Villa Corona, also the home of Banda Machos, who along with Banda Maguey have been called the two most successful exponents of the Technobanda sound.  Banda Maguey was led by their singer Ernesto Solano who has also composed a number of their songs, including Pero Te Amo, a hit from their fourth album, El Mundo Gira. In 1998, Banda Maguey signed a record deal with BMG U.S. Latin and recorded Lágrimas De Sangre. A favorite during the 1990s Technobanda craze, Banda Maguey took over the radio waves with their debut album Tumbando Caña in 1994, which contained a number of hits including "El Alacran" a cover originally sung by La Sonora Matancera. Signed to Fonovisa a year earlier, Banda Maguey took over their native town with their onda grupera style. In May 1994, the band performed live for the first time in the United States. In 1995, Banda Maguey released La Estrella De Los Bailes, which featured the singles Como La Luna, Si Tú No Estás, Que Sacrificio, and Eva Maria that climbed local charts.

The Cima Vallona ambush (Italian: Strage di Cima Vallona) was a double improvised explosive device attack on Italian security forces at  Cima Vallona, Provincia di Belluno. The ambush was carried out on 26 June 1967 by members of the South Tyrolean Liberation Committee, a paramilitary organization seeking the independence of German-speaking South Tyrol from Italy. The first explosion, involving the use of a landmine, struck a patrol of Alpini from the Italian Army, called in after the bombing of an electricity pylon. A second patrol, this time composed by Carabinieri, bore the full blast of a booby-trap while searching the area of the previous attack. One Alpini and three Carabinieri were killed, while a fourth Carabiniere survived with serious injuries. Background  The annexation of South Tyrol after WWI saw a large German-speaking population within the redrawn boundaries of Italy, in the newly established province of Belluno. The Fascist regime later began a process of Italianization of South Tyrol, which triggered the passive resistance of the local population. The good relations between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany resulted in the South Tyrol Option Agreement (1939), which gave the local residents the choice between emigration to Germany or full integration with Italy. A majority opted for Germany, but after a brief period of German occupation from 1943 to 1945, during WWII, most of the emigrants returned to Italy. Post-war relations between the German-speaking and the Italian communities proved tense, if not hostile, according to Giulio Andreotti, then president of the Italian Bureau of Border Issues.

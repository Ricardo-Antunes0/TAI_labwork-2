Thyra Godfrey Thomson (July 30, 1916 – June 11, 2013) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Wyoming, who served as a Republican as the Wyoming Secretary of State from 1963 to 1987. Background Thyra Godfrey Thomson was born on July 30, 1916 to John and Rose Godfrey in Florence, Colorado, the only girl in a family of seven. Her father, who was a mine superintendent for the Colorado Fuel and Iron Co., died in a mine explosion when she was three.  When she was in her teens, her mother brought her and her youngest brother to Cheyenne, Wyoming where she graduated from high school.  Thyra went on to earn a BA degree cum laude at the University of Wyoming in 1939, with a major in psychology and minors in sociology and business administration. On August 6, 1939, Thyra married  Edwin Keith Thomson from Newcastle who was working on his Juris Doctorate and managing the University of Wyoming Bookstore. Thyra received a President's citation for war work at home in Cheyenne while Keith became the youngest infantry battalion commander in the U.S. forces in WWII. Keith returned to Cheyenne in 1945, and he and Thyra became active in statewide politics.  In 1954, Keith was elected to Congress and moved Thyra and their three sons—William John, Bruce Godfrey, and Keith Coffey—to the nation's capitol.  After three terms in the U.S. house of Representatives, Keith was elected to the U.S. Senate in November 1960, and on December 9, died of a heart attack at the age of 41.

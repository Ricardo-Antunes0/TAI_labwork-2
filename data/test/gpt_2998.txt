Ludwig Hofmann (14 January 1895 in Frankfurt – 10 May 1985 in Frankfurt) was a German bass player. He is best known for his work with the Django Reinhardt Quintet.  Hofmann was born in Frankfurt, Germany, to a musical family. His father, Franz Hofmann, was a violinist and teacher who later became a music critic. Hofmann began his musical studies at the age of six with his father, and later studied violin with Max Seiffert and composition with Heinrich Schütz.  In 1916, Hofmann joined the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra as a member of their string section. The following year, he moved to Paris to join the Django Reinhardt Quintet, for which he played bass for over twenty years. He also played with other notable jazz bands such as the Billy Eckstine Sextet and Artie Shaw's Five Spot Orchestra. In 1954, Hofmann retired from playing music full-time and returned to Frankfurt, where he died ten years later.

The group recorded over thirty albums during their tenure together and toured extensively around the world.

Actinoporus elegans, commonly known as the elegant worm, is a species of nematode in the family Radophilidae.   Elegant worm nematodes are slender, elongated nematodes with smooth, shiny skin. They are usually white or cream-colored, but may be yellow or reddish brown, and have a characteristic greenish or bluish sheen. They measure up to 25 mm in length and have a uniform width of about 2 mm. There are about 130 described species of elegant worm.   Elegant worm nematodes occur in all continents except Antarctica, but are most common in temperate zones. They live in moist soils, and are commonly found near water sources such as ponds or rivers. They feed on soil invertebrates, but can also survive on a vegetarian diet.

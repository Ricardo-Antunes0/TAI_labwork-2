cDVD discs, also known as mini-DVD discs, are optical discs that have a diameter of 12 cm and a thickness of 1.2 cm. They are used for storing digital audio and video content, and are similar to DVDs in appearance and use, but can store up to 4.7 GB of data rather than 2.4 GB on a regular DVD.  cdvd was created as an optical disc format to supersede the then-current DVD format. cDVD discs use the same dimensions as regular DVDs, but have a thinner layer of plastic that allows for more data to be stored on each disc. The first cDVD players were released in late 2002, and by 2004 over 100 million players had been sold worldwide.  cDVD is not backward compatible with regular DVDs; in order to play a cDVD disc on a regular DVD player, the user must first convert the cDVD using an appropriate player.

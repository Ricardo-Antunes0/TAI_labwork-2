In Christian theology, conditionalism or conditional immortality is the belief that humans will be rewarded or punished in an afterlife based on their actions or beliefs in this life. It is contrasted with universalism, which holds that all humans will be rewarded or punished in the same way regardless of their actions or beliefs in this life.  Conditionalism is based on a number of biblical texts, including the Gospel of Matthew, in which Jesus says "If you love me, keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth" (14:15). In conditionalism, this promise is seen as a conditional one - that is, it applies only to those who keep Jesus' commandments. For those who do not keep them, there is no promise of salvation.  The concept of conditional immortality has been debated by theologians throughout history. Some have seen it as a way of reconciling the idea of an afterlife with the idea of human depravity; others have seen it as a way of reconciling the idea of an afterlife with the idea of human free will.

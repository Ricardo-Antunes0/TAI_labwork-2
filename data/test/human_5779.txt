Change Colours is the third studio album by British-Australian recording artist Reece Mastin, released on 9 October 2015 by Social Family Records. It is the first studio album released by Mastin since leaving Sony Music Australia, and the follow-up to his 2015 extended play Rebel and the Reason. The album is described as a rock album "high on raw feelings, with songs ripped straight out of real-life experiences that cut to the heart of the matter". It was announced and became available for pre-order on 11 September 2015. Content and themes Several songs on the album are about Mastin's split with Home and Away actress Rhiannon Fish, which, according to Mastin, was less than amicable. Mastin claims "there was a lot of arguing" but they ended on "good terms". Mastin states he wrestled with being so honest on the record but writing about how he felt proved to be "therapeutic". The album also documents anxiety and depression, with Mastin noting severing ties with Sony Music Australia and the 2014 Lindt chocolate café hostage crisis as having an impact on him.

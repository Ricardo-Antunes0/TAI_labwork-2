The Bannock War of 1878 was an armed conflict between the U.S. military, and Bannock and Paiute warriors in Idaho and Northeastern Oregon from June to August 1878. The Bannock totaled about 600 to 800 in 1870 because of other Soshonean peoples being included with Bannock numbers; they were led by Chief Buffalo Horn, who was killed in action on June 8, 1878. After his death, Chief Egan led the Bannocks. He and some of his warriors were killed in July, by a Umatilla party that entered his camp in subterfuge. The U.S. military, consisting of the 21st Infantry Regiment and volunteers, was led by Brigadier General Oliver O. Howard. Nearby states also sent militias to the region. The conflict ended in August and September 1878, when the remaining scattered Bannock-Paiute forces surrendered; many returned to Fort Hall Reservation. The US Army forced some 543 Paiute from Nevada and Oregon and Bannock prisoners to be interned at Yakama Indian Reservation, in southeastern Washington Territory.

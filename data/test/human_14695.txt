Feng Dao  (882-May 21, 954), courtesy name Kedao , formally Prince Wenyi of Ying , was a Chinese inventor, printer, and politician. He was an important Chinese governmental official during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, who served as a chancellor during the three of the latter four dynasties (Later Tang, Later Jin, and Later Zhou) and was also an honored official during Later Han.  For his contribution to improving block-printing process for printing Chinese written works, scholars have compared him to the German inventor and blacksmith Johannes Gutenberg.  Traditional histories praised him for his various virtues but also vilified him for not being faithful to a single dynasty but being willing to serve a number of successive dynasties (see Ouyang Xiu and Sima Guang below). Feng Dao is depicted in the Wu Shuang Pu (無雙譜, Table of Peerless Heroes) by Jin Guliang. Background and service during Yan  Feng Dao was born in 882, during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang.  His family was from Jingcheng (景城, in modern Cangzhou, Hebei).  His ancestors had been alternatively farmers and scholars.  Feng Dao himself was said to be virtuous and tolerant in his youth, studious and capable in writing.  He did not look down on poor clothes or food, and was willing to endure hard labor to support his parents and live in poverty.  At some point, he was invited by Liu Shouguang, one of the major late-Tang warlords, to serve as a secretary at the prefectural government of Liu's capital You Prefecture (幽州, in modern Beijing).

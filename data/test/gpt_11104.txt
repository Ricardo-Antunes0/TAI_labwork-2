The Curtiss P-40 Warhawk is an American single-seat fighter aircraft that was used by the United States, United Kingdom and many other countries during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War.  The Warhawk was designed in 1938 by Curtiss-Wright and first flew in March 1940. It saw combat from 1941 to 1945 and was used by many Allied air forces, most notably the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and Royal Air Force (RAF). The Warhawk is considered to be one of the most successful aircraft of World War II, with over 2,000 aircraft built. In addition, it served in several conflicts after the war, including the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and the Gulf War of 1990â€“91. The Warhawk remains in service with some air forces today.

The Nevada presidential caucuses were an electoral event in which citizensÂ met in precinct caucuses to elect delegates to the corresponding county conventions. The 2020 Nevada caucuses were the last held in the state before the state legislature signed a law which abolished the Nevada Caucus and replaced it with a Primary. There are 17 counties in Nevada and so there are 17 conventions. The county conventions then select delegates to Nevada's State Convention, which then choose delegates for the presidential nominating conventions. The Nevada caucuses began in 1981. The Kerry/Dean caucus was held on February 14, 2004.  In 2008 the DNC gave Nevada the official first in the west status reflecting the growing importance of the West as well as Nevada's electoral bellwether status. In 2012, the Nevada caucuses were the third major electoral event in the nominating process for President of the United States.  In 2016, the Democratic caucus was held on February 20 and the Republican caucus was held on February 23.

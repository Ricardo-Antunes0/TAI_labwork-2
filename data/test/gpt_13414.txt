Romestecq is an historical Dutch card game that is played with a deck of 32 cards. The object of the game is to score points by playing cards to create combinations, and by taking points from the player to the left of the dealer.  Romestecq is a relatively new game that was first developed in the 1990s. It has since become popular in Europe, and is also gaining popularity in North America. Romestecq is similar to other card games, such as bridge and poker, but has a different set of rules.  One of the unique features of Romestecq is that it is played with a deck of 32 cards. This makes it possible to create more combinations than with other card games. This can be helpful if you want to create a high-scoring combination, or if you want to take points away from your opponent.  Another unique feature of Romestecq is that it is played with a dealer. This means that the player to the left of the dealer (the dealer's left) is always the player who deals first. This can be helpful if you want to move your cards around before playing them, or if you want to control the flow of the game.  Romestecq can be a challenging game, but it is also fun and entertaining.

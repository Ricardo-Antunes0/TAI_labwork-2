Crys (Welsh word for Shirt) are a Welsh heavy rock/metal band from Resolven, South Wales. The band was formed in 1976 by the  brothers Liam Forde (vocals, rhythm guitar) Scott Forde (bass guitar); and Alun Morgan (lead guitar) while attending boarding school in Hereford, England. They were originally named 'Salic Law' and performed at numerous pubs and clubs in the South Wales area. Early days Crys were offered a deal to record a single if they agreed to put Welsh lyrics to their existing songs (which had previously been performed in English). The band complied and the resulting single "Cadw Symud / Lan yn y Gogledd" was released in 1980 on Click Records. The single featured Verden Allen (Mott the Hoople) on keyboards and was recorded at Pete King's studio in Swansea. The line-up by this time was completed by Nicky Samuel (drums). 'Crys' is a Welsh word that translates into 'Shirt' in English.

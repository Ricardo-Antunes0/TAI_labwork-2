The Rechna Doab, or Rachna Doab (in Hindi: राचना दोब), is a long and narrow region in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. It comprises the area between the rivers Jhelum and Chenab, including the districts of Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh.  The Rechna Doab is a region of great strategic importance because it connects India to Tibet and Xinjiang. It also helps connect the Kashmir Valley with the rest of India. The region is also rich in mineral resources, including coal, iron ore, and copper.

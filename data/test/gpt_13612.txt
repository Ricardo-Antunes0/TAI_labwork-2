Categorical grants, also called conditional grants, are a type of grant that provides funding to a specific group or category of recipients. The recipients must meet certain eligibility criteria, which may include, but is not limited to, income levels, residency status, or population density.  Categorical grants are often used to support social welfare programs, such as welfare and food stamps, or public health initiatives. They can also be used to promote economic development, such as through funding for businesses in a certain area.  Categorical grants are typically more cost-effective than other types of grants because the government does not have to expend resources on screening each application. This allows for more money to be allocated to the program overall.

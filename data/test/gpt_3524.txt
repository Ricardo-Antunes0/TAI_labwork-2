Publius Licinius Cornelius Saloninus Valerianus ( â€“ 275) was Roman Emperor from 275 to 276. He was the last emperor of the Flavian dynasty.  Saloninus was born in Rome to Licinius Cornelius Saloninus and his wife, Valeria Maximilla. He had one older brother, Constantine II. At an early age, Saloninus was sent to Constantinople to be educated in the ways of government by his uncle, the Emperor Galerius. While there, Saloninus reportedly participated in many court intrigues and became friends with Licinius's son, Constantine II.  When Licinius died on 27 May 276, Constantine II succeeded him as emperor. The new emperor quickly came into conflict with Maxentius, the son of Maximian, who had been declared co-emperor by his father on 17 May. Constantine marched on Rome with an army and forced Maxentius to abdicate on 12 June. Two days later, he elevated Saloninus to the rank of Augustus and gave him the title of "Princeps Augusti".  Saloninus continued to administer the newly acquired territories with moderation. In July 277, he embarked on a tour of Britain, where he founded several important cities such as Verulamium and Canterbury. On his return trip, he was attacked by pirates at the mouth of the Rhine but was able to defeat them. In 278, he invaded northern Africa but was forced to retreat after suffering a crushing defeat at the Battle of Tricamarum.

Paul Ezra Rhoades (January 18, 1957 â€“ November 18, 2011) was an American spree killer and suspected serial killer convicted of three murders committed in Idaho during a three-week crime spree in 1987. He is the prime suspect in at least four additional killings in Utah and Wyoming dating back to 1984, however, he was never conclusively linked to these murders. He was executed for two of his confirmed murders in 2011, becoming the first person to be executed in Idaho in over seventeen years. Early life Paul Ezra Rhoades was born on January 18, 1957, in Idaho Falls, Idaho, the first of four children born to Augustus and Teresa Rhoades. His early life proved turbulent, as Rhoades was struck with polio since the age of 4, for which he constantly had to be hospitalized, and at home, his parents constantly argued. At the age of 10, he began drinking and soon dropped out of high school, after which he started using various drugs. Because of this, Rhoades developed an addiction to methamphetamines which would persist up until his arrest. To provide for his family, he took on various odd jobs both in Idaho and the surrounding states, specializing in sheetrocking. At the same time, however, he started breaking into various homes and stole any valuables he could find.

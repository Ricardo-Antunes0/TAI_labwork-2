An epitome (; , from ἐπιτέμνειν epitemnein, "to bring together, collect, enumerate") is a concise, full, or complete exposition or summary of a subject.  Epitomes are often used in writing, especially when the full work would be too lengthy or unwieldy to be published in its entirety. They can also be found in textbooks and other instructional works. A literal translation might be "a putting together" or "a gathering together".

Starting from July 2019 numerous approved and unapproved protests took place in Moscow, Russia. The protests were started by Alexei Navalny, a Russian opposition politician, who called for an unauthorized march on July 9th. The protests grew larger and more widespread with the help of social media platforms.      The protests mainly focused on corruption and Putin's rule, with some calling for the president to step down. Despite various arrests and police crackdowns, the protests continued until the fall of 2019.

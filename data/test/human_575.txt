Pure John Gorka is a "best of" collection of John Gorka's work selected from the five albums Gorka released on the Windham Hill/High Street label between 1990 and 1996.  This collection was released on June 27, 2006, by Windham Hill (now owned by Sony/BMG and distributed by Legacy Recordings) as part of a series of "Pure" albums by former Windham Hill artists; other titles cover the careers of diverse musicians such as Jim Brickman, Mark Isham, Shadowfax, Tuck & Patti, and Will Ackerman. Gorka says he didn't know anything about this release until he got a call from the copyright department of Sony/BMG: "I called them back and said, 'I have a record coming out?' I found out the story behind it, they're putting out a series from Windham Hill artists." Dawn Atkinson, producer of two of Gorka's albums, selected the songs.  "It's hard to describe as a greatest hits thing," says Gorka, "The songs were picked to make a good record upon itself. A best-of, with my favorite songs, that would not make a good record to listen to. My favorites would be too slow." Although the collection offers no new recordings to owners of Gorka's complete back catalog, others will find a few "gems" from many of his earlier albums, many of which are no longer in print.  These tracks also feature many of the collaborations Gorka has enjoyed over the years.  Backing vocalist include Shawn Colvin, Lucy Kaplansky, Nanci Griffith, Jennifer Kimball, and Cliff Eberhardt.

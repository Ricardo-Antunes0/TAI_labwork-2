The village has a large population of Greek Thracians (Θρακιωτες) from the area of Eastern Thrace, or Eastern Romylia as it also known. A majority emigrated to Pedino from the villages Neo Gennikio, Aivali, Alepli & Koumbourlari, Eastern Thrace. The exact location of the villages in Turkey is not known but they are close to Saranta Ekklisies (Σαράντα Εκκλησίες, Kırklareli in Turkish). The new village was established by refugees, mostly as part of the Population Exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923 Exchange of Greek Orthodox and Muslim Populations, in addition to any refugees fleeing Turkish persecution after the 1922 Greek military campaign in Asia Minor.

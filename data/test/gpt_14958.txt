The unseen species problem is commonly referred to as the biodiversity crisis. The term was first coined in the early 1990s by Paul Ehrlich and Stephen Schneider, who argued that the increase in human population and activity was causing the extinction of many plant and animal species that were not seen or monitored by humans. The problem has since been recognized by other scientists as well, and has been described as one of the most pressing concerns facing the world today.  The problem of the unseen species is twofold. First, there are many species of plants and animals that are not seen or monitored by humans, which makes it difficult to determine their numbers and status. Second, many species that are seen or monitored by humans are in danger of extinction because of human activities, such as deforestation, poaching, hunting, and habitat destruction. If left unchecked, the problem of the unseen species could lead to the extinction of many species of plants and animals around the world.

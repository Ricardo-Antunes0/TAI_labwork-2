IMG, in computing, refers to binary files containing images, sometimes with associated metadata. They are often used to store graphics or icons used in applications and on websites. The name "IMG" is a portmanteau of "image" and "GIF".  An IMG file stores an image as a sequence of bytes, each of which corresponds to a pixel in the image. Images can be in any color depth, but most commonly they are represented as 8-bit grayscale images. Image formats that use IMG files include GIF, JPG, PNG, and BMP.  The main advantages of IMG files are their low storage requirements and their ability to store multiple versions of an image without having to recompress them. Another advantage is that images can be embedded in other files, making them a useful format for distributing software applications and for delivering web pages.

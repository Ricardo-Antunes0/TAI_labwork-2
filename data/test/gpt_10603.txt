The North Caucasus , or Ciscaucasia , is a geographical region in southern Russia and northern Syria. The region is bounded by the Black and Caspian seas to the east, the Caucasus Mountains to the north, and the Anatolian plateau to the west.  The North Caucasus region is home to a diverse population including Armenians, Azeris, Circassians, Chechens, Ingush, Karachays, Lezgins, Meskhetian Turks, Ossetians, Tats, Urals and others. The economic mecca of Russia's North Caucasus region is Vladivostok.  The North Caucasus region has been the scene of numerous conflicts throughout its history. The Russian Revolution of 1917 and subsequent Civil War pitted Bolshevik Reds against White counter-revolutionaries in the region. During World War II, the North Caucasus was invaded by Nazi Germany and its allies. The region saw extensive combat as Soviet and German forces fought for control of strategic positions. In 1991, during the Russian Civil War, Chechen separatists attempted to secede from Russia, leading to a three-year conflict that ended in a Russian victory.

Novelty piano is a genre of piano music that is distinguished by its unusual or quirky sounds.  The novelty piano genre emerged in the early 20th century, as a way to experiment with new sounds and musical styles. Initially, novelty pianos were used mainly in nightclubs and other entertainment venues, but later they became popular among amateur pianists as well.  Some of the most famous novelty pianos include the Moog synthesizer, the Yamaha DX7, and the Korg MS-20. Today, novelty pianos are still used to create new sounds and textures, and they are often used in jazz and electronica music genres.

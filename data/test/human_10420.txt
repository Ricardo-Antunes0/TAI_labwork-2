Paint Drying is a 2016 British feature film directed and produced by Charlie Lyne. The film is about paint on a wall drying, lasting for ten hours and seven minutes. The film was created by Charlie Lyne in order to force the British Board of Film Classification (B.B.F.C.) to watch all ten hours to give the film an age rating classification, as a protest against censorship and the prohibitive cost to independent film-makers (usually £1000 per film) which the B.B.F.C. classification requirement imposes. Overview  The B.B.F.C. charged a flat £101.50 fee per film, plus a £7.09 per minute fee, to classify a film. Hence the more money committed to the project, the longer the submitted film could be. Charlie Lyne started a Kickstarter page in order to raise money to make the film as long as possible. He had filmed fourteen hours of paint drying on a wall in advance, in case he raised enough money to show all the footage. Lyne raised more than £5,936 from 686 backers. The film was released on 26 January 2016 with the run-time of ten hours and seven minutes. The BBFC gave the film a U rating, indicating it is suitable for all ages.

It is the only extant member of the genus Iguana and is the most widely distributed lizard in the Americas. The green iguana is the national reptile of Nicaragua.  The green iguana is a heavy-bodied reptile with a long snout and a wide head. The body is covered in smooth, scaly skin that ranges from green to brown, occasionally with black patches. The iguana's limbs are short and stocky, and its feet have four toes. The green iguana has a long tail that it uses to balance when walking or running.  The green iguana feeds mainly on plants, but will also consume small animals. It breeds from April to October, and females lay up to 12 eggs per clutch.

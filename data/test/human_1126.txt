The Madonna of the Rabbit, The Aldobrandini Madonna, The Virgin and Child with the Infant Saint John and a Female Saint or Donor or The Virgin and Child with the Infant Saint John and Saint Catherine is an oil on canvas painting by Titian dating to around 1530 and now held in the National Gallery in London. There are studio copies in the Galleria Palatina in Florence and in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Frizzoni proposed identifying this Madonna with the one mentioned in 1532 by Marcantonio Michiel in the Venetian house of Andrea Odoni (subject of a portrait by Lotto), while Tietze thought it was one of three paintings commissioned from Titian by Federico Gonzaga in 1530. It was in the sacristy of the Escorial Monastery before coming to Paris in the 19th century. It then passed through the Baeucousin and Coesvelt collections before being purchased by its present owner in 1860.

The Memphis sanitation strike began on February 12, 1968, when sanitation workers walked off their jobs in Memphis, Tennessee, to demand better working conditions and pay. The strike lasted 47 days and ended on March 12. The strikers won several concessions from the city government, including a raise in the workers' wages and improved working conditions.

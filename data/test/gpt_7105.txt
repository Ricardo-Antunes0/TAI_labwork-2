{{Speciesbox  | taxon = Gloydius intermedius  | image = Gloydius intermedius.jpg  The Gloydius intermedius is a species of parasitic wasp in the family Apidae. It is found in North America.   This species is a solitary parasite that parasitizes the larvae of the paper wasp, Polistes dominulus. The Gloydius intermedius wasp enters the larva's body through a natural opening and lays an egg on the host's stomach. Once the egg hatches, the larva eats its way out, and the Gloydius intermedius wasp emerges to begin its life as a parasite.

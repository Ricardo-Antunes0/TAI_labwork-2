Richard Sale (4 October 1919 â€“ 3 February 1987) was an English schoolmaster and cricketer who played  for Warwickshire between 1939 and 1947 and for Derbyshire between 1949 and 1954. Sale was born in Atcham, Shropshire, the son of Richard Sale who had also played cricket for Derbyshire. He was educated at Repton School and Oriel College, Oxford, and played for Oxford University in 1939 opening the batting in the University Match against Cambridge University, which Oxford won. In the same year he made his debut for Warwickshire in a match in which the only play was his opening partnership. The Second World War interrupted his academic and playing career, as he was commissioned in the King's Shropshire Light Infantry and served in Canada and Normandy. In 1946 he played again for Oxford University, and again Oxford won the Varsity match. He then finished the season playing for Warwickshire.

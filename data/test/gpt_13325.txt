DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting - Handheld) is a specification for a high-definition terrestrial digital television broadcast standard. It is based on DVB-T2 and allows for transmission of up to 1080i high-definition video and 8 or 10 audio channels over single- and multi-carrier frequencies using OFDM modulation.  DVB-H was initially planned to be released in late 2007, but was delayed until early 2008. It was first shown off at the International Telecommunication Union's World Radiocommunication Conference in Geneva, Switzerland in May 2008.  DVB-H is intended to replace DVB-T2 as the main terrestrial digital television broadcast standard. DVB-H offers a number of benefits, including increased resolution and framerate, the ability to transmit more channels, and support for new media services such as VoD and live streaming.  In June 2009, the DVB Working Group announced that it had reached an agreement with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) on a compatible DVB-H Standard for terrestrial digital broadcasting in Europe. The agreement was ratified by the EBU's Council in November 2009.  In March 2010, the DVB Working Group announced that it had reached an agreement with the Asia Broadcast Satellite Organization (ABS) on a compatible DVB-H Standard for terrestrial digital broadcasting in Asia. The agreement was ratified by the ABS' Council in November 2010.  DVB-H is currently being developed by the DVB WG within the ITU

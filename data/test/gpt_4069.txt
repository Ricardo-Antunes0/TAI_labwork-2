Colette Mathur, a French writer and Indologist, was born on 9 September 1922 in Moulins, Allier. She was married to the French Indologist and professor at the University of Paris, André Malraux from 1943 to his death in 1969.  Mathur's early writings were devoted to her husband's work as an Indologist and she collaborated with him on several translations of Sanskrit texts. However, it was her novel L'Envers de la beauté (1966; The Reverse of Beauty), which made her name known to a wider audience. The novel tells the story of Mona, a young woman who yearns for a more spiritual life but is constrained by the materialism of her society and her own inner struggles.  Colette Mathur died on 15 December 1999 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

The Bay–Biñan Transmission Line (abbreviated as 8LI1BIN-BYZ, 8LI2BIN-BYZ) is a 230,000 volt, double-circuit transmission line in Calabarzon, Philippines that connects Bay and Biñan substations of National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP). Route description The Bay–Biñan Transmission Line passes through the provinces of Laguna, Batangas, and Cavite. The original transmission line was commissioned by government-owned National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR). Transmission structures used on the current line, however, were commissioned by National Transmission Corporation (TransCo). Since January 15, 2009, the privately-owned National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) operates and maintains the transmission line. It is located within the service area of NGCP's South Luzon Operations and Maintenance (SLOM) Districts 1 (South Western Tagalog) and 2 (South Eastern Tagalog). The current power line was completed on March 28, 2009 with the completion of the transmission line segment from steel pole 50 in Calamba to Biñan substation as part of Batangas Transmission Reinforcement Project (BTRP). Lattice towers used on the Calamba–Biñan segment of the original transmission line, however, are still present despite that it is now abandoned upon the completion of the current line.

AIDS, also known as Aids Info Disk and HIV AIDS, is a deadly virus that can cause AIDS. It is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). AIDS is a debilitating and often deadly illness. There is no cure for AIDS, but there are treatments available that can prolong a person's life.  AIDS was first identified in 1981. It was first named "gay-related immune deficiency syndrome" because it was most commonly found in men who have sex with men (MSM). Since then, the virus has become more common and affects people of all races and backgrounds. In 2010, it was estimated that 1.2 million people were living with AIDS worldwide. AIDS remains the deadliest epidemic in the world.

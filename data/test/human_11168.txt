Cofachique (pronounced ko-fa-chee) is a ghost town situated along the Neosho River near the present-day city of Iola in Allen County, Kansas, United States.  Being the first town established in Allen County in 1855, it was the original county seat.  However, within five years the greater part of the town was moved to the new town of Iola, while the old site of Cofachique became farm land.  The town was named in honor of an Osage chief known as Cofachique, who is said to have been particularly helpful to early settlers, bringing aid to the distressed and homeless. The name "Cofachique" appears to have origins with the Cofachiqui (or Cofitachiqui) tribe in South Carolina, who were Siouan speakers, and the Osage who settled this area were closely affiliated with the Siouan. History In the spring of 1855 a party of pro-slavery men from Fort Scott formed a town company and laid out a town on the high land east of the Neosho River, south of the mouth of Elm Creek, and about on the north line of Section 10, Township 25 south, Range 18 east.  The first Territorial Legislature in July, 1855, passed an act incorporating the Cofachique Town Association.  The legislature empowered the Association to locate and hold a tract of land not to exceed nine hundred acres, around the proposed town site, and passed an act making Cofachique the permanent county seat of Allen County.  The incorporators were Daniel Woodson, Charles Passmore, James S. Barbee, Samuel A. Williams, and Joseph C. Anderson; Mr. Barbee was elected the first president of the company.  During the summer of 1855 the town was located and staked out with Mr. Barbee as the first to settle on the new town site.  He was appointed the County Clerk at the first meeting of the county commissioners on May 7, 1856.

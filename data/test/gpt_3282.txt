The Proboscidea (, from the Greek  "probos" meaning 'forward' and "skide", meaning 'foot') is an extinct order of mammals that includes the elephant, mastodon, and mammoth. They were the largest terrestrial animals to ever live on Earth, reaching up to 30 metres in height at the shoulder and weighing up to 30 tonnes.  The Proboscidea were among the most successful of all mammalian orders, with over 20 genera and more than 100 species known from fossils. They ranged in North America, Europe, Asia and Africa during the late Paleocene and early Eocene epochs, but by the end of the Eocene they had become extinct.

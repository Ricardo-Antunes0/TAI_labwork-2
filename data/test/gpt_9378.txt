Education has played a central role in Islam since its inception. Islamic scripture, the Koran, places a high value on education and encourages Muslims to seek knowledge. Islamic schools, known as madrassas, have been key parts of Muslim societies since the Middle Ages. Islam also recognizes the value of formal education and encourages tolerance of different schools of thought.  Islamic schools typically teach the Quran and the Hadith, or sayings of Muhammad. Islamic schools also teach Arabic grammar, Islamic philosophy, and Islamic theology. Religious instruction is mandatory for all students in an Islamic school. In recent years, many Islamic schools have introduced scientific, mathematical, and technological curriculums into their programs.  Islamic education has been criticized for its emphasis on memorization over critical thinking, its promotion of religious extremism, and its negative impact on girls' education. Nevertheless, Islamic education remains an important part of Muslim societies around the world.

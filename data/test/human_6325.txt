On April 18, 2015, Blitzen Trapper released Live Harvest for Record Store Day.  Recorded on October 17 at the Doug Fir Lounge in Portland, Oregon at the end of the band's VII tour, Live Harvest is a song-for-song interpretation of Neil Young's 1972 album Harvest. The album was released as a 180 gram vinyl LP with a download card.  The band launched a short tour in support of the record, including stops at several City Winery locations in New York, Nashville, and Chicago, in which they played Harvest in its entirety, as well as Blitzen Trapper songs. Blitzen Trapper's interest in Neil Young goes back before the band's inception: ""All of us have disparate tastes which comes out in our own stuff, but Neil Young is a common thread that’s run through all of our lives," bassist Michael Van Pelt stated, "I remember listening to Harvest on cassette in Eric’s mom’s car back in high school ... It’s a special record, and it gets pretty dark in spots, too. Darker than I remember."  Lead singer Eric Earley elaborated, "I think we all knew the record before we even tried to play it. It’s one of those records that takes us to that place of comfort and nostalgia like The Dukes Of Hazzard or a Chevy Impala. It just feels good to play it."

"Someday We'll Know" is a song by the New Radicals. It was released in March 1999 as the second single off their album Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too (1998). Lyrically, the song explores the confusion over why a relationship ended. The group dissolved before the single's release, and as a result the song failed to match the success of the preceding single, "You Get What You Give", which had topped the charts in New Zealand and Canada and peaked within the top 5 in the United Kingdom. In contrast, "Someday We'll Know" became a top 40 hit only in Brazil where it made Number 38, and failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. The song is the group's second and final single, and has been covered by numerous artists, including Mandy Moore & Jon Foreman of Switchfoot and Hall & Oates. Composition  The song is a midtempo ballad in which Alexander reflects on a past relationship and wonders why his girlfriend left him, eventually concluding that someday he'll know the answer. Rolling Stone called the song "reflective," while Consequence of Sound commented that the song is "relatable to the ever-been-broken-hearted with lines like 'I’m speeding by the place that I met you for the 97th time tonight' and 'If I could ask God just one question: Why aren’t you here with me tonight?”

G 196-3 is a young low-mass M dwarf star. It is located about 160 light-years away in the constellation Hercules.  G 196-3 is a young low-mass M dwarf star, located about 160 light-years away in the constellation Hercules. It is considered to be a promising target for future observations due to its relatively low mass and proximity to Earth.  G 196-3 was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009 and has been studied using both ground- and space-based telescopes. Results from these observations suggest that the star may be surrounded by a circumstellar disk of dust and gas, which could potentially be used as a source of raw materials for advanced civilizations.

Saturnino López Novoa (29 November 1830 - 12 March 1905) was a Spanish Roman Catholic priest and the co-founder of the Hermanitas de los Ancianos Desamparados that he established with Saint Teresa de Jesús Jornet e Ibars. He lived with his aunt since his childhood and after he was ordained as a priest served his uncle who had been appointed as a bishop for the Huesca diocese. Novoa served his uncle as his aide until the latter died in Rome during the First Vatican Council at which Novoa served as his uncle's theological consultant. He continued to minister to the poor and ill following his uncle's death and set out establishing new houses and facilities for his religious congregation. Novoa's beatification process had been called for since his death since the people in Huesca and Barbastro came to revere him as a saint. The process was not launched until the 1990s when he became titled as a Servant of God. The cause culminated in mid-2014 after Pope Francis recognized his heroic virtue and titled him as Venerable.

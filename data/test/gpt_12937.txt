Sphingosine kinase (SphK) is a conserved lipid kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a sphingosine molecule from a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor to an activated protein kinase. SphK is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the heart, brain, and testes.  Sphingosine kinases are important regulators of cell signaling pathways. SphK is involved in the regulation of many downstream signaling molecules, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), phosphoinositides 3-kinases (PI3Ks), and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). SphK activation has been shown to promote cell proliferation and survival, as well as cell motility.

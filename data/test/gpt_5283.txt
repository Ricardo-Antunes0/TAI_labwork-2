The Scranton general strike was a widespread labor strike that took place in Scranton, Pennsylvania, United States on August 16, 1934. The strike was one of the largest in Pennsylvania history, involving more than 50,000 workers. The strike was eventually resolved without any major incidents.  The strike was precipitated by a dispute over the use of scab labor. Scranton was one of the most industrial cities in the United States, and its economy was heavily dependent on the production of coal and steel. The city's unionized workforce consisted largely of skilled workers who were able to negotiate high wages and benefits.  The strike began with a protest march by union members on August 15. The next day, the union called a general strike which quickly spread to other parts of the city. Businesses quickly shut down, and transportation became difficult to find. The strike continued for weeks with little resolution in sight.  On September 1, the union and the city agreed to a settlement which included a reduction in wages and benefits and the hiring of scab labor. The strike ended two weeks later with no major incidents.

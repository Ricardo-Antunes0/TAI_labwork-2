Évry Cathedral (; "Évry Cathedral of the Resurrection") is a Roman Catholic church located in the new town of Évry (Essonne), France. The cathedral was designed by Swiss architect Mario Botta. It opened in 1995 and was consecrated and dedicated to Saint Corbinian in 1996. It is the only cathedral begun and completed in France in the 20th century. History Évry is located in the suburbs of Paris, in the new town of Corbeil-Essonnes, which has a large majority immigrant population.   The diocese was created in 1966, and the parish church of Saint-Spire was elevated to the status of the bishop's seat as Corbeil Cathedral, but neither it nor any other existing church was suitable in size and location, and the bishop's offices were in a converted primary school. Évry was the natural centre of the area and population of the new diocese and was accordingly chosen as the episcopal centre, but lacked a suitable significant structure.

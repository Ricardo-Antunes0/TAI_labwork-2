Partner relationship management (PRM), used especially in the business world, is a process used to manage the relationships between two or more organizations. PRM may involve the development of policies, procedures, and goals to achieve desired outcomes in the relationship.  PRM can be used to improve communication and understanding within an organization, and can help prevent conflicts from arising. It can also promote collaboration and cooperation between organizations, as well as help create trust and confidence in the relationship.  There are many different PRM techniques available, and each organization will likely require a different approach in order to achieve the desired results. Some common techniques include goal setting, communication planning, problem solving, and conflict resolution.  PRM is an important aspect of any relationship, and should be used cautiously in order to avoid damaging or ruining the relationship. However, if used correctly, PRM can be an essential tool for managing successful relationships between organizations.

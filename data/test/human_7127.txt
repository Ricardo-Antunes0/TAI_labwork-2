Leptospermum rupicola is a low-growing shrub that is endemic to New South Wales where it grows near cliffs. It has thin, rough bark, narrow lance-shaped leaves, white flowers and relatively large fruit that remain on the plant at maturity. Description Leptospermum rupicola is a low-growing shrub that typically grows to a height  or less. It has thin, firm bark, the younger stems with flattened hairs at first and a conspicuous flange. The leaves are narrow lance-shaped, about  long and  wide with a sharp point on the tip and tapering at the base but without a petiole. The flowers are white,  wide and are borne singly on short side shoots from adjacent leaf axils. There are a few reddish-brown bracts at the base of the young flower buds but they are soon shed. The floral cup is glabrous, about  long and the sepals about  long. The petals are about  long and the stamens  long. Flowering mainly occurs from March to May and from September to October. The fruit is a capsule  in diameter, the sepals having fallen off, and that remains on the plant when mature.

The first Nordic Cookbook Museum is located in MÃ¥ltidens hus, Grythyttan, Sweden. The museum was inaugurated March 17, 2000 and is operated by the Grythyttan School of Hospitality, Culinary Arts & Meal Science. The room where the museum is situated is in a special built Kaba - a black cube. The architect Magnus Silfverhielm, fascinated by Arabic culture, made the Kaba to resemble a "holy" place for people interested in culinary arts, a bit like a "Mecca" for the like minded. The museum has, through the project of interior design and choice of materials, tried to find connections to Tore Wretman. He was one of Sweden's biggest cookbook authors and much of his work is on display at the museum. Had it not been for Carl Jan Granqvist his books would today have been spread out around the world. The books were auctioned out in London during 1997, where Carl Jan Granqvist bought the majority for the Swedish Academy of Culinary Arts & Meal Science.

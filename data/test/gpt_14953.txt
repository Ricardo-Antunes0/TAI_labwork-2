Port Ballona was situated, from circa 1859 to 1965, on Ballona Creek, in San Mateo County, California. It was a small town with a post office, general store, and a population of about 50. The town was named for the Ballona Creek which ran through it.  Today the site is occupied by the Port of Los Angeles and the Ballona Creek State Park. The creek has been culverted and the original town site is now submerged beneath the Port of Los Angeles container terminal.

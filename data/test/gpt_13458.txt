The Massif des Maures (, "plateau of the Moors") is a mountain range in the south of France, located between Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te d'Azur and the Languedoc-Roussillon region. The range stretches for over 350 km from the Pyrenees to the Mediterranean Sea. The highest peak is Le Moustier at 3,844 m.  The Massif des Maures is made up of a series of ridges that run parallel to the Mediterranean Sea. The ridges are divided by deep gorges, some with spectacular waterfalls. The landscape is hilly and densely wooded, with narrow valleys and high peaks. There are several large lakes in the Massif des Maures, including Lac du Var, Lac de Gavarnie, Lac de Villefranche-de-Conflent and Lac du Saint-Girons.  The Massif des Maures is a popular hiking destination, and many of the ridges are easy to walk. There are also several well-marked trails that follow old cattle tracks. The Massif des Maures is also popular for mountain biking, rock climbing and skiing.

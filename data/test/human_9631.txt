"Grown-Up Christmas List" (sometimes titled "My Grown-Up Christmas List") is a Christmas song composed by David Foster (music) and Linda Thompson-Jenner (lyrics). It was originally recorded by Foster, with Natalie Cole on vocals, for his 1990 non-holiday album River of Love and a similar second version on his 1993 holiday album The Christmas Album. Though it was also released as a single, the song was not a hit upon its first appearance. In 1992, Amy Grant recorded a version for her second Christmas album, Home for Christmas. Grant's version featured an additional verse that Grant penned herself. Her record label at the time, A&M Records, promoted the song as the second single from the album, and it received substantial radio airplay. In 2003, original  American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson performed "Grown-Up Christmas List" on the show's Christmas special, and the song was released on the album American Idol: Great Holiday Classics, which resulted in renewed airplay of the song during the holiday season that year.

Horace Francis Page (October 20, 1833 – September 27, 1899) was an American astronomer, mathematician, and physicist. He is best known for his discovery of the Page-Walker effect, as well as his contributions to the theory of electric currents.  Page was born in Boston, Massachusetts on October 20, 1833. He received his A.B. from Harvard College in 1855 and his M.A. from the same institution in 1858. He then studied at Göttingen and at Paris, where he received his doctorate in 1862. After returning to the United States, Page became an instructor at Harvard and then an associate professor there in 1870. In 1880 he was appointed a full professor at Harvard, a position he held until his death in 1899.  Page made many contributions to astronomy and mathematics and is best known for his discovery of the Page-Walker effect. This is a phenomenon that occurs when electric currents flow through a material such as metal or glass and cause it to move or jump up and down. Page also made contributions to the theory of electric currents and helped develop the principles of radio transmission. He died on September 27, 1899.

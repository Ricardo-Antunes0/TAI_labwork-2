Grand Ages: Rome (previously known as Imperium Romanum) is a turn-based strategy video game developed by Paradox Development Studios and published by Paradox Interactive. It is the fourth installment in the Grand Ages series, following Crusader Kings II and its two expansions, The Republic and The Byzantine Empire.  The game was released on June 2, 2016, for Microsoft Windows and macOS. A Linux version was announced in February 2017 but has yet to be released.  The game is set in the late 4th century AD, shortly before the end of the Roman Empire. The player has control over a dynasty of Roman emperors, from the very beginning of their rule to its end. They must manage their resources, build up their empire, and face challenges from both within and outside their borders.

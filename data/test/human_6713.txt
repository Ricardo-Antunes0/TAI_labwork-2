Mr William Collins is a fictional character in the 1813 novel Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. He is the distant cousin of Mr Bennet, a clergyman and holder of a valuable living at the Hunsford parsonage near Rosings Park, the estate of his patroness Lady Catherine De Bourgh, in Kent. Since Mr and Mrs Bennet have no sons, Mr Collins is also the current heir presumptive to the Bennet family estate of Longbourn in Meryton, Hertfordshire, due to the estate being entailed to heirs male. Mr Collins is first introduced during his visit to Longbourn.  His dull-witted character is in parallel to another 'Austen' character, Mr. Rushworth, from Mansfield Park.  Mr Collins is also somewhat comparable to the Shakespearean character, Malvolio, from Twelfth Night. Background Mr William Collins, 25 years old as the novel begins, is Mr Bennet's distant cousin, a clergyman, and the heir presumptive to Mr Bennet's estate of Longbourn. The property is entailed to heirs male, meaning that Mr Bennet's daughters and their issue cannot inherit after Mr. Bennet dies. Unless Mr Bennet has a son (which he and Mrs Bennet have no expectation of), the estate of Â£2,000-per-annum will pass to Mr Collins.

An aid agency, also known as development aid agency or international aid organization, is a type of organisation that provides assistance to developing countries. They are typically funded by governments or private donors, and their aim is to promote economic development, social progress, and humanitarianism.  Aid agencies have been found to be more effective than traditional development assistance in achieving long-term development goals such as reducing poverty and increasing life expectancy. They often work in partnership with local organisations and communities to deliver their programmes, and are often responsible for coordinating a wide range of humanitarian assistance programmes.  There are many different types of aid agencies, including international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), bilateral agencies, global organizations, and regional organizations. Some aid agencies provide direct assistance to people in need, while others focus on funding projects that help improve the socioeconomic conditions of the population. Aid agencies are often highly specialized in their field and offer a variety of services, including education, health care, economic development, and Disaster Management.

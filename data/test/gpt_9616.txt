Self-perpetuation, the capability of something to cause its own continued existence, is a fundamental property of some systems. It is also a key factor in the survival and success of these systems.  Self-perpetuation occurs when a system maintains itself in some way or another, even if it is not constantly supplied with energy or material inputs. It can be achieved through various mechanisms, such as self-replenishing resources, feedback loops, and evolution.  Self-perpetuation can be an important factor in the survival and success of systems. It can help ensure that the system remains in place and alters its behaviour in a way that benefits the system. This can help the system to survive and flourish, even when it is not constantly supplied with energy or material inputs.

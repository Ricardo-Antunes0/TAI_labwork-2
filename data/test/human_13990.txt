The True Furqan  is a book written in Arabic that tries to imitate the Qur'an but incorporating elements of traditional Christian teaching. Reception According to Baptist News, Al-Mahdy, a member of the executive committee of "Project Omega 2001" released The True Furqan in April 1999 saying that Muslims "have not received the true message of the gospel". The book is attributed to authors who go by the pseudonyms of "Al Saffee" and "Al Mahdee", and was translated into English by Anis Shorrosh, who calls it "a tool to liberate Muslims", and who believes that Muhammad is "the antichrist". It contains 77 numbered chapters, plus a prologue and epilogue. According to Shorrosh, The True Furqan is an attempt to respond to the challenge in the Quran that none can create a work like it, and incorporates a Christian rather than Islamic message.  "This book apparently reproduced the Quranic style so effectively that some who recited it aloud in public areas were thanked by Arab Muslims for having recited the Quran itself."

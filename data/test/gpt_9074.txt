The Belgian Chess Championship is a championship chess tournament organized by the Belgian Chess Federation. It is the country's most important chess event, and is played annually. The current titleholder is Maxime Vachier-Lagrave.  The tournament was first held in 1892, and has been held every year since then with the exception of 1915-1918 and 1939-1945 due to World War II. The current champion is Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, who won the title in 2016. The reigning World Champion, Magnus Carlsen, did not participate in this year's championship.   Belgium has produced several top chess players, including world champions Paul Morphy (1837-1884), Emanuel Lasker (1868-1941), Max Euwe (1902-1975), and Bobby Fischer (1947-1992).

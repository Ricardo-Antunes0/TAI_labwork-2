The Exilles Fort (pronounced : egzil - yuh) is an earthen and wooden fortification located in the town of Exilles, near the city of A Coru√±a, in Galicia, northwestern Spain.  The Exilles Fort was constructed during the Middle Ages on a strategic site on the border of Galicia and Asturias. It served as a border fortification and was used by the Asturian and Galician kingdoms to control trade routes between their respective territories. The fortifications were expanded during the 16th century and later used by the Spanish military to protect the area from invasions by French, Portuguese, and English forces.  The fort is now a tourist attraction and is open to visitors from Monday to Saturday from 10:00am to 12:00pm and from 2:00pm to 4:00pm. It is also open on Sundays from 11:00am to 1:00pm.

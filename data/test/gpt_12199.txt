The Joint Intelligence Operations Center Europe (JIOCEUR) is a NATO intelligence organization, located in the Belgian city of Brussels. It was established in December 2002 as a result of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Warsaw Summit declaration that member countries should establish permanent joint analysis centers. JIOCEUR is subordinate to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe.  JIOCEUR provides overall direction for intelligence collection, analysis, and dissemination within NATO, as well as facilitating cooperation on intelligence matters between NATO and its partners. It provides support to NATO's military operations by providing intelligence on potential threats to allies and by providing support for Allied Command Operations. It also coordinates the activities of the NATO Military Intelligence Service (MIS).  As of September 2013, JIOCEUR had a staff of around 180 officers and civilians. The organization is headed by a director who reports to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe.

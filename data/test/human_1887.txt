Kathryn Ann Moler (born  1966) is an American physicist, and current Dean of Research at Stanford University. She received her BSc (1988) and Ph.D. (1995) from Stanford University.  After working as a visiting scientist at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in 1995, she held a postdoctoral position at Princeton University from 1995-1998.  She joined the faculty of Stanford University in 1998, and became an Associate in CIFAR's Superconductivity Program (now called the Quantum Materials Program) in 2000.  She became an Associate Professor (with tenure) at Stanford in 2002 and is currently a Professor of Applied Physics and of Physics at  Stanford. She currently works in the Geballe Laboratory for Advanced Materials (GLAM),  and is the Director of the Center for Probing the Nanoscale (CPN), a National Science Foundation-funded center where Stanford and IBM scientists continue to improve scanning probe methods for measuring, imaging, and controlling nanoscale phenomena. She lists her scientific interests and main areas of research and experimentation as:  Single vortex dynamics in classical and high temperature superconductors,  Spontaneous currents and vortex effects in highly correlated electron systems, and   Mesoscopic superconductors and currents in normal metal rings, with an increasing interest in the spin properties of such small structures.

Rock Rest is a historic house and African-American traveler's accommodation at 167 Brave Boat Harbor Road in Kittery, Maine.  The property was operated as a summer guest house by Clayton and Hazel Sinclair between 1946 and 1977, and is one of the few known places in Maine that explicitly welcomed African-American guests in an era when racial discrimination in public accommodations was common.  The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Description and history Rock Rest is located on the northwest side of Brave Boat Harbor Road (on this section designated Maine State Route 103), just east of its junction with Galley Farm Lane.  The main house, set close to the road, is a -story wood frame Cape style house, with full shed-roof dormers to the front and rear providing a substantial second floor.  A large glassed-in porch extends to the right, and a gabled porch shelters the front entry.  To the right (north) of the house is a driveway, with a guest house/garage set back from the street.  From the street it appears as a two-bay garage with a half story above; from this a larger and wider structure extends to the rear.  This rear space housed a common area on the ground floor and guest rooms on the second floor.

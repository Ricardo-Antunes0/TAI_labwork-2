MidSouthCon is an American science-fiction convention held each March in Memphis, Tennessee, since 1982, evolving from similar events in the late 1970s.  Focusing mainly on science fiction literature, it provides basic programming geared to other genres: fantasy, science, comics, horror, and gaming.  It is also the event at which the Darrell Awards Jury presents its annual Darrell Awards. History Memphis Fandom got restarted in 1970 (after a small group in the early 1940s was dissolved upon being drafted for World War II) with the formation of the Mid-South Fantasy Association (MSFA). In the late 1970s, they decided to put on a relaxacon, and after its success, decided to start putting on a yearly science fiction convention. Several different names were used, before choosing MidSouthCon as the permanent name for the convention. It was decided to start the numbering of this new MidSouthCon at 2 since the name had been used before: MidSouthCon 1 was held in Huntsville, Alabama, on June 20â€“22, 1980, and the very first DeepSouthCon in 1963 was also named MidSouthCon.

Whaling in Iceland began with spear-drift hunting as early as the 12th century, and continued in a vestigial form until the late 19th century, when other countries introduced modern commercial practices. Today, Iceland is one of a handful of countries that formally object to an ongoing moratorium established by the International Whaling Commission in 1986, and that still maintain a whaling fleet. One company remains concentrated on hunting fin whales, largely for export to Japan, while the only other one previously hunted minke whales for domestic consumption until 2020, as the meat was popular with tourists.  In 2018, Icelandic whalers were accused of slaughtering a blue whale. Whaling has been temporarily paused in Iceland since 2019 as coronavirus restrictions, competition from subsidized Japanese whaling, and increasing domestic whale watching tourism have hampered the industry. It is uncertain if commercial whaling will resume in 2022. A ban may also come about by 2024 due to low demand and profitability. Iceland has a whale watching sector, which exists in tension with the whaling industry. History

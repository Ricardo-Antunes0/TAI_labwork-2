Founded in 1939 by Peter Yates and Frances Mullen in their modest Rudolf Schindler-designed Silverlake home, Monday Evening Concerts (MEC) is the world's longest-running series devoted to contemporary music. Originally envisioned as a forum for displaced European emigrés and virtuoso Hollywood studio musicians to sink their teeth into the most challenging solo and chamber music of the day (such as the works of Charles Ives, Alexander Scriabin and Béla Bartók), MEC has presented contemporary concerts continuously since. Founding  The organization launched its first season as “Evenings on the Roof,” A series of 12 concerts (6 programs, each performed twice) mixing classical and contemporary works, performed at the top floor of the home of Peter Yates and Frances Mullen at 1735 Micheltorena Street in Los Angeles. The series was priced at 50 cents per concert, or $3.00 for the complete series. Performers were drawn from world-class studio and classical musicians living in Los Angeles.

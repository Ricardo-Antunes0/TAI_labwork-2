Birth weight is the body weight of a newborn infant at birth. Birth weight is used to determine the risk of health problems in later life, such as obesity, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.  Human babies are born with a weight that ranges from about 1.3 kg (2.9 pounds) for a baby born at 37 weeks gestation to about 3 kg (6.6 pounds) for a baby born at 38 weeks gestation. The average birth weight in the United States is 3.3 kg (7.1 pounds). Babies born prematurely or with low birth weight are at higher risk for health problems in later life.

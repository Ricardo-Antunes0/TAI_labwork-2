In theater, an understudy, referred to in UK English as an understudy stage manager, is a person who substitutes for a principal actor or actress during their performance. The term is also used in other performing arts, such as music and ballet.  An understudy may be appointed by the director or manager of a theater, or may be hired by the actor or actress themselves. They usually receive less pay than the principal actor or actress, and are usually given less lines or less important scenes. An understudy is sometimes called on to act as a back-up should the principal actor or actress become ill or unable to perform.

The Ripon Spa Baths are a grade II listed building in Ripon, North Yorkshire, England.  It was built between 1904â€“05 as a spa but failed to compete with the larger facilities at nearby Harrogate.  In 1936 a new pool was constructed to the rear and the facility converted to a swimming baths.  The building is noted for its ornate terracotta-clad frontage and received listed building protection in 1980.  Harrogate Borough Council proposed selling the building for housing development in 2008 on the grounds that it required significant structural repair.  The sale was cancelled but in 2021 the council made a new proposal to sell the structure. Background  Ripon is a small cathedral city in North Yorkshire, located around  north of the larger settlement of Harrogate, a traditional spa town.  There was some interest in providing a public bathing facility in Ripon in the late 19th century and this was the first campaign of the local Women's Institute.  The cathedral paid to construct 20 changing cubicles on the banks of the River Ure in 1890 but campaigning continued for an indoor facility.  Unlike Harrogate Ripon was poorly served by natural springs, having only two of note that provided small quantities of water, insufficient to supply a spa facility.

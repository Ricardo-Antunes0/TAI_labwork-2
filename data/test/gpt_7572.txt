Murray Battery was an artillery battery located in the countryside of the town of Murray, Scotland.  The battery was originally built in 1885 and consisted of four 12-pounder guns. It served in the First World War as part of the British Army's artillery forces, and was eventually disbanded in 1920. In 1941 it was reactivated as a coast defence battery and served until it was decommissioned for good in 1968.  Today, the battery is privately owned and is not open to the public.

St Jovite (11 March 1989 â€“ 9 January 2016) was an American bred, Irish-trained Thoroughbred racehorse bred and owned by Virginia Kraft Payson. He was sired by Pleasant Colony, winner of the 1981 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. His dam, Northern Sunset, was a granddaughter of the pre-eminent sire of the 20th century, Northern Dancer. Sent to race on European turf courses under Irish trainer Jim Bolger, in 1991 St Jovite was voted the Champion 2-year-old in Ireland after winning the Anglesey and Futurity Stakes. At three, the colt ran second to Dr Devious in the 1992 Epsom Derby. St Jovite then defeated Dr Devious by twelve lengths while setting a new Curragh Racecourse record in winning the Irish Derby. Following his win over older horses in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, St. Jovite ran second again by a short-head to Dr Devious in the Irish Champion Stakes.

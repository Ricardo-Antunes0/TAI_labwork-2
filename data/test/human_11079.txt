Wilhelm Zaisser (20 June 1893 – 3 March 1958) was a German communist politician and statesman who served as the first Minister for State Security of the German Democratic Republic (1950–1953). Life  Born in Gelsenkirchen, Westphalia, Zaisser studied to become a teacher from 1910 to 1913 in Essen. When World War I began a year later, Zaisser joined the army. Upon leaving the service in 1918, Zaisser joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) and in 1919 returned to Essen, where he became a school teacher. During this period, Zaisser became an active communist. During the Kapp Putsch in 1920, he was a military leader of the fledgling Red Ruhr Army. Zaisser's activities in the Red Ruhr Army led to his arrest and dismissal as a teacher in 1921. After his release, Zaisser worked for the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) as a propagandist. From 1921 to 1922, Zaisser edited the Ruhr Echo and the Bergischen Voice of the People.  In 1923, Zaisser entered the KPD intelligence service and worked actively against the French occupation of the Ruhr. Zaisser's efficient work caused him to be sent to Moscow a year later, where he received political and military training.

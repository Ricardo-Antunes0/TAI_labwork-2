Lenin's Plan of "Monumental Propaganda" – is a strategy proposed by Vladimir Lenin of employing visual monumental art (revolutionary slogans and monumental sculpture) as an important means for propagating revolutionary and communist ideas.  "The plan" had the significance of creating a large demand for monumental sculpture on a state level, and thus it stands at the origins of the Soviet school of sculpture. The "plan" consisted of two main projects:  (1) – decorating buildings and other surfaces "traditionally used for banners and posters" with revolutionary slogans and memorial relief plaques;  (2) – vast erection of "temporary, plaster-cast" monuments in honor of great revolutionary leaders. Plan Realization of the plan was initiated with a decree issued by Sovnarkom (the Council of People's Commissars) "On Republic's monuments" (sanctioned April 12, 1918), which ordained removal of monuments "erected in honor of tzars and their servants" and the development of projects for monuments to the Russian Socialist Revolution" . The section of visual arts of Narkompros (People's Commissariat for Education) drew up a list of personalities in honor of whom the monuments were to be erected.  Included in the list were not only revolutionaries and great public figures but also great Russian and foreign scientists, philosophers, poets and writers, artists, composers and actors – 67 persons in all. In addition to sculptures of individuals the plan of monumental propaganda also assumed projects for allegorical compositions.

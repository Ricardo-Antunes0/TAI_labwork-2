The Parker Trio was a Southern Gospel music group founded in 1995. The group originated from Pickering, Ontario but was based in Nashville, Tennessee and most of its performances were in the US. The group initially consisted of Warren Parker, his wife Shannan Parker, and Vanessa Young. In 2004, Young left the group and was replaced by Angie White, whose husband Brandt White was their tour bus driver and sound technician. On January 8, 2006, Warren Parker was struck by a truck and killed while touring with the trio in South Carolina. The group released five CDs, including a live concert DVD, recorded in Havana, Illinois. Their albums won several Gospel Music Association of Canada Covenant Awards and Shai Awards. While on tour, the group ministered in churches, and many different types of venues, including many prisons and drug rehabilitation centres; they were known to perform as many as 260 concerts a year.

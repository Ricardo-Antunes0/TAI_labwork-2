Spinterface is a term coined to indicate the interface between people and technology. It is used to describe the way that people interact with, and use, technology.  Spinterface can be broken down into three different aspects: physical, cognitive, and social. Physical aspects include how people interact with technology devices, such as how they hold them, how they move them, and how they use them. Cognitive aspects include how people think about and use technology, such as their understanding of its features and how they use those features to achieve their goals. Social aspects include the way people interact with each other and the environment around them, such as whether they share information or make jokes around technology devices.  The goal of spinterface is to allow people to use technology in ways that are comfortable and effective for them. This can be done by ensuring that all three aspects of spinterface are addressed. Physical aspects can be addressed by making devices smaller and more lightweight so that they are easier to hold and use. Cognitive aspects can be addressed by making devices easier to understand and use, and providing tutorials or other assistance when needed. Social aspects can be addressed by ensuring that devices are designed with users in mind, and by creating an environment where users feel comfortable sharing information or joking around with each other.

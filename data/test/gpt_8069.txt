Manufacturing in Vietnam after reunification followed a similar trajectory to that of other East Asian countries. Initially, Vietnam relied on foreign investment and technology transfer to develop its industry. After the market liberalization of the 1990s, however, the country began to attract domestic and foreign investors and to develop its own industry. Vietnam now has a number of factories producing a wide range of products, from textiles and food products to electronics and automotive components.  The government has made efforts to support the manufacturing sector by providing tax breaks, funding for infrastructure development, and preferential access to foreign capital. The country also has a skilled workforce and is well-positioned to take advantage of new technologies. However, Vietnam faces challenges in terms of competition from low-cost countries, poor infrastructure, and protectionism.

Monmouth Coffee Company is a coffee roaster, retailer and wholesaler in London, which was founded in 1978. It played an important role in regenerating Neal's Yard and Borough Market.  It has remained focused on roasting and selling coffee beans and was one of the foundations for the third wave of coffee in London after the year 2000. History Monmouth Coffee was founded in 1978 by Nick Saunders and Anita Leroy. Leroy later took over the business. Together with Neal's Yard Dairy and Saunders' other businesses, Monmouth Coffee transformed the run down area around Neal's Yard in Covent Garden, central London. The original shop was at 27 Monmouth Street , a grade II listed 18th-century terraced house. The basement was used to roast coffee and the ground floor as a tasting room. In its early years, the shop sold three or four kinds of green or roast coffee beans in sacks containing one, three, seven or ten pounds. Leroy wanted to buy coffee from individual farmers, but that was not possible until 1996, when a new coffee importer, Mercanta, opened. Monmouth Coffee was one of their early customers. Monmouth Coffee and Mercanta were a foundation for the third wave of artisan coffee shops in London after 2000 and several Monmouth Coffee baristas went on to found their own coffee businesses.

St. Catharines is the largest city in the Canadian province of Ontario. Located in Southern Ontario on the Niagara River, it is the seat of the Regional Municipality of St. Catharines. With a population of 195,283 in the 2011 census, it is Canada's eighth-largest city, and the largest in the Greater Toronto Area.  The city was named after Saint Catharine of Alexandria, an early Christian martyr. The region has been inhabited by aboriginal peoples for thousands of years. The first Europeans to explore the area were the French in 1615. The British established Fort Niagara in 1759 and built Fort Caroline at the present-day site of Niagara-on-the-Lake in 1764. The area became part of the United States after its victory in the American Revolutionary War and was administered as part of Upper Canada. After being purchased from the British by the Province of Canada in 1817, it was incorporated as a city in 1834. It became a regional capital with provincial government responsibilities under the City of Toronto Act in 1998.  St. Catharines is home to several universities, including Brock University, Niagara College, and Trent University. It is also home to Canad Inns Stadium, which is used primarily for baseball and soccer games and has hosted several Major League Baseball playoff games and two FIFA World Cup matches.

Maria Hopf (13 September 1913 â€“ 24 November 2002) was an Austrian-born American composer and music theorist.  Hopf was born in Vienna, Austria, on 13 September 1913. She studied at the University of Vienna with Arnold Schoenberg and Heinrich Schenker. Hopf emigrated to the United States in 1938, and became a naturalized citizen in 1943.  Hopf's early music showed the influence of Schoenberg and Mahler, but she later developed a distinctive style of her own. Her compositions include orchestral works, chamber music, choral works, and solo pieces; many are inspired by texts by writers such as Kahlil Gibran and Rainer Maria Rilke. Her most enduring works are her string quartets, which have been performed by many leading ensembles worldwide.  Hopf died in Berkeley, California, on 24 November 2002.

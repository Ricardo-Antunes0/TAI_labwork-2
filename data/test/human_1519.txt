Berliner Thor- und Fußballclub Elf 1900 was a German association football club from the Schöneberg district of south central Berlin. Predecessor to current day club BSC Kickers 1900 Berlin, it was established 1 November 1900 — which Kickers take as their foundation date — and was active as an independent side until 1912. The German term Elf is the number 11 and refers to the month of the club's founding. From 1904 to 1906 BTuFC Elf was part of the Märkischen Meisterschaft, one of two competing top-flight city leagues, where they earned only lower table finishes. In 1912, they merged with Berliner Fußballclub Hubertus 05 to form Berliner Sportclub Hubertuself. A second merger in 1923 with Ballspielverein Sportlust Borussia 1899 Schöneberg created Schöneberger FC Kickers 1900 which won promotion to the Oberliga Berlin-Brandenburg (I). BSV was the product of an earlier 1920 union between TuFC Sportlust 1904 and Schöneberger FC Borussia which had been formed 1 March 1899 as Berliner TuFC Borussia.

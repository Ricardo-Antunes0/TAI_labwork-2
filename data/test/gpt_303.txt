Ovenbirds or furnariids are a large family of passerine birds which includes the ovenbirds, New World warblers, Old World warblers and thrushes. They are characterised by their strong legs and powerful beaks which they use to extract food from the oven-like nests built in trees. The family is distributed across the world, with a majority of species occurring in North America and South America.

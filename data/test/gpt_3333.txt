Adji Bousso Dieng is a Senegalese Computer Scientist and Engineer who has made significant contributions to artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning. He is also known for his work on large-scale machine learning algorithms and systems, especially in the context of image recognition and natural language processing.  Born in Senegal in 1967, Adji Bousso Dieng received his B.S. from the University of Dakar in 1991 and his M.S. from the University of Washington in 1994. He completed his Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley in 1998 under the supervision of Geoffrey Hinton, with a thesis on "Large Scale Learning Algorithms for Image Recognition".  After completing his Ph.D., Dieng was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign before joining the faculty at Stanford University as an associate professor in 2000. He was promoted to full professor in 2007 and has been a member of the Stanford Computer Science Department since then.  Dieng's research focuses on artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on large-scale problems and systems. His work has led to significant advances in these fields, including improvements to image recognition and natural language processing performance.  He is also known for his work on large-scale machine learning algorithms and systems, especially in the context of image recognition and natural language processing. One of his earliest contributions was the development of a large-scale Bayesian network algorithm for image recognition

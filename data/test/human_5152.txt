Case & Draper was a photographic studio partnership in Skagway, Alaska between William Howard Case and Horace H. Draper. Their work included photographs of the Tlingit, portraits, scenery, and gold rush era images. Digital collections of their work are available at the Orbis Cascade Alliance and the Alaska State Library, which has images of their photographic tent as well as their dog team and sled in front of their store. From 1907 to 1914, the studio was known as Draper and Co. History  Case arrived in Skagway in 1898 and established the partnership with Draper the same year. The photographers established their business in a photographic tent, allowing them to travel and take photographs. "Documenting the unknown" made them popular and they eventually moved into a storefront and sold curios, photographic equipment, and souvenirs, along with their work. They received a contract from White Pass and Yukon Route to photograph the scenery along the railway route in 1901. They opened a branch studio in Juneau in 1905.

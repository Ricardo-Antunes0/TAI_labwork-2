Grand Hyatt Washington is a hotel in Washington, D.C., in the United States. The 897-room hotel, located at 1000 H Street NW, serves both tourist and business travel. From the time the hotel opened until 2003, it was directly across from the Washington Convention Center and served as a "convention headquarters" hotel for many conventions. The convention center closed and was demolished in 2004. CityCenterDC, a major office, residential, and retail complex, now occupies the site. About the hotel Quadrangle Development broke ground for the Grand Hyatt Hotel on February 21, 1985. The site was directly across the street from the Washington Convention Center. The structure was designed by RTKL Associates, an architectural firm based in Annapolis, Maryland. The hotel featured a vast atrium over the lobby that ran to the roof. The inspiration for the atrium was a similar structure designed by John C. Portman, Jr. and built in Atlanta, Georgia, in the 1960s. The ground floor of the atrium was designed to feature a waterfall and fish lagoon, designed by engineer Howard Fields. At the time of the groundbreaking, planners expected the hotel to have 950 rooms and cost $130 million to construct. By June, the hotel's room count had dropped to 910, and by July the cost had soared to $150 million. By December 1986, the room count had fallen to 907, and a  water feature (lagoon and waterfall) had been added to the atrium.

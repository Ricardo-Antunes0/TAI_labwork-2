In telephony, pair gain is the transmitting power of a telephone system, measured in watts, that is available to support two telephone calls simultaneously.  Pair gain is an important factor in designing a telephone system. It is the ratio of the output power of the telephone system to the input power required to support two simultaneous calls. The higher the pair gain, the greater the amount of power that can be transferred to the users.  Telephone systems use different amounts of power depending on their configuration. For example, a landline telephone system typically uses more power to transmit voice than a wireless phone system. This is because a landline system uses an electrical conductor to transmit voice signals, while a wireless system uses radio waves.

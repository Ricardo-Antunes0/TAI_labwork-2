The Hungarian Communist Party (, abbr. MKP), also known as the Hungarian Workers' Party (, MKKP), was a communist party in Hungary.  The MKP was founded on 18 March 1919, after the split in the Hungarian Socialist Party. The party was banned in 1948 and its members were persecuted during the communist dictatorship of Hungary. The party was revived in 1987 and participated in the 1990 elections, but failed to win any seats. It merged with the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party to form the Hungarian Socialist Partyâ€“Communist Party in 1998.

Aryabhata (, ISO: ) or Aryabhata I (, romanized: Aśvaghoṣa; c. 476 – c. 535 CE) was a Sanskrit astronomer, mathematician and physicist from the ancient Indian subcontinent. He is generally considered the most significant mathematician of ancient India and one of the greatest astronomers of all time, and is credited with developing the Aryabhata number system.  Aryabhata was born in 476 in a small town in present-day Bihar province. Little is known about his early life, but he showed an early interest in mathematics and astronomy. He is thought to have travelled to other parts of India to study with various teachers, and he is also thought to have visited China.  In 499, Aryabhata published his most famous work, the Aryabhatiya (or Aryabhatottara), which is a comprehensive treatise on the mathematics and astronomy of his time. In this work, Aryabhata developed a system of celestial coordinates that is still in use today. He also developed a number system known as the Aryabhata number system, which is used to represent numbers in India and other parts of Asia.  Aryabhata died in 535 CE at the age of 80. His work has had a significant impact on mathematics and astronomy throughout the world, and he has been described as one of the greatest mathematicians and astronomers of all time.

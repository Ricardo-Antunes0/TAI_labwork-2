Malaluba Gumana (born 1953) is an Australian Aboriginal artist from Northeast Arnhem Land, who has gained prominence through her work in painting and the production of larrakitj, the memorial poles traditionally used by Yolngu people in mortuary ceremony. Her work is held in collection at the National Gallery of Australia and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. She has won awards in categories for bark painting and three-dimensional work at the Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards (NATSIAA). Her work is represented in the Kerry Stokes Larrakitj Collection, which was exhibited by the Art Gallery of Western Australia and also gained an exhibition place at the Sydney Biennale. Background  Gumana was born in 1953 and lived in the Gangan homeland of the Blue Mud Bay region in Northeast Arnhem Land. She is an artist with Buku-Larrŋgay Mulka Centre in Yirrkala, an Indigenous community-controlled art centre of Northeast Arnhem Land. Her complex and fluid paintings frequently refer to the story of the all-powerful Rainbow Serpent or ‘wititj’ (olive python) as it travels through her mother's Gålpu clan lands. She mainly represents the Gålpu clan designs of ‘dhatam’ (water lily), ‘djari’ (rainbow), ‘djayku’ (file snake) and ‘wititj’ (olive python), applying the technique of ‘marwat’ (cross-hatching) using a finely controlled hair brush. Intellectual property rights of clan designs are held by the clan, and only people with rights to certain designs are able to use them.

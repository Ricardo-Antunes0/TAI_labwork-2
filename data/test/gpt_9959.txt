A clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) is a medical condition that is not caused by any other medical condition. The term is used to describe a group of symptoms that are not normally associated with the person's other health conditions. CIS can occur for a number of reasons, such as a new infection, a reaction to a medication, or a side effect of another condition.  Clinically isolated syndrome can be a serious medical condition. It can cause problems with everyday activities and can be very difficult to treat. If left untreated, CIS can lead to more serious problems, such as disability or death.  There is no one definitive cause of clinically isolated syndrome. However, it is often caused by a new infection, a reaction to a medication, or a side effect of another condition. Sometimes CIS can be caused by something that you have no control over, such as a virus or an allergy.  If you are experiencing symptoms suggestive of clinically isolated syndrome, it is important to consult your doctor. Your doctor may be able to provide you with tests to confirm that you have CIS and suggest treatments for your symptoms.

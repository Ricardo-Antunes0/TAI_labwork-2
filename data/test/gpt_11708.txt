The Berkshire Downs are a range of hills in western Massachusetts, United States. The range is about 50 miles long, extending from the Connecticut River Valley in the south to the Connecticut River in the north. The highest point in the range is Mount Greylock, at 3,491 feet (1,067 m).  The Berkshire Downs are composed of a series of ridges and valleys that were formed by the movement of glaciers and the melting of ice sheets thousands of years ago. The hills are covered with a variety of wildlife, including moose, deer, bears, turkeys, and foxes. The range is home to several ski resorts, including Sugarbush Resort and Bretton Woods Resort.

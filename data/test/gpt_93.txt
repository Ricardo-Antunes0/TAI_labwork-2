Hapkido ( , , also spelled hapkido) is a Korean martial art that combines aspects of Jujutsu, Taekwondo, and Kung fu. It is primarily a striking art using hands and feet with emphasis on joint-locks and throws.  Hapkido was created by Choi Hong Son, who taught it to his son, Choi Kuk Soo. The name "hapkido" is a combination of the words "ha" meaning "hand" and "pkido" meaning "discipline". The art was first taught in South Korea in the 1940s by Choi Hong Son and his students.   The International Hapkido Federation (IHF) was founded in Seoul, South Korea in 1984. The IHF oversees the world governing body for hapkido, the World Hapkido Federation (WHF). There are currently over 51,000 registered hapkido practitioners from over 100 countries.

M. Francesca Cotrufo is a soil ecologist who focuses her work on litter decomposition and the dynamics of soil organic matter. She is currently a Professor and Associate Head in the Department of Soil and Crop Sciences, as well the Senior Scientist at the Natural Resource Ecology Lab, at Colorado State University. Early life and education  Cotrufo was born in Naples, Italy. In high school she was passionate about science and ancient Greek. Cotrufo decided to further her studies in Biology, rather than ancient languages, because of the possibility to make novel discoveries that were relevant to the world's problems. Cotrufo earned her B.S. in Biology from the University of Naples, Italy in 1991. While there, she became interested in the environment and litter decomposition. Cotrufo wrote her undergraduate honor thesis, "Effects of urban heavy metal pollution on organic matter decomposition in Quercus ilex woods," in the lab of the only professor of ecology at her university. She went on to earn her Ph.D. in Soil Ecology from Lancaster University, UK in 1995, where she worked with Phil Ineson as her advisor and studied soil organic matter and its formation from the decomposition of plant inputs.

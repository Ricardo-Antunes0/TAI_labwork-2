Digital Mums is a private education organisation, delivering online courses and qualifications to mothers in the UK and Ireland.   Digital Mums was founded in 2005 by a group of mothers who recognised the need for affordable and accessible education options for mothers. We offer a range of online courses and qualifications to mothers, providing them with the resources they need to improve their lives.   Our courses are designed to help mothers enhance their skills, knowledge and confidence. We offer a variety of courses that cover a wide range of topics, including parenting, health and wellbeing, digital skills, cooking and baking, finance and business, and more.   Digital Mums is committed to supporting motherhood in all its forms. Our courses are open to all mothers, regardless of their nationality or ethnicity. We hope that our services will help mothers to fulfil their potential and build a better future for themselves and their families.

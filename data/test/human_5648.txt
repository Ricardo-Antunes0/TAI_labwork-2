The 'Sikarwar" are a clan found in certain parts of North and Eastern India. They belong to Rajput caste. This branch of Rajputs get their name from Vijaypur Sikri (now Fatehpur Sikri), before it was conquered and passed into the hands of Turkic sultans. As Sikri fell under Turkic administration, Sikarwars broke up into two branches, which migrated in different regions. In Uttar Pradesh, they established Gahmar village in Ghazipur.  In Bihar, the Sikarwar Rajputs established the settlements of Kudra, Chainpur and Bhabua. Chainpur The area of Chainpur in Kaimur district of Bihar was historically ruled by Sikarwar Rajputs. A document called the Kursinama purports  to trace the ancestry of the Chainpur family to Fatehpur Sikri where the family was driven out during the Turkic Muslim ruler Babur's invasion. As they fled eastwards under the leadership of Lakshmi Mal, they eventually conquered Chainpur from the Chero dynasty which was ruled by the Chero tribe. Among the most important rulers of the Chainpur Sikarwars was Raja Salivahana'' who built Chainpur fort and was prominent in the region prior to the ascendancy of the Afghan warlord Sher Shah Suri.

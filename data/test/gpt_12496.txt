The Great Library of Alexandria in Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant library in the ancient world. It was destroyed by the Roman Emperor Julian in 36 BC.  The Library of Alexandria was founded in the 3rd century BC by Ptolemy I Soter, one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in Egypt. It was a center of scholarship and learning, and its vast collection of books and manuscripts is said to have been second only to the Library of Pergamum.  The library was open to anyone who wished to consult it, regardless of social class or religious affiliation. It was a place where scholars from all over the Mediterranean could come to study and exchange ideas.  The Library of Alexandria was destroyed by the Roman Emperor Julian in 36 BC. However, much of its contents had been previously copied onto papyrus scrolls and taken away to be stored in other libraries throughout the empire. The loss of the Library of Alexandria was a major blow to ancient scholarship, and it is still regarded as one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of all time.

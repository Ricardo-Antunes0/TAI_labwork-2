XCMS Online is a cloud version of the original XCMS technology (a bioinformatics software designed for statistical analysis of mass spectrometry data), created by the Siuzdak Lab at Scripps Research. XCMS introduced the concept of nonlinear retention time alignment that allowed for the statistical assessment of the detected peaks across LCMS and GCMS datasets. XCMS Online was designed to facilitate XCMS analyses through a cloud portal and as a more straightforward (non command driven) way to analyze, visualize and share untargeted metabolomic data. Further to this, the combination of XCMS and METLIN  allows for the identification of known molecules using METLIN's tandem mass spectrometry data, and enables the identification of unknown (uncharacterized molecules) via similarity searching of tandem mass spectrometry data. XCMS Online has also become a systems biology tool for integrating different omic data sets. As of January 2021, the XCMSOnline /METLIN platform has over 44,000 registered users. XCMS Online works by comparing groups of raw or preprocessed metabolomic data to discover metabolites using methods such as nonlinear retention time alignment and feature detection & matching. Once analysis is complete the data can be viewed several different ways including via bubble plots, heat maps, chromatograms, and box plots. In addition, XCMS Online is integrated with METLIN, a large metabolite database. The following file formats are supported for direct upload to the site.

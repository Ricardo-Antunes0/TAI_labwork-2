Elizabeth Laurie Rees (1885–1971), known as "Bessie", was an English-born Australian temperance and women's rights activist. She was a key leader in the Women's Christian Temperance Union of Victoria, serving twenty years as the general secretary. She also served in a variety of leadership roles for the national Australian WCTU, including treasurer, corresponding secretary, and national president. She was the inaugural editor of the national WCTU magazine, White Ribbon Signal. A devoted Baptist, she helped launch the Victorian Baptist Women's Association with Cecilia Downing in 1925. In 1928, as president of the Victorian Baptist Women's Association, she attended the World Baptist Congress in Toronto, Canada, and was the only woman to lead devotions at the event. In 1935, Rees was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal for her work on temperance. Early life and education Elizabeth Laurie Johnston was born on 18 December 1865 in London, England. Known by the nickname "Bessie", she was the daughter of Margaret (née Kirkcaldy) and Thomas Johnston. Her father was originally from Edinburgh, Scotland; at the time of Bessie's birth, he worked in England as a coach maker. When automobiles began to be used, he switched to building automobiles. Thomas and Margaret Johnstone moved their family to Australia in 1870, first living in Sydney, then moving to Victoria when Bessie was about ten years old. Bessie was the second oldest of seven children in the family.

In mathematics, semi-simplicity is a widespread concept in the theory of simplicial complexes.  Semi-simplicity is a desirable property for a simplicial complex, which is a collection of simplices. The complexity of a simplicial complex is the size of its largest simplicial subcomplex. A simplicial complex is semi-simple if it is not too large, and hence has a smaller complexity than any other possible simplicial complex.  Semi-simplicity is important for several reasons. First, it can be used to measure the complexity of algorithms for solving problems in simplicial complexes. Second, it can be used to identify patterns in the structure of a simplicial complex. Finally, it can be used to improve the design of Simplicial Complexes by identifying those that are already semi-simple and can be simplified further.

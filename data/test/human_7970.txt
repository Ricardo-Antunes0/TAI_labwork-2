, is a Japanese saving method. The word "kakeibo" can be translated as Household ledger and is literally meant for household financial management. Kakeibos vary in structure, but the basic idea is the same.

The user then records their own expenses on a daily basis, which are added together first at the end of the week and later at the end of the month. At the end of the month, a summary of the month's spending is written in kakeibo. In addition to expenses and income, thoughts and observations are written in kakeibo with the aim of raising awareness of one's own consumption. Kakeibo can be a finished book or self-made. History Kakeibo was developed by a Japanese women's journalist Motoko Hani who published the first  Kakeibo in a women's magazine in 1904.

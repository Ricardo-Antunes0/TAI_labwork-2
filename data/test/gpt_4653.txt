Polymer banknotes are banknotes made from a polymer material. They were first proposed in the early 2000s and were initially seen as a way to reduce the use of paper banknotes.  Polymer banknotes are made from a polymer material, which is a type of plastic. They were first proposed in the early 2000s and were initially seen as a way to reduce the use of paper banknotes. The main benefits of using polymer banknotes are that they are more durable than paper banknotes and they are less likely to be counterfeit. Polymer banknotes are also easier to produce than paper banknotes, which is why they have been seen as a potential replacement for paper banknotes. However, there are some limitations to using polymer banknotes. For example, they are not as resistant to water damage as paper banknotes and they can be more difficult to read in low light conditions.

Angus Robertson Fulton (1871â€“1958) was a Scottish surgeon and medical officer who was a pioneer in the use of X-rays in medical diagnosis. He is best known for his work on the use of X-rays to determine the cause of lung cancer.  Angus Robertson Fulton was born in 1871 in Edinburgh, Scotland. He studied at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated with a BSc in Medicine in 1896. After completing his medical training, Fulton worked as a surgeon in Glasgow.  In 1912, Fulton began work on a project that would become one of his most famous achievements: the use of X-rays to determine the cause of lung cancer. At the time, it was believed that lung cancer could only be caused by infections or tumors inside the body, and doctors had no way of determining which was responsible. Fulton's work led to the development of techniques used today to diagnose and treat lung cancer. Fulton retired from active medical practice in 1951, but continued to work on medical research until his death in 1958.

Radio & Records (R&R) was a trade magazine covering the music industry, published from 1958 to 1996.  In its early years, R&R was considered one of the leading sources of information for music fans, as well as the industry insiders. It was known for its in-depth coverage of new and emerging artists, as well as reviews of albums and singles. Over the years, the magazine's focus changed to reflect the changing music industry. It became less focused on new artists and more oriented towards classic rock and roll, country music, and soul music.  Despite this shift, R&R remained a respected source of information for musicians, record executives, and music fans. In 1996, the magazine ceased publication after nearly 50 years in business.

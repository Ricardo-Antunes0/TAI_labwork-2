In operating systems architecture a reference monitor is a software component that helps to control access to shared objects and resources. A reference monitor uses the principle of least privilege, which is a security principle that states that a user should have the least amount of access to resources that are necessary for their job.  A reference monitor helps to enforce security policies by limiting the access of users to shared objects and resources. This helps to protect the system against unauthorized access and abuse. Reference monitors can be used in a variety of operating systems such as Unix, Windows, and Linux.

Cellomics is the discipline of quantitative cell analysis using bioimaging methods and informatics with a workflow involving three major components: image acquisition, image analysis, and data visualization and management. These processes are generally automated. All three of these components depend on sophisticated software to acquire qualitative data, quantitative data, and the management of both images and data, respectively. Cellomics is also a trademarked term, which is often used interchangeably with high-content analysis (HCA) or high-content screening (HCS), but cellomics extends beyond HCA/HCS by incorporating sophisticated informatics tools. History HCS and the discipline of cellomics was pioneered by a once privately held company named Cellomics Inc., which commercialized instruments, software, and reagents to facilitate the study of cells in culture, and more specifically, their responses to potentially therapeutic drug-like molecules.  In 2005, Cellomics was acquired by Fisher Scientific International, Inc., now Thermo Fisher Scientific, which continues developing cellomics-centered products under its Thermo Scientificâ„¢ high content analysis product line.

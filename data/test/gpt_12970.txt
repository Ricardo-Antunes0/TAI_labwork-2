The Naysayer was a country-rock band founded in Lexington, Kentucky in 1984 by singer-guitarist Scott Miller and drummer Kenny Smith. The band was initially known as the Naysayers, but changed their name to avoid confusion with a Chicago punk band of the same name.  Miller and Smith played together in a previous band, the Nighthawks, before forming The Naysayer. The band released their debut album, "Lonely Nights", in 1985. The album spawned three singles, "Gimme Some Lovin'", "We're All Alone Tonight", and "I Can't Quit You Baby". The Naysayer followed up their debut album with 1987's "The Grass Is Always Greener" and 1988's "Naked". Both albums earned them a following in the country-rock genre.  In 1990, the band released its fourth album, "Strange Times". The album was not as well-received as their previous releases and the group broke up shortly afterward. Miller went on to form the country-rock band Whitey Morgan & the 78's. Smith later played drums in the alternative rock band Cactus.

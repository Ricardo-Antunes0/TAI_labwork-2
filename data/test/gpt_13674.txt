A command neuron is a single neuron in the brain that is responsible for initiating a specific action, such as moving a muscle.  Command neurons are important for the execution of complex tasks, such as walking or reaching for a object. They are also responsible for responding quickly to new situations. Command neurons can be identified by their large size and the presence of dense connections between them.

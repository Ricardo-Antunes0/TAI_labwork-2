The Brown Square House, now the Garrison-Douglass House, is a historic house at 207 West Street in Rochester, New York. It was built in 1839 and is a two-story brick building with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It was the home of Frederick Douglass from 1841 to 1845, and was one of the few houses owned by Douglass that is still standing.  The house was purchased in 1987 by the Rochester Historical Society, which transferred it to the National Park Service in 1994. It is now open for tours as part of the Douglass National Historic Site. The house has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1998.

The Fort of Milreu, also known as the Fort of St. Peter of Milreu , is situated on the Atlantic coast 3km north of the town of Ericeira in Lisbon District  of Portugal. Part of a programme to extend Portugal's coastal defences, it was built between 1670 and 1675. History The Fort of Milreu, was built after the Portuguese Restoration War between Portugal and Spain. Lessons learned from this war, which ended with the Treaty of Lisbon (1668), convinced the Portuguese of the need to reorganise their coastal defences by building numerous fortresses and forts along the entire coastline of the country. The choice of Milreu as a location to erect a fort was because this was the ideal place to both defend against maritime access to Ericeira from the north and protect against landings on the Beach of Ribeira de Ilhas, immediately to the north of the fort.

The Commission on Growth and Development (informally, the Growth Commission) was a group of international economists appointed by President Jimmy Carter in 1978 to make recommendations on how to improve economic growth and development around the world.  The Growth Commission was chaired by Nobel Laureate economist James Tobin and included such notable economists as Paul A. Samuelson, Kenneth J. Arrow, and Robert M. Solow. The commission produced a report, published in 1981, entitled "A Report on the Economics of Growth." The report advocated for policies that would promote economic growth and development, and called for increased investment in education and health care, as well as improved infrastructure. The commission's work has been influential in developing theories of sustained economic growth and has helped to shape policy around the world.

Texas v. Cobb, 532 U.S. 162 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that the Texas criminal code's prohibition of "adultery" was unconstitutional because it violated the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law.  The 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees all citizens of the United States "equal protection of the laws." This amendment was adopted in response to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which provided for harsh penalties for anyone who helped a runaway slave escape. The amendment made it illegal to treat black and white citizens differently based on their race.  In Texas v. Cobb, the Court ruled that Texas' prohibition of adultery was unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. The law made it a crime for a married person to engage in sexual activity with someone other than their spouse, even if that activity was not considered adultery under state law. The Court found that this law violated the principle of marital fidelity, which is a fundamental part of traditional marriage in Texas.

Bachelors At War is a reality show created by Television Broadcast Limited and hosted by Queenie Chan. It was broadcast weekday nights from 22:30 to 23:00 on Jade and HD Jade starting 10 June 2013 and was reviewed on Mytv.com for two months.   This show focused  on a group of middle-class men, described as “highly eligible bachelors" selected through social networking websites and a matchmaking company, trying to find spouses. They had to stand out during the evaluation conducted by the adjudicators, who were “Beauty Expert” Queenie Chan, Stylist Karl Hui and other experts. At the end, only eight men were “qualified” to be the bachelors.   The eight contestants were Vincent, who had never dated any Hong Kong girls; Justin, an extroverted and confident Chinese Canadian; Thomas, with no dating experience; Cyrus, who swore not to be a die-heart suitor; Rocky, a muscular man with an unappealing face; Winter, with a well-paid job but perceived as a freak; Chris, who was working in disco but didn't like "play girl" and Guy, an intelligent PhD graduate.    On the other hand, six ordinary but elegant ladies were selected. They were going to be introduced to the bachelors via videos. After receiving modification of appearance assisted by Karl, the bachelors encounter a broad range of challenges. They were evaluated by the judges and the female contestants and were eliminated from the show one by one until the best four bachelors selected. “The Best Four” were rewarded with travel to Indonesia along with the 6 females. Whether the females were impressed by the bachelors was supposedly all about the bachelors' sincerity and steadfastness. Content in each episode

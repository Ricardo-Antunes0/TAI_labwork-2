Pinus canariensis, the Canary Island pine, is a tree native to the Canary Islands in the Mediterranean Sea. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree growing to 10–20 m tall, with a trunk up to 1.5 m diameter and a brancheset up to 2 m wide. The bark is scaly and the leaves are needle-like, 30–50 cm long, with a blunt apex and a serrated margin. The cones are 8–10 cm long and 4–6 cm broad, with two scales on each side. The sweetly-scented resin is collected to make pine tar.

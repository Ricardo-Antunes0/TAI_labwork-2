Cobscook Bay is located in Washington County, Maine. The bay is approximately 10 miles long and 2 miles wide, with a depth of approximately 150 feet. Cobscook Bay is best known for its abundance of Acadian shrimp and for its annual lobster festival.   Cobscook Bay was first explored by Europeans in 1605, when French explorer Samuel de Champlain sailed into the bay and named it after the Coquille (or cob), a type of clam that was abundant in the area. The bay was later used as a refuge for British ships during the American Revolution. In 1839, Cobscook Bay was the site of the first commercial lobster fishery in the United States. The bay's lobster population has since grown exponentially, thanks in part to a lobster conservation program implemented in the 1970s.  Today, Cobscook Bay is home to a variety of wildlife, including deer, bears, moose, and seals. The bay also provides a natural habitat for a number of fish species, including striped bass and bluefish. The annual lobster festival, held in September, is one of the town's most popular events.

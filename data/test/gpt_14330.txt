English society comprises the group behaviour of people who share a social environment and interact with each other. It can be described in terms of its institutions, values, and norms.  As a highly developed country, English society is characterised by a complex institutional structure, a rich cultural heritage, and robust values. The country has a long history, and its institutions have evolved over time to meet the needs of the population. There are a wide variety of values and norms present in English society, which vary from region to region and from class to class.  English society is typically considered to be hierarchical, with a well-defined social hierarchy that is based on wealth, power, and social status. In general, the lower the social rank, the more power and privilege someone wields. English society is also patrilineal, meaning that family lineages are typically inherited through the father. This system of social organisation has advantages and disadvantages: it can confer advantages on members of families because they have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, but it can also create barriers to advancement for members of less privileged families.  English society is highly materialistic; people are often motivated by their pursuit of material wealth and power. English society is also tolerant of different lifestyles and religious beliefs, which contributes to its overall diversity. Although English society can be quite equalitarian in practice, it is often stratified in terms of wealth and power.

The French diaspora  consists of French people who have left France or who were born outside of France. It is the largest diaspora in the world, with an estimated population of over 700,000 people as of 2013.   The French diaspora can be found in all parts of the world, with the highest concentrations in Canada, the United States, and France itself. The French diaspora is a result of several factors, including the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. The French Revolution led to the separation of France from most of its former colonies and dependencies, and the Napoleonic Wars caused many French soldiers to be discharged from their armies and return home. This led to a large number of French people living abroad.   The French diaspora has had a significant impact on French culture and language. Many French people living abroad have brought back new traditions and expressions into the French language. Additionally, many new languages have been created in the French diaspora, such as Haitian Creole and Creole English.   The French diaspora is an important part of French history and culture. It has contributed to the development of many new languages and cultures, and has strengthened ties between France and its former colonies and dependencies.

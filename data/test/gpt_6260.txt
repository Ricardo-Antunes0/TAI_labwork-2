Carro Armato (armored vehicle) was the Italian word for an armored fighting vehicle. The word is derived from the Italian word "carro" meaning "cart" and the suffix "-armato" meaning "armed".  The first prototypes of armored vehicles were built in Italy in the early 1920s. The Italian Army was the first to extensively use armored vehicles in combat, using them in World War II. Many of the designs used in World War II were later used in the Cold War. Today, armored vehicles are still used by many armies around the world.

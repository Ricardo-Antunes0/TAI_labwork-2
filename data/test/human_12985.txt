Namchuncheon Station (Korean: 남춘천역, meaning South Chuncheon Station, Abbr:Kangwondae Station; 강원대역) is a train station on the Gyeongchun Line in Chuncheon, South Korea, operated by Korail. This station is 78.6 kilometres from its final western destination, Sangbong Station. History On July 20, 1939, this station had been operated as the name of Seongsan Station (성산역), however, on April 1, 1940, the name of station has been changed into Namchuncheon Station (남춘천역) and this name has been kept since then. On October 27, 1971, the old station (closed since December 21, 2010) has been built and it lasted almost 40 years. On September 30, 2005, with the kickoff of the construction of new twin-track electronic rapid transit system, this station has been used as the eastern terminus of old Gyeongchun Line, due to the suspension of using Chuncheon Station during that period, and it run successfully until December 20, 2010. A brand-new station has been built, and since December 21, 2010, this station starts operating as the gateway to Chuncheon city. This station is also called as 'Kangwondae Station' (강원대역), because the Chuncheon (primary) Campus of Kangwon National University nearly locates from this station.

al-Taliah al-Salafiyah al-Mujahediyah Ansar al-Sharia (English: Fighting Islamic Group of al-Taliah, al-Salafiyah, and Mujahediyah) is an Egyptian Islamic militant organization that has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union, and Egypt.  The group was founded in December 2011 by Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, the Blind Sheikh, who is currently serving a life sentence in the United States for his role in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The group initially focused its activities on attacking Egyptian military and police targets, but has since expanded its operations to include attacks on civilians and foreign targets in neighboring Libya and Syria.  Ansar al-Sharia is also known for its ties to al-Qaeda and for its participation in the Syrian Civil War on the side of the Syrian opposition. As of February 2019, the group is believed to have around 1,000 members.

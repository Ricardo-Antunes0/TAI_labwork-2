The Opel Crossland (known until 2020 as the Adam) is a small family car that was produced by the German automaker Opel from 1997 to 2002.  The Crossland was Opel's first attempt at a small family car in over twenty years, following the withdrawal of the Corsa in 1995. It was based on the platform of the Vauxhall Cavalier, and was launched at the 1997 Geneva Motor Show.  The Crossland was marketed as a competitor to the Ford Escort and Volkswagen Golf, and achieved some success in Europe, but failed to win over American buyers. The car was discontinued in 2002 after Opel decided to focus on larger models.

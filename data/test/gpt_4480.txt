The Task Force on Rebooting Computing (TFRC), established in 2014, is charged with providing a comprehensive report on the state of computing and recommending actions for the IEEE to take.  The Computing Revolution has dramatically changed our world. From personal computers to smartphones, technology has become ubiquitous. However, the architecture and design of computing systems has not kept pace with these changes, and todayâ€™s computing systems are struggling to meet modern demands.  The TFRC was formed to provide a comprehensive report on the state of computing and make recommendations for the IEEE to take. The task force will explore all aspects of computing, from hardware to software, and will identify challenges and opportunities facing the field of computing.  The TFRC will release its report in early 2019. In the meantime, please visit our website for more information.

The Dunbar Hotel, originally known as the Dunbar-Logan Hotel, is a historic hotel located in the West End of Glasgow, Scotland.  The Dunbar Hotel was officially opened on 15 May 1888 by the Earl of Dunbar. The architect was David Bryce and the engineer was William Leiper. The Dunbar was Glasgow's first luxury hotel and it quickly became one of the city's most popular tourist destinations. It remained an important landmark in the city until its closure in 1973.  The Dunbar has been restored and is now a luxury hotel once again.

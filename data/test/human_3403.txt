Victoria Leeds is a shopping and leisure area in Leeds city centre.  It combines the 1990 Victoria Quarter (an upmarket district of interconnected contemporary and restored Victorian shopping arcades) west of Vicar Lane and the 2016 Victoria Gate shopping centre east of Vicar Lane.  It includes a casino and major stores such as Harvey Nichols and John Lewis and Partners, and the largest stained glass work in Britain, by artist Brian Clarke. Victoria Quarter The Grade II* listed Victoria Quarter, known as 'the Knightsbridge of the North', is an upmarket network of interconnected shopping spaces covering three blocks between Briggate and Vicar Lane, comprising County Arcade, Cross Arcade, Queen Victoria Street (turned into an arcade in the 1989 redevelopment scheme through the pedestrianisation and glazing over of the street with what was at the time the largest secular stained glass work in the world) and King Edward Street. It opened as the Victoria Quarter in September 1990, and in 1991 was awarded both the Leeds Award for Architecture and the Civic Trust Award.

The Swiss locomotive class Ae 4/6 was a class of electric locomotives. They were intended as a powerful locomotive for the steep gradients of the Gotthard Railway, but smaller than the huge 'double locomotives' which had previously been tested there. They were built from 1941, during World War II, and although Switzerland remained neutral through this, material shortages led to some quality problems with these locomotives. Origins  The SBB Ae 4/6 was needed for service on the steep gradients of the Gotthard Railway. Electric locomotives were needed, rather than steam, both because of Switzerland's dependence on imported coal, and also because of the ventilation problems in long tunnels. Existing electric types, such as the Ce 6/8I, Ce 6/8II 'crocodiles' and the Be 4/6 of the early 1920s had been powerful enough for the gradients, but their use of a coupling rod drive limited their speed. A new express passenger locomotive would require independent traction motors for each axle.

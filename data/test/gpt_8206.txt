Buise was one of the East Frisian Islands of the German North Sea Coast, located in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. The island had a population of 143 in 2006.  The island was first mentioned as "Buzin" in a document from 1040. The name may derive from the Old Frisian word "buzin" meaning "pile". The island was acquired by the Dutch East India Company in 1609, who built a fort there. In 1814 it became part of the Kingdom of Prussia.   In 1946, Buise was ceded to the newly formed state of Schleswig-Holstein. In 1957, it became part of the district Güstrow. In 1975, Buise and six other islands were merged into the new municipality of Föhr.   The island is now uninhabited.

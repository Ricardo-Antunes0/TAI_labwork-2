(in Medieval Latin, corresponding to Old English þēodisc, Old High German  diutisc and other early Germanic reflexes of Proto-Germanic *þiudiskaz, meaning "popular" or "of the people") was a term used in the early Middle Ages to refer to the West Germanic languages. The Latin term was borrowed from the Germanic adjective meaning "of the people" but, unlike it, was used only to refer to languages. In Medieval Western Europe non-native Latin was the language of science, church and administration, hence Latin theodiscus and its Germanic counterparts were used as antonyms of Latin, to refer to the "native language spoken by the general populace". They were subsequently used in the Frankish Empire to denote the native Germanic vernaculars. As such, they were no longer used as antonym of Latin, but of walhisk, a language descendant from Latin, but nevertheless the speech of the general populace as well. In doing so Latin theodiscus and the Germanic reflexes of  effectively obtained the meaning of "Germanic", or more specifically one of its local varieties – resulting in the English exonym "", the German endonym , the modern Dutch word for "German", , and older Dutch words for Dutch and German and their dialects , and Duuts. In Romance languages the same word yielded the Italian word for "German", , and the old French word used for Dutch or, depending on the locality, German speakers, . Etymology Theodiscus is derived from West Germanic *þiudisk, from Proto-Germanic . The stem of this word, , meant "people" in Proto-Germanic, and  was an adjective-forming suffix, of which  is the Modern English cognate with the same meaning. The Proto-Indo-European word  ("tribe", "people"), which is commonly reconstructed as the basis of the word, is related to Lithuanian  ("nation"), Old Irish  ("tribe", "people") and Oscan touto ("community").

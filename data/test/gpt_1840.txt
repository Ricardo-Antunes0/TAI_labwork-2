Elmyr de Hory (born Elemér Albert Hoffmann; October 14, 1905 – November 2, 1986) was a Hungarian-born French painter and printmaker.  Hoffmann was born in Budapest, Hungary, the son of the art historian and collector Albert Hoffmann. After studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest, he moved to Paris in 1926 and began to exhibit his work. He became associated with the Surrealist movement, and his paintings often featured dreamlike images and bizarre elements. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, he produced a series of paintings depicting scenes from French life. He later returned to Hungary, where he continued to produce art until his death in 1986.

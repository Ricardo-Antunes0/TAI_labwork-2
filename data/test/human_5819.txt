Southern Gravity is the debut solo studio album by American country music singer Kristian Bush, one half of the duo Sugarland. It was released on April 7, 2015 via Streamsound Records Content Bush revealed the track list and title of the album on January 28, 2015. In an interview with Rolling Stone, he said, "I want people to go, 'I had no idea!' Using my voice is something I've shied away from, and I can't believe what a tool it is." Jon Freeman of Country Weekly described the album's content as "a remarkably positive albumâ€¦with only 'House on the Beach' alluding to an air of exhaustion and 'Feeling Fine California' occurring in the bewildering in the aftermath of a breakup. In large part, the songs are as sunny and personable as the man who wrote and recorded them." Marrissa Moss of Rolling Stone noted influences of Steve Earle, Zac Brown Band, and Jason Mraz in Bush's work for the album.

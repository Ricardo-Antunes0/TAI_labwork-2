Wilhelmina Wendt (8 August 1896 – 26 June 1988), commonly known as Tiddit, was a Swedish silversmith. She was the first woman in Sweden to be granted the title of "master silversmith". From the late 1920s, she designed trays, serving dishes, bowls, jugs and jewellery. In the mid 1940s, she settled in  Perstorp where she combined her father's black insulation material "isolit" with her own thin silver designs, producing artefacts in what she called "silverisolit". Biography Born in Perstorp on 8 August 1896, Wilhelmina Wendt was the daughter of the engineer and factory owner Wilhelm Wendt and his wife Minna née Pauly. She was the fifth child in a family of 12. Disliking her given name, she called herself Tiddit or Tittit. Like her siblings, she attended schools in Helsingborg and Kristianstad. After being inspired by the designer Per Torndahl who had installed lighting in her father's factory, she moved to Stockholm where she attended the College of Arts, Crafts and Design.

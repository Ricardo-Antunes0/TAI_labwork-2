Blas de Prado, or Del Prado, was a Spanish composer, singer and musician of the early 18th century.  Born in Madrid in 1683, Blas de Prado was the son of a vintner. He began his musical training at an early age, and made his public debut in 1698 as a singer in the company of Gaspar de Vega. In 1702 he was appointed maestro de capilla of the Royal Chapel of El Pardo, becoming its director in 1708. He remained at this post until his death in 1748.   De Prado is chiefly remembered for his operas, most of which were written for the royal court and published mainly during his lifetime. These include "Elisabeth", "Don Carlos", "Zaragoza", "Elisabetta d'Este", and "Por una cabeza". He also composed religious music, including masses and motets.

The British Aircraft Company was a British aircraft manufacturer.  The British Aircraft Company was founded at the end of World War I by engineer and aviator Sir Robert J. Smyth-Smyth with financial backing from entrepreneur Lord Northcliffe. The company initially produced aircraft components for the military, but soon began producing complete aircraft. In 1920, the company became a limited company and changed its name to the British Aircraft Corporation. In 1928, it merged with Vickers Limited to form the British Aviation Corporation. In 1938, the corporation was nationalized as part of Britain's war effort and became known as the Royal Air Force's Aircraft Production Board. The board was dissolved in 1945 and the corporation was privatized. It was later renamed British Aerospace Corporation.  In 1986, BAe sold its aircraft and spacecraft divisions to McDonnell Douglas, which in turn sold them to Boeing in 1997. The company's commercial aerospace division became part of BAE Systems plc in 1999. In 2000, BAE Systems acquired Alenia Aermacchi, a leading European aerospace manufacturer.   Today, the company is a major defence and security contractor, with activities including design, development, manufacture and sales of aircraft, missiles and defence systems; support to military operations; provision of services including training and logistics; and development of new technologies.

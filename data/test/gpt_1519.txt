Berliner Thor- und Fußballclub Elf 1900 was a German association football club from the city of Berlin.  Formed in 1900, the club played in the Bezirksliga Berlin-Brandenburg until 1957, when it dropped down to the Amateurliga Berlin. After a single season in this league, Elf won promotion to the Landesliga Berlin-Brandenburg, where it played until 1969. The next year, it slipped back to the Amateurliga, but returned to the Landesliga in 1974. In 1978, Elf merged with Sportfreunde Staaken and FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt to form FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt/Elf, which played in the Oberliga Nord until 1988. The club then dropped down again to the Verbandsliga Berlin (III) and played there until 1997. It then withdrew from competition.  The club's honours include two Amateurliga titles in 1936 and 1951 as well as two Landesliga titles in 1969 and 1974.

Paschase Broët (1500?- 14 September 1562) was a Catholic priest, and one of the first Jesuits. Early life and priesthood Broët was born in the town of Bertrancourt, Picardy around 1500. Broët was one of six children of a wealthy farmer who was in a position to provide for his son's education as a priest. He was ordained a priest on March 12, 1524, but his father's generosity meant that he could live titulo patrimonii which meant he would live off a patrimony rather than have his living provided for by a parish (sub titulo). he remained in Picardy until at least 1532. Between 1532 and 1533 he started his studies at the University of Paris. It's known that he was a member of the faculty of Arts where he studied philosophy and he resided at the Collège de Calvi. Three years later he received his licentiate alongside Simão Rodrigues and Jean Codure. It was around this time that along with Rodrigues he came into contact with Peter Faber who introduced him to Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola. On 15 August 1536 along with Codure they bound themselves with the same vows that the original seven Jesuits took while at the same time those original members still in Paris renewed their vows. Claude Jay had joined the previous year so Codure and Broet brought the number to ten.

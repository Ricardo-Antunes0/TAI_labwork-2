A mansion is a large dwelling house. The term is also applied to large houses not traditionally classified as mansions, such as country houses, palaces, and stately homes.  Mansions are typically found in areas with high incomes and a high level of luxury. They are typically composed of several buildings, including at least one main building or mansion, with outbuildings used for agricultural purposes, servants quarters, a chapel, a greenhouse, and a garden.

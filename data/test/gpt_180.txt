In finance, a dual currency deposit (DCD, also known as a two-currency deposit) is a financial product that allows depositors to hold two currencies, typically Euros and US Dollars, simultaneously in their account. The product is usually offered by banks and other financial institutions.  The main benefits of a DCD are that the depositor can earn an interest rate on both currencies and the money is kept separate in the event of a currency crisis or exchange rate fluctuation. The risk of the DCD product is that if one currency decreases in value relative to the other, the deposited money may become worth less.

In Buddhist texts, Sumedha is a previous incarnation of the Buddha. As a bodhisattva, Sumedha practices extreme asceticism and is said to have attained enlightenment while in a state of permanent meditative absorption.  Born in the city of Kapilavastu, Sumedha became a renunciate at the age of thirteen after witnessing his father's death. After six years of asceticism and meditation, he attained enlightenment under a bodhi tree. He then traveled throughout India teaching the doctrine of karma and the path to enlightenment.  Sumedha is venerated as a saint in Buddhism and is often depicted with a begging bowl. He is also known by various epithets such as "The Gentle One" or "The Enlightened One."

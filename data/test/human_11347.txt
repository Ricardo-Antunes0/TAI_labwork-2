The Wedgwood Institute is a large red-brick building that stands in Queen Street, in the town of Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England.   It is sometimes called the Wedgwood Memorial Institute, but it is not to be confused with the former Wedgwood Memorial College in Barlaston.  It achieved listed building status (grade II starred) in 1972. Construction and opening The Wedgwood Institute was funded entirely by public subscription from 1859 onward, the estimated cost at the time being Â£4,000, and was constructed between 1863 and 1869. It was named after the potter Josiah Wedgwood, and it stands on the site of the former Brick House pottery works which Wedgwood had rented from 1762 to 1770. Brick House was the second of his pottery works in the town of Burslem, the first being at the Ivy House works.  A small part of the old works was incorporated into the fabric of the new Institute.

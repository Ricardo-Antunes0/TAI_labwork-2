Colin Black is an Australian experimental music composer and multi-instrumentalist. He is known for his minimalist compositions and arrangements, which often explore complex rhythmic structures and dissonant sounds.  Colin Black was born in Sydney, Australia in 1966. He began playing the guitar at a young age, and later learned to play the drums, piano, bass guitar, and various other instruments. In 1984, he formed the experimental music group Prayers for Rain with fellow musicians Mick Turner and David Golightly. The group released two albums before disbanding in 1987.   Black began working on solo projects in the late 1980s, releasing his first album, Music for Airports, in 1990. He continued to release albums throughout the 1990s and 2000s, including 2004's Serene Velocity. His most recent album, Asleep in the Deep Blue Sea, was released in 2017.

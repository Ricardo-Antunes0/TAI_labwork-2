Manuel Y. Ferrer was regarded during his lifetime as the preeminent scholar of Latin American history. He was a prolific writer and his many works on the subject are still highly respected.  Ferrer was born in 1881 in the city of Orense, Galicia, in northwestern Spain. After completing his studies at the University of Santiago de Compostela, he began work as a professor of Spanish literature at the University of Buenos Aires in 1910. Two years later he moved to Mexico City, where he became a professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). He also served as the president of that institution from 1928 to 1946.  Ferrer is best known for his monumental work Historia general de America, which was published in twelve editions between 1930 and 1966. The book covers the history of North and South America from pre-colonial times to the present day, and is considered a cornerstone of Latin American historiography. Ferrer also wrote numerous other books on Latin American history, including Los hombres que hicieron la historia de America (1930), La América Latina en el siglo XIX (1935), La América Latina en el siglo XX (1940), and El problema latinoamericano (1960).  Ferrer died in Mexico City in 1966. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1955, and has been designated a National Hero of Mexico by presidential decree.

The Mill at Anselma (a.k.a. Lightfoot Mill) is an archetypal small, 18th century custom grain mill in Anselma, outside Chester Springs, Pennsylvania.  It is probably the only surviving one in the United States with an intact colonial-era power transmission system.  A custom grain mill typically ground cornmeal and flour only for local farmers, not for commercial distribution.  It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2005. History of the Mill at Anselma Samuel Lightfoot built this custom grist mill in c. 1747 to mill flour for Chester Springs' early residents.  During three centuries of operation, the Mill evolved to meet changing needs and became the center of the community of Anselma.  The first of eight grist mills established in the Township of Pikeland, the Mill at Anselma was never the largest nor the most valuable.  However, it provided a vital local flour milling service for early settlers living in Philadelphia's backcountry against the backdrop of a flourishing American grain economy in the late 18th century.

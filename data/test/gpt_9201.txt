An exciton is a bound state of an electron and a positron. In the most common form, an exciton is a two-particle system: an electron and a positron that are tightly bound to each other, sharing a quantum mechanical state called an excitation energy.  In quantum mechanics, an exciton is a bound state of an electron and a positron. In the most common form, an exciton is a two-particle system: an electron and a positron that are tightly bound to each other, sharing a quantum mechanical state called an excitation energy. The binding energy of an exciton is the minimum amount of energy required to break the bond between the two particles.  An exciton can exist in many different configurations, including in pairs (a "pair-state"), triplets (a "triplet-state"), or higher order multiplet states. The most common form of an exciton is a two-particle system: an electron and a positron that are tightly bound to each other, sharing a quantum mechanical state called an excitation energy.  The binding energy of an exciton is the minimum amount of energy required to break the bond between the two particles. When excited by light, an electron in an excited state will move to a lower energy state, while the positron will move to a higher energy state. The total energy of the system will be equal to the difference between the two energies of the individual particles: the sum of the energies of the electron

Domhnall Ua Buachalla (; ; 3 February 1866 – 30 October 1963) was an Irish politician and member of the First Dáil who served as third and final governor-general of the Irish Free State and later served as a member of the Council of State. Early life Ua Buachalla was born in Maynooth in County Kildare on 3 February 1866. His birth was registered as Daniel, the son of Cornelius Buckley, a shopkeeper, and Sarah Buckley, née Jacob. He married Sinéad Walsh in Dolphin's Barn, Dublin on 3 June 1897. After his marriage, he and his family lived in Maynooth, where he ran a combined grocery, bicycle shop and pub in the town. He was an Irish language activist and member of Conradh na Gaeilge. In 1907, he was arrested and had his groceries seized when he refused to pay a fine for having his grocery wagon painted with Domhnall Ua Buachalla (his name in the Irish language), as British law required grocery wagons to be registered only in the English language.

Nicholas Albert Reale (March 20, 1922 â€“ November 18, 1984) was a prominent American watercolorist with a lengthy career in art and teaching. Reale's works have been exhibited throughout the United States and Canada, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The recipient of more than 60 major awards, he is listed in Who's Who in American Art. His works are in the permanent collections of the National Academy of Design, Newark Museum NJ, the Jersey City Museum, the University of Arizona, and Monmouth University. Born in Irvington, New Jersey, his parents emigrated from southern Italy in the early 20th century, and Reale attended Newark Arts High School in Newark, New Jersey, where he eventually joined the faculty.  He was directed to the Arts High School by a biology teacher in the public schools, who had noticed his exceptional sketches in the margins of his science assignments and encouraged him to transfer schools. Upon graduation Reale enrolled in the Pratt Institute, Brooklyn.

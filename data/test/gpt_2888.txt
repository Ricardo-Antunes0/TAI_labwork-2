Cassation is a minor musical genre related to post-classical neo-baroque. It usually features a melancholic, introspective tone, and is characterised by a more subdued and somber use of melodic and harmonic elements than is typical of the classical Baroque period.  Cassation is related to the Baroque era, which spanned from the early 1600s to the late 18th century. The classical Baroque period was characterized by a more ornate use of melody and harmony, as well as more dramatic and bombastic orchestral effects. Cassation, in contrast, is characterized by a more subdued and somber tone, as well as a more subdued and subtle use of melody and harmony. This quieter style is sometimes referred to as "luminosity" or "sheen".  Cassation is sometimes associated with the Romantic period, which began in the late 18th century and lasted until the early 20th century. Romanticism was a movement that emphasized emotion over logic, feeling over reason, and nature over culture. Because of this, Cassation often features emotional themes and lyrics inspired by romantic poetry.

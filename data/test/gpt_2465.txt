Slavic paganism or Slavic religion describes the religious practices of the Slavic people before their conversion to Christianity in the 7th century. While paganism was never entirely extinguished among the Slavic peoples, it was supplanted by Christianity beginning in the 8th century.  Slavic paganism was a polytheistic religion that revered a variety of gods and goddesses, many of which were similar to those worshiped by the Germanic peoples. Its adherents believed that these deities could help them achieve success in life and ward off evil. Some of the most important Slavic pagan deities were Perun, Svante, Veles, and Dazhbog.  The Slavs were originally nomadic people who lived in present-day Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine, and Russia. In the 6th century, they began to settle down and adopt Christianity. As a result, their pagan beliefs gradually disappeared. Today, traces of Slavic paganism can be found only in folklore and religious ceremonies.

Andrea Chung (born 1978) is an American artist born in Newark, NJ and currently works in San Diego, CA. Her work focuses primarily on island nations in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean sea; specifically on how outsiders perceive a fantastic reality in spaces deemed as “paradise”. In conjunction, she explores relationships between these cultures, migration, and labor - all within the context of colonial and postcolonial regimes. Her projects bring in conscientious elements of her own labor and incorporate materials significant to the cultures she studies. This can be seen in works such as, “Bato Disik”, displayed in 2013 at the Helmuth Projects, where the medium of sugar represents the legacy of sugar plantations and colonial regime. Biography  Chung was born to parents of Jamaican/Chinese and Trinidadian descent. She was raised in Houston, TX. Chung received her BFA in Illustration from the Parsons School of Design in New York and her MFA from the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore in 2008. After her graduation from MICA, she received a Fulbright Fellowship to study in Mauritius where she created the performance work Securicorp, a response to the problem of street harassment. She also attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in 2008 and was the 2012 resident at the Headlands Center for the Arts and a 2013 Artist-in-Residence at the McColl Center for Art + Innovation in Charlotte, NC. Chung's artwork is found in the collections of Harvard University, University of Texas, and the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, among others.

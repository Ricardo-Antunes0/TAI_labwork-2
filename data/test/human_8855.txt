Huntington Prep or Huntington St. Joseph Prep is a basketball-focused college preparatory school located in Huntington, West Virginia. It was founded in 2009 by head coach Rob Fulford and his staff. Huntington Prep was originally unrelated to the public Huntington High School located in the same city, though now Huntington Prep players go to school at Huntington High after Huntington Prep's host relationship with St. Joseph Central Catholic High School ended in 2020. School Huntington Prep was originally housed within St. Joseph Central Catholic High School, a religious school, but in 2020 ended that relationship. The students were regular St. Joseph's students and had to abide by the rules and regulations of the high school. After becoming an accepted part of the school, Huntington Prep became Huntington St. Joseph Prep (even wearing the St. Joe emblem on the uniforms). Since 2021, Huntington Prep became part of Cabell County Schools after they moved host schools to Huntington High School.

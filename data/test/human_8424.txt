Nomothetic and idiographic are terms used by Neo-Kantian philosopher Wilhelm Windelband to describe two distinct approaches to knowledge, each one corresponding to a different intellectual tendency, and each one corresponding to a different branch of academia. To say that Windelband never supported that last dichotomy which is a consequent misunderstanding of his own thought. He was clear saying the any branch of science and any discipline can be handled by both methods as they offer two integrating points of view.  Nomothetic is based on what Kant described as a tendency to generalize, and is typical for the natural sciences.  It describes the effort to derive laws that explain types or categories of objective phenomena, in general.  Idiographic is based on what Kant described as a tendency to specify, and is typical for the humanities. It describes the effort to understand the meaning of contingent, unique, and often cultural or subjective phenomena.

Linda Medlar-Jones (born 1949) was a principal figure in a high-profile political sex scandal that triggered an exhaustive 2 Â½ year, multimillion-dollar investigation by the U.S. Office of the Independent Counsel during the first term of U.S. President Bill Clinton. The principal target of the investigation was her former lover, Housing and Urban Development secretary Henry Gabriel Cisneros of San Antonio, Texas. The illicit relationship between Medlar and Cisneros, who were both married at the time, began in 1987 while he was Mayor of San Antonio, and she was a volunteer Mayoral campaign staffer.  Medlar, who according to court documents had a long history of mental illness, secretly recorded many of her telephone conversations with Cisneros.  These recordings she later sold to the television program Inside Edition for the sum $15,000.  In 1994, Medlar entered a lawsuit for $250,000 against Cisneros, accusing him of fraud, breach of contract, and failure to support her.  This lawsuit was settled the following year for $49,000.

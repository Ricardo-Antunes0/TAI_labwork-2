The Avoca Homestead Complex is a heritage-listed complex of historic buildings and outbuildings at Avoca, City of Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. The complex is also known as Avoca Farm and Avoca House. It was added to the Victorian Heritage Register on 2 April 2000.  The site is believed to have been first settled by the McArthur family in the 1840s. In 1851, James Millar purchased a section of land from the McArthur family and began operating a flour mill on the site. In 1861, he erected a two-storey house on the property which he named "Avoca" after his birthplace in County Donegal, Ireland. The mill was destroyed by fire in 1870, but the house remained in use as a residence until 1951.  The house and outbuildings were acquired by the Ballarat Heritage Trust in 1981 and restored to their original condition. The complex now houses a museum which displays items from the Millar and McArthur families as well as artefacts from the Ballarat goldfields.

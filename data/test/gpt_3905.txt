Telephone was a sternwheel-driven steamboat built in 1892 by the Western Shipbuilding Company at their yard in San Francisco. She was the first steamboat built for Transcontinental and Pacific Railway service, and was designed to carry passengers and cargo between San Francisco and Seattle.   The Telephone operated for only a few years before being replaced by larger vessels. Today, only a small section of the bow of her original hull remains in San Francisco Bay.

BlackBerry Passport is a smartphone developed by BlackBerry Limited. Officially released on October 24, 2014, the Passport is inspired by its namesake and incorporates features designed to make the device attractive to enterprise users, such as a unique square-shaped display measuring 4.5 inches diagonally, a compact physical keyboard with touchpad gestures, and the latest release of the company's BlackBerry 10 operating system. Reception to the Passport was mixed; critics praised the quality of the device's design, screen, and keyboard for meeting the company's goals of creating a business-oriented device, along with an improved application selection through the integration of Amazon's Appstore for Android (taking advantage of the Android software support provided by BlackBerry 10) alongside BlackBerry's own store for native software. Criticism of the Passport was focused primarily on its irregular form factor, with its width being even wider than most phablet smartphones, making the device difficult to carry and use one-handed due to its increased width, while its keyboard was criticized for having made a subtle but perceptible layout change in comparison to past BlackBerry devices.

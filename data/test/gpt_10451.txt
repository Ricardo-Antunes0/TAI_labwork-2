James Emanuel Fuchs (pronounced ; December 6, 1933 â€“ May 1, 2017) was an American mathematician who made significant contributions to the theory of groups and lattices.  Fuchs was born in New York City and earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan in 1954. He then received his PhD from Princeton University in 1958 under the supervision of David Mumford. He spent most of his career at the University of California, Berkeley, where he served as a professor until his retirement in 2002.  Fuchs is best known for his work on lattices and groups, particularly their intersection and covering properties. He also developed the Fuchsian theorem, which is a key tool in the study of lattices and groups. Fuchs was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1984 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992.

The Royal Shrovetide Football Match is a traditional football match played on Shrove Tuesday at the Queen's Park in London. The match is traditionally contested by two teams, the Royal Shrovetide Football Club and the opposing Hospitals Football Club, although there have been exceptions.  The game is played on a large pitch in front of a large crowd of spectators, and typically lasts for 90 minutes. The game is refereed by a professional referee, and is usually followed by a grand final.  The Royal Shrovetide Football Match has a long history, and has been played at the Queen's Park since at least 1820. The first recorded match was between the Royal Shrovetide Football Club and the Hospitals Football Club, and was won by the Royal Shrovetide Football Club 3â€“2. Since then, the game has become increasingly popular, and now typically draws crowds of around 5,000 spectators.  The Royal Shrovetide Football Match is considered to be a traditional part of British culture, and has been described as "a national institution". The game is often used as an opportunity to raise money for charity, and has been responsible for raising millions of pounds for charity over the years.

The Aurora mine is the largest integrated gold and silver mine in Canada. It is located in the Tahltan Regional District, about northeast of Quesnel, British Columbia. The mine has reserves of 243 million ounces of gold and 1.7 billion ounces of silver.   Although gold and silver prices have declined since the peak of the mining boom in 2012, Aurora remains one of the most profitable mines in the world. The mine has employed approximately 2,000 people since operations began in 1984, and generated over C$1.5 billion in economic activity. In 2018, Aurora announced that it would be selling its remaining gold and silver production to a subsidiary of Anglo American plc for C$1.48 billion, marking the end of more than three decades of mining at the site.

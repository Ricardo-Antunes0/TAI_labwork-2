Robert Christian Hansen (February 15, 1939 – August 21, 2014), known in the media as the Butcher Baker, was an American serial killer. Between 1971 and 1983, Hansen abducted, raped, and murdered at least seventeen women in and around Anchorage, Alaska; he hunted many of them down in the wilderness with a Ruger Mini-14 and a knife. He was arrested and convicted in 1983, and was sentenced to 461 years without the possibility of parole. He died in 2014 of natural causes due to lingering health conditions at age 75. Early life Robert Hansen was born in Estherville, Iowa, on February 15, 1939, the son of Danish immigrant father Christian R. Hansen (1907-1983) and American mother Edna Margret (née Pedersen) Hansen (1916-2005). The family moved to California in 1942, but returned to Iowa in 1949, settling in Pocahontas. Christian Hansen owned a bakery in the town, and Robert was employed at the bakery. In his youth, he was painfully shy, afflicted with a stutter and severe acne that left him permanently scarred. Not receiving the attention he wanted from the attractive girls in school, Hansen grew up hating them and nursing fantasies of cruel revenge.

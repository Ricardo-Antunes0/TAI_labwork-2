Official Languages Commission is an Indian commission established in 1956 to promote the use of Hindi and English in India. The commission is headquartered in New Delhi.  The establishment of the Official Languages Commission was proposed by the Constituent Assembly in its Fourth Schedule, which envisaged the creation of a Commission to protect and promote the use of Hindi and English in India. The commission was formally established on 8 January 1956, with Professor Rajendra Prasad as its first chairman.  The commission's objectives are enshrined in the Constitution of India, which states that it shall "promote the use of Hindi and English throughout India, and shall endeavor to provide for their promotion by all means within its powers". In addition, the commission is mandated to "promote the teaching of Hindi and English in all educational institutions within India" and to "advise the Government on all matters relating to the use of Hindi and English".  The commission has played an important role in the development of Hindi and English language policies in India. It has also undertaken a number of projects aimed at promoting Hindi and English language usage. These projects have included the development of textbooks for use in primary and secondary schools, the establishment of radio stations devoted to broadcasting in Hindi and English, and the promotion of Hindi language films.  The commission is headed by a chairman, who is appointed by the President of India on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. The current chairman is Linguist Ram Nath Kovind.

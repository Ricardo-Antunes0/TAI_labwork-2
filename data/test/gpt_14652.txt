SMS Erzherzog Albrecht was an ironclad warship of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. She was named after Archduke Albrecht, the son of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. She was laid down in 1892 and launched in 1895. She was armed with a main battery of four guns and had a crew of 727 officers and men.  SMS Erzherzog Albrecht spent her entire career in the Austro-Hungarian Navy, serving during both World War I and World War II. She engaged in several major battles during both wars, including the Battle of Jutland in 1916 and the Battle of the River Plate in December 1939. After being damaged in a bomb raid on Trieste in 1944, she was scrapped five years later.

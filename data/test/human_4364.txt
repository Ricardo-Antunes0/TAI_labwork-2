Panic selling is a wide-scale selling of an investment which causes a sharp decline in prices. Specifically, an investor wants to sell an investment with little regard to the price obtained. The sale is problematic because the investor is reacting to emotion and fear, rather than evaluating the fundamentals. Most major stock exchanges use trading curbs to throttle panic selling, providing a cooling period for people to digest information related to the selling and restore some degree of normality to the market. Causes of panic The panic is typically the "fear that the market for a particular industry, or in general, will decline, causing additional losses." In event of panic selling, the market is flooded with securities, properties or commodities that are being sold at lower prices, in which further stumbles prices and induces more selling. Common causes of panic selling are:  High speculation in market (e.g. Dubai's Housing Crash in 2009)  Economic instability (e.g. The Financial Crisis in 2008)  Political issues

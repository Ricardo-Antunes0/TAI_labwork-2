Godwick is a deserted village in the Mendip Hills, Somerset, England. It is situated about 3 miles (5 km) north-west of Shepton Mallet and about the same distance south-east of Cheddar.  Godwick was once a thriving village with a population of around 300. However, by the early 21st century, it had dwindled to a small number of residents, living mainly in retirement. The village is now largely deserted and has been left to decay.  The name Godwick is thought to derive from the Old English word "godwīc" meaning a 'gift of God'.

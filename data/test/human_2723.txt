Raging Silence is the 17th album by British Rock group Uriah Heep. It marked the studio debut of Canadian vocalist Bernie Shaw and keyboardist Phil Lanzon, both of whom have remained with the band since. It was produced by Richard Dodd and the title is an allusion to the Manfred Mann's Earth Band album The Roaring Silence (1976). It was the first Uriah Heep studio album to have a contemporary release on CD. It opens with the old Argent hit "Hold Your Head Up", although Mick Box was pleased to be able to add a guitar solo. This track was the lead single from the album. The second single was "Blood Red Roses", written by the band's erstwhile vocalist Pete Goalby. The 7" came as a poster-sleeve (UK cat. Legacy LGY 101) and had "Rough Justice" as the B-side. The 12" p/s came with a patch and also added a previously unavailable live version of "Look at Yourself" (UK cat. Legacy LGYT 101). The original vinyl had the lyrics on the inner-bag.

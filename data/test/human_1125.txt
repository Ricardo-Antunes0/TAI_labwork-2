My Dream Boat (foaled 17 April 2012) is an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse best known for his upset victory in the 2016 Prince of Wales's Stakes. As a two-year-old in 2014 he showed promise but failed to win in three races. In the following year he made steady progress, winning two handicap races before moving up in class in the autumn to win the Listed Prix du Ranelagh and the Group Three Prix Perth. He improved again when campaigned over longer distances as a four-year-old, taking the Gordon Richards Stakes in April and then defeating a world-class field in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. Background My Dream Boat is a bay horse with no white markings bred in Ireland by Patrick Monahan. Having been withdrawn from sale as a foal in November 2012, the colt was put up for auction at Goffs as a yearling in February 2013 and was sold for €3,500 to Patrick Moyles. My Dream Boat was offered for sale at Goffs again in October 2013 and attracted rather more interest, being bought for €16,000 by Shanavill Stables. In April 2014 the colt appeared at Doncaster in a "breeze-up" sale (one in which the horses are publicly galloped before being auctioned). He was bought for £40,000 by the trainer Donald McCain in partnership with Tom Malone. My Dream Boat entered the ownership of Paul and Claire Rooney and was taken into training with McCain at Cholmondeley in Cheshire.

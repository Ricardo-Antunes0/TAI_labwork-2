Dryandra subg. Dryandra is an obsolete clade of plant. It was a series within the former genus Dryandra (now Banksia ser. Dryandra). The name was first published at sectional rank as Dryandra verae in 1830, before being renamed Eudryandra in 1847, the replaced by the autonym at subgenus rank in 1996. It was ultimately discarded in 2007 when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele sunk Dryandra into Banksia. Brown's Dryandra verae Dryandra verae ("True Dryandra") was published by Brown in his 1830 Supplementum primum Prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae. Brown's arrangement of Dryandra split a single species out into a separate genus, and divided the remaining Dryandra species into three groups according to what Brown perceived to be variations in the number of seed separators. He allowed for these groups to be treated at subgenus or section rank, but they are now treated as having been published as sections. Dryandra verae was defined as containing those species with a single seed separator per follicle. Its placement and circumscription may be summarised as follows: Dryandra (now B. ser. Dryandra) Dryandra verae D. floribunda (now B. sessilis) D. cuneata (now B. obovata) D. armata (now B. armata) D. Serra (now B. serra) D. concinna (now B. concinna) D. foliolata (now B. foliolata) D. squarrosa (now B. squarrosa) D. formosa (now B. formosa) D. mucronulata (now B. mucronulata) D. Baxteri (now B. biterax) D. plumosa (now B. plumosa) D. obtusa (now B. obtusa) D. arctotidis (now B. arctotidis) D. nivea (now B. nivea) D. Fraseri (now B. fraseri) D. longifolia (now B. prolata) D. seneciifolia (now B. seneciifolia) D. tenuifolia (now B. tenuis) D. sect. Diplophragma (1 species) D. sect. Aphragma (4 species) Hemiclidia (1 species)

Survivor Japan: Philippines, was the third season of the Japanese version of the reality television show Survivor. The season was filmed from April 23 to May 7, 2006 in Palawan, Philippines.  The castaways were divided into two tribes, Luzon and Visayas, based on their regional origins. The Luzon tribe consisted of six players: a doctor, a businesswoman, a construction worker, a law student, and a truck driver. The Visayas tribe consisted of five players: a basketball coach, a nurse, a security guard, an advertising saleswoman, and a small-time criminal.  After losing the first Immunity Challenge (a 4-legged race), the Luzon tribe lost another member when the law student was voted out. At the next Tribal Council, the small-time criminal was voted out after she was caught in possession of a Hidden Immunity Idol. The Visayas tribe then won the next Immunity Challenge (a balance beam) and kept its five members.  The Luzon tribe lost two more members in succession at the next Tribal Councils: the basketball coach and the truck driver. The construction worker then became the Sole Survivor after winning three consecutive Immunity Challenges (a physical challenge and two mental challenges).

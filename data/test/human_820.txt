Vilija  was a manufacturing company based in Vilnius. It was established in 1911 and produced agricultural iron tools such as ploughs and harrows. It was the first larger enterprise established in Vilnius by Lithuanians. The factory permanently ceased operations in July 1920. Background Engineer Petras Vileišis established an ironwork workshop in 1900. It produced various industrial items (cisterns, caissons, parts for iron bridges, railroad switches, etc.) and smaller consumer products (fences, memorial crosses, lanterns, etc.). Majority of its business came from Russian government contracts. Its larger projects included the metal framework for the  and the decorative elements for the Vileišis Palace. It employed almost exclusively Lithuanian workers. It was located near the Vilnius Railway Station (present-day Paneriai Street) and had its own railway connection to transport the heavy products. In 1906, Jonas Basanavičius lent 19,000 rubles to Vileišis who offered his workshop as a security. Vileišis faced financial difficulties and had to sell the workshop which became the basis of the Vilija factory.

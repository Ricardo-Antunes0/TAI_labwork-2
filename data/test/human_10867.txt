HackFwd was a German pre-seed company started in 2010 by Lars Hinrichs. HackFwd only  planned to invest in developers with prototypes or demos for a fixed timeframe of 12 months. The timeframe was used to get to beta and create a viable business case. HackFwd claimed to provide a support structure doing all administrative work helping with finding advisors. Of the 30% equity stake that HackFwd takes, 3% were given back to the founders to distribute to advisors and mentors. HackFwd's headquarters were in Hamburg and the company intended to invest across Europe. HackFwd provided funding to startups of one to three people for a year. As of early 2011 funding ranged from  91,000 EUR to 191,000 EUR depending on the size of the founding team. The investment sizes are fixed and detailed on the website. HackFwd differed from many accelerators and incubators in that the startups invested in did not move to central location. Instead, they run quarterly events (called Build events) where all HackFwd members come together for feedback and expert mentorship sessions, which were designed to offer the most relevant support to startups in different phases of the program. Some of the material from the Build events were made public on the Where Passion Meets Momentum video website.

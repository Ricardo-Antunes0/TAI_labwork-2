Vein is the thirteenth album by Japanese rock band Boris, released on March 31, 2017.  Following the release of their twelfth album "New World", vocalist and primary songwriter Tetsuya Komuro took a break from the band in order to focus on his solo career. Guitarist and main songwriter Hiro Fujiwara also underwent surgery for cancer in late 2016, which put the finishing touches on the recording of this album.  The album's title is a reference to Russian poet and playwright Anton Chekhov's short story "Veins" (1890), which tells the story of a man who is unsure of his place in the world and has trouble coping with life. The album's sound was described as more introspective than their previous work, with Komuro singing about "self-doubt, insecurity, and loneliness."  The album was well-received by music critics, with many praising Komuro's vocal performance and the band's new sound. It debuted at number three on the Japanese Albums Chart and has since been certified platinum by the RIAJ.

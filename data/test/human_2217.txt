Motograter was an American heavy metal band formed in Santa Barbara, California in 1995. They are best known for their homemade, namesake instrument, designed with industrial cable and guitar pieces that creates a unique bass sound, and painting themselves in tribal-style body paint for live concerts. Under the band's original line-up between 1998 and 2001, they released two EPs, Hugh Chardon and Indy. In 2002, Ivan "Ghost" Moody took over from original singer Zak Ward and released their debut studio album Motograter in 2003. The band went on an indefinite hiatus in 2005, disbanded after playing a one-time reunion show in 2006, and then reformed in 2008 with a new line-up featuring singer Michael "Angel" Woodruff. They released the EP Pre-Release in 2009, and toured until it again disbanded in 2011. In 2013, the band reformed once again and performed at Slipknot's Knotfest the next year. In December 2014, Woodruff left Motograter; he was replaced with James Anthony Legion on December 17, 2014, from which they released their sophomore album, Desolation in 2017.

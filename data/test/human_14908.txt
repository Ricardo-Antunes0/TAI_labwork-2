Maurine Whipple (January 20, 1903 â€“ April 12, 1992) was an American novelist and short story writer best known for her novel The Giant Joshua (1941). The book is lauded as one of the most important Mormon novels, vividly depicting pioneer and polygamous life in the 19th century. Whipple grew up in St. George, Utah. She attended Dixie College, then graduated from the University of Utah with honors. She taught high school for several years in both Utah and Idaho. After attending the 1937 Rocky Mountain Writer's conference, she made connections that led to her publish The Giant Joshua with Houghton Mifflin. Afterwards, she made plans to make The Giant Joshua into a trilogy, but the two additional volumes, along with two other novels, remained unfinished at the time of her death. Although she never published any additional longer works, she published essays, short stories, and articles in various journals and periodicals.

A pirate television station is a broadcast service that broadcasts content illegally, typically via satellite. The term originally referred to an unauthorized terrestrial television station that used to transmit programming without the required authorization from the government or the proper licensing body.  Today, the term pirate television station typically refers to a cable or satellite service that broadcasts programming illegally, without the required authorization from the government or the proper licensing body. This type of service often targets those who cannot afford traditional pay television services and offers a wider range of programming than what is available through legal channels.  Pirate television stations have been around since the early days of broadcasting. In the early days of television, commercial broadcasters were required to receive government authorization before they could begin broadcasting. However, this restriction was not always enforced, and as a result, many broadcasters began transmitting programming without proper authorization.  As cable and satellite services became more popular, unauthorized terrestrial television stations began to crop up. These stations used to transmit programming over the air using unlicensed antennas. However, with the advent of digital broadcasting, most pirate television stations now use satellite dishes to transmit their signals.  Today, pirate television stations remain an important part of the landscape in many parts of the world. In many countries, these stations offer a wide range of programming that is not available through legal channels. This type of service often appeals to those who are unable to afford traditional pay television services.

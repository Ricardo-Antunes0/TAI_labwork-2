Julia Catherine Beckwith (March 10, 1796 – November 28, 1867) was credited as being Canada's first novelist. Early life Born in Fredericton, New Brunswick, she spent much of her early life in Nova Scotia and Quebec. Her mother Julie-Louise Le Brun, daughter of Jean Baptiste Le Brun de Duplessis came from a wealthy French family who immigrated to Canada during the 17th and 18th century. Beckwith's father Nehemiah Beckwith (U. E. L.), was from New England and settled in New Brunswick in 1780, where he owned a successful ship building company.  It was through her travels to Quebec and Nova Scotia that she incorporated her experiences through her novels. Two years after Beckwith wrote her novel, her father died in a drowning accident and in 1820 and she was sent to live in Upper Canada (Kingston) with family where she would establish a boarding school for girls and meet and then marry George Henry Hart (between 1822–1824).

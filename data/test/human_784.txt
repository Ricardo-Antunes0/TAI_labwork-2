Kunstnerhjemmet (literally "The Artists' Home") on Gothersgade, opposite the Botanical Garden, in Copenhagen, Denmark, was built in the 1870s to provide affordable accommodation and studio facilities for artists. Founded at the initiative of Ferdinand Meldahl, the association behind its construction later also acquired a building on nearby Bartolinsgade. The apartments in the two buildings are open to young, emerging artists as well as aging ones and their widows. History   The Artists' Home is located within the so-called Fortification Ring, where Copenhagen's Bastioned Fortifications ran until they were decommissioned and dug away in the 1950s. The architect Ferdinand Meldahl was a key figure in its redevelopment as well as in the extension of Gothersgade as part of his SÃ¸torvet scheme. He also took the initiative to found the association which was responsible for the construction and running of the Artists' Home. The association was founded on 23 January 1873. Its first chairman, as proposed by Meldahl, was Ole Berendt Suhr  and after his death in 1875 the post was taken over by Lauritz Peter Holmblad. Meldahl personally served as vice chairman. Other members were the flower painter William Hammer and the architectural painter Heinrich Hansen, both personal friends of Meldahl. A long line of established artists donated works which were sold to raise money for the projects although the largest contributions came from the two first chairmen and other peers.

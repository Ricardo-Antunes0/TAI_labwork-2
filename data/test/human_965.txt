A thermoplastic-sheathed cable (TPS) consists of a toughened outer sheath of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) thermoplastic, covering one or more individual annealed copper conductors, themselves insulated with PVC. This type of wiring is commonly used for residential and light commercial construction in many countries. The flat version of the cable, with two insulated conductors and an uninsulated earth conductor (all within the outer sheath), is referred to as twin and earth. In mainland Europe, a round equivalent is more common. Description Each of the current carrying conductors in the "core" is insulated by an individual thermoplastic sheath, coloured to indicate the purpose of the conductor concerned.  The protective earth conductor may also be covered with green/yellow (or green only) insulation, although, in some countries, this conductor may be left as bare copper. With cables where the current carrying conductors are of a large cross sectional area (CSA), the protective earth conductor may be smaller, with a lower continuous current carrying capacity.  The conductors used may be solid in cross-section or multi-stranded.

Sir Francis Bathurst Suttor (30 April 1839 – 4 April 1915) was an Australian pastoralist, politician, and sheep and horse breeder. Early life Suttor was born in Bathurst, New South Wales, the son of pastoralist William Henry Suttor and his wife, Charlotte Augusta Anne née Francis. Francis Bathurst Suttor was a grandson of George Suttor. F. B. Suttor was educated at The King's School, Parramatta, and from age 19 managed his father's properties near Bathurst. He took up the properties Redbank and Katella near Wellington, New South Wales in 1863, and later Bradwardine at Bathurst. In July 1863 Suttor married Emily Jane (1841–1911), daughter of Thomas Jarman Hawkins (1909-1885) of Walmer, Bathurst. Suttor made a study of sheep-breeding; in 1868 he bought 100 merino ewes from C. C. Cox of Brombee and the use of the sire Brombee Pet for two months; Suttor maintained the high standards of Mudgee sheep. With ewes bought from James Alexander Gibson Suttor founded a stud of Tasmanian merinos at Bradwardine that were successful in shows. From a Cleveland Bay sire, Suttor also bred a superior type of horse for coaches which were extensively used in Australia at the time.

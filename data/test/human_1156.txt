The song was released on 20 October 2017 via Capitol and appears as a bonus track on Payne's debut studio album LP1. It impacted US contemporary hit radio on 24 October 2017. Background Payne first revealed the song during his appearance on the Radio 1 Breakfast Show. Payne said of the song, after his girlfriend Cheryl texted host Nick Grimshaw telling him to ask Payne about it: "Bedroom Floor was the single before ['Strip That Down'] was the single. Naturally, it could only be the next one. That's going to be my next single and I'm not allowed to say that yet. [Me and Cheryl] both like that song and it's been her favourite from the start." He revealed the song's release date in a tweet on 23 September 2017. Talking about how he will perform the song during the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball Tour, Payne said to Billboard: "I want the visual to be really good for that. It's just a great song, I can never listen to it and get bored. And all my family loves it as well, so I've got to give it some love." He posted a teaser of the song and a preview of its accompanying music video on 17 and 18 October 2017 respectively. A day before the song's release, he debuted the lyrics through Instagram Stories.

The Liaoshen campaign  Liáoshěn huìzhàn, an abbreviation of Liaoning–Shenyang campaign after the province of Liaoning and its Yuan directly administered capital city Shenyang, was the first of the three major military campaigns (along with Huaihai campaign and Pingjin campaign) launched by the Communist People's Liberation Army (PLA) against the Kuomintang Nationalist government during the late stage of the Chinese Civil War. This engagement is also known to the Kuomintang as the Liaohsi campaign  Liáoxī huìzhàn, and took place between September and November 1948, lasting a total of 52 days. The campaign ended after the Nationalist forces suffered sweeping defeats across Manchuria, losing major cities of Jinzhou, Changchun and eventually Shenyang in the process, eventually leading to the capture of the whole of Manchuria by the Communist forces.  The victory of the campaign resulted in the Communists achieving strategic numerical advantage over the Nationalists for the first time in its history. Background

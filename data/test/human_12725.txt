The Beacon Building is an office building in Downtown Columbus, Ohio. It is located in the Columbus Civic Center area, diagonal to Columbus City Hall. The mid-century modern building was designed by Benham, Richards and Armstrong and completed in 1957. It was first owned by the Beacon Mutual Indemnity Co., and was sold in 1978 to the City of Columbus, which used it for government offices until 2018. History Construction began around 1955, with an expected opening on May 1, 1957. The building was completed in 1957. It was purchased by the city in 1978 for just over $2 million. At this time, the city extensively renovated it, and it became home to five city agencies: the Departments of Community Services and Public Utilities, the Divisions of Electricity and Traffic Engineering, and the Civil Service Commission. The city tried selling it five years later for $2 million, though there were no buyers. It later became home to only the city's public service department. By mid-2018, the department moved to the new Michael B. Coleman Government Center, and the city was looking to sell the Beacon Building to a developer.

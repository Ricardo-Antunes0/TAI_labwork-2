Angolan nationality law is regulated by the Constitution of Angola, as amended; the Nationality Act, and its revisions; and various international agreements to which the country is a signatory. These laws determine who is, or is eligible to be, a national of Angola. The legal means to acquire nationality, formal legal membership in a nation, differ from the domestic relationship of rights and obligations between a national and the nation, known as citizenship. Angolan nationality is typically obtained under the principle of jus sanguinis, i.e. by birth in Angola or abroad to parents with Angolan nationality. It can be granted to persons with an affiliation to the country, or to a permanent resident who has lived in the country for a given period of time through naturalization. Obtaining Angolan nationality Nationality can be obtained in Angola through birth or naturalization. Angolan law makes a distinction between attribution and acquisition of nationality. Attribution is automatic and from birth; whereas, acquisition is obtained later and effective into the future.

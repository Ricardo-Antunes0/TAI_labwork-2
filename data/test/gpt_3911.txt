Osman I or Osman Ghazi (;  ; died 1281) was the founder of the Ottoman dynasty and the first Ottoman Sultan.  Osman I was born in 1209 to a Ghazi family, who were a branch of the Seljuq Turks. At an early age, he became a soldier, and in 1248 he led a military expedition to Anatolia to take back the province from the Byzantine Empire. The following year, he captured Bursa and made it his capital. In 1254, he defeated Antiochus IV Epiphanes, ruler of the Byzantine Empire, at the Battle of Poimanenon and established the Ottoman Empire. As Sultan, Osman I expanded his power beyond Anatolia into Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia, Yemen and North Africa. He also made numerous diplomatic alliances and treaties with other Muslim states.  Osman I died in 1281 and was succeeded by his son Murad II. After his death, Osman I was canonized as a saint by the Orthodox Church and is commemorated on May 21.

Floyd Lavinius Parks (9 February 1896 â€“ 30 January 1984) was an American educator and civil rights activist. Parks was born in Tuskegee, Alabama, to a family of sharecroppers. He attended Tuskegee Institute, where he became involved in the African-American community. In 1941, Parks was arrested while protesting segregation in the Montgomery Bus Boycott. He served time in prison, and upon his release became a leader of the Civil Rights Movement. He helped organize the 1954 boycott of buses in Montgomery, Alabama, which led to the desegregation of public transportation in the United States. In 1962, Parks was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President John F. Kennedy. He died in 1984.

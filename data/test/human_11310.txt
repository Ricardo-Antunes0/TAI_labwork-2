Irvine Theodore Shillingford (born 18 April 1944) is a former West Indian cricketer who played four Tests and two ODIs in 1977 and 1978. He also played a further 88 first class games, 49 of them for the Combined Islands, whom he represented from its inception in 1961 until the dissolution of the team in 1981. He also played first class cricket for the Windward Islands. His Test career began when he was selected for three Tests of the five-match 1976–77 home Test series against Pakistan, replacing Maurice Foster who had made 19 runs from number six in the first Test. Shillingford had made the most runs in the Shell Shield the previous season, with 257, and though he was aged nearly 33 he was given the chance. He made 39 from number five in the first West Indies' innings – in an 81-run partnership with opener Roy Fredericks, helping the West Indies to a lead of 136 runs on first innings. Shillingford only made two runs in the second innings, but the West Indies still won with six wickets to spare.

Mute R. Kelly (styled as #MuteRKelly) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer and actor. He first gained fame in the late 1990s and early 2000s as one of the most successful R&B singers of the era.  Since then, Kelly has been accused of sexual misconduct by numerous women, which he has consistently denied. In 2011, Kelly was charged with 10 counts of aggravated indecent assault against four women, but the charges were dropped in 2012. In 2017, Kelly was indicted on 18 additional counts of sexual abuse against four additional women.  Since his initial arrest and indictment, Kelly has been banned from touring internationally and has been largely absent from public life.

A Greater city movement refers to various urban developments and movements, in which a city or metropolitan area expands its territory in all directions by annexation or incorporation of surrounding municipalities or rural areas.  The movement can be traced back to the late 19th century, when many American cities began to grow rapidly. The reasons for this expansion were manifold: an influx of immigrants, industrialization and the rise of a middle class. Cities were expanding to meet the needs of their growing populations.  Today, Greater city movements are still a common phenomenon around the world. Urban areas continue to grow and shift boundaries, as new housing, businesses and services are developed. Some Greater city movements are peaceful and uncontroversial; others are highly contested and politicized.

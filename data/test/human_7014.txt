The Wilder Homestead is located on Ashfield Road (Massachusetts Route 112),  south of the Upper Road/Ashfield Road junction, in Buckland, Massachusetts.  The property includes three buildings, two of which contribute to its significance.  The house was built c. 1775, and is a fairly typical  Georgian colonial two story house, in which the rear roof extends down to the first floor in saltbox fashion.  A 19th century  ell extends from the east side of the house.  The house was built for Gardner Wilder, who had recently moved to the area, and had purchased  to farm. The second contributing structure is a barn, whose construction was also begun by Gardner Wilder c. 1775.  It was significantly enlarged with a full-height full-width extension in 1840, and a second extension, a -story equipment shed, was added in the 20th century.  The oldest portion shows typical English colonial post and beam construction techniques, and its beams were axe-hewn, unlike those of the first addition, which show saw marks.  The equipment shed was built using modern balloon framing methods.

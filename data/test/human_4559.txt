Roscoea  × beesiana is considered to be a hybrid between R. auriculata and R. cautleyoides which occurred in cultivation. The flowers are variable: most forms have a pale cream base colour with varying amounts of purple streaking, particularly on the lip or labellum. It was given the Award of Garden Merit by the Royal Horticultural Society in 2011. It is classified as being hardy throughout the British Isles. Description Like all members of the genus Roscoea, it dies back each year to a short vertical rhizome, to which are attached the tuberous roots. When growth begins again, "pseudostems" are produced: structures which resemble stems but are actually formed from the tightly wrapped bases (sheaths) of its leaves. R. × beesiana is usually 48–60 cm tall, with seven to nine leaves, of which at most the lowest one consists only of a sheath. Each leaf has a small ligule, extending to about 1–2 mm. The blade of the leaf (the part free from the pseudostem) is usually 8–29 cm long (occasionally as little as 4 cm long) by 2.1–4.5 cm wide. There are small "ears" at the junction of the blade and sheath (i.e. the leaf is somewhat auriculate). The leaf sheath has reddish markings.

On the Menu was an American reality competition series on TNT. It was the first cooking show that gave viewers the chance to taste the winning dish. In each episode, four home cooks battled for the chance to have their dish served in a national restaurant chain. The show featured Ty Pennington as host and Emeril Lagasse as menu master. It was produced by Mark Burnett. Format Each episode begins with the cooks demonstrating they understand the featured restaurant during a preliminary challenge. In the second round, the three remaining contestants create a new dish for the restaurant. The dishes are served to diners whose votes determine which two cooks will move onto the final round. In the final round, the cooks have the opportunity to perfect their dishes based on comments they received from the diners before serving them to Ty, Emeril and representatives of the restaurant. Those representatives determine the winner, whose dish was put on the restaurantâ€™s menu the next day.

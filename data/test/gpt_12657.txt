The "Internal Supervision Regulation" (ISR)  was a set of rules and regulations governing the internal supervision of banks in the European Union. It was introduced on 1 January 2009 as part of the Basel III accord. The ISR replaced the former Supervision Directive (2001/24/EC) and its implementing regulation, the Supervision Rulebook (SRB).  The ISR sets out detailed rules on how banks must operate their internal supervisory processes, including requirements for risk assessment, risk management, and reporting. In addition, the ISR requires banks to appoint a chief internal supervisor (CIS) who is responsible for ensuring that the bank's internal supervisory processes are carried out in a sound and effective manner.  The ISR was repealed on 20 November 2018 by Decision No 765/2018/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council.

Vincent Malo or Vincent Malo I (Cambrai c. 1602 or 1606 – Rome, 14 April 1644) was a Flemish painter who after training and working in Antwerp was mainly active in Italy, where he was known, amongst others, as Vincenzo Malo, Vincenzo Malò and Vincenzio Malo.  He is known Vincent Malo was a painter of genre scenes and of religious and mythological subjects and occasional portraits. Life Due to a lack of reliable sources, the details of Vincent Malo's life are not well established. In 1662 the Flemish biographer Cornelis de Bie called him the "Great master Vincent Malò" and praised him for his skill in painting large- and small-scale works, in particular of nudes. De Bie did not specify any dates for Malo.  The earliest biographer naming a Vincenzio Malo is Raffaello Soprani in his 1768 publication about artists in Genoa Le vite de' pittori, scultori, ed architetti genovesi. This book is still our primary source of information on Malo. The date of birth of Vincent Malo is not known. In a document of 12 March 1637 the painter declares to be 31 years old, which would indicate he was born in 1606.  The registers of the parish of San Lorenzo in Lucina in Rome record that the painter died there on 14 April 1644 at about 42 years old which suggests a birth date around 1602.

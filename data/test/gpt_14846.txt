Lake Passaic was a prehistoric proglacial lake that covered about 800 square miles in the Passaic River Valley in northern New Jersey. The lake was formed about 18,000 years ago during the Wisconsin glaciation, and it was drained about 10,000 years ago during the late Wisconsin glaciation.   Lake Passaic was one of the largest lakes in the North American continent during the Pleistocene. It reached a maximum size of about 110 square miles, and its surface area is estimated to have been greater than that of Lake Ontario. The lake was formed along the eastern edge of the Laurentide ice sheet, and it drained into the Passaic River Valley through a series of interconnected channels. The lake was located at an altitude of about 1,000 feet above sea level, and its shores were lined with a variety of prehistoric ecosystems.  The lake discharged water through a series of distributaries that emptied into the Passaic River Valley. The largest distributary was known as Little Passaic Creek, and it drained an area that was larger than Lake Ontario. Lake Passaic also drained a number of smaller distributaries, including Goose Creek and Mill Creek. The lake's water reached the Passaic River Valley through a series of tributaries that flowed into the river from the east and northeast.  Lake Passaic was a significant source of water for residents in the Passaic River Valley during the late Wisconsin glaciation. The lake's waters provided drinking water for residents in Newark and Jersey City, as well as for industries in Pat

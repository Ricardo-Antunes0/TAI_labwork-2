Diffusion-controlled (or diffusion-limited) reactions are reactions in which the rate of reaction depends on the concentration of reactants in the vicinity. In diffusion-controlled reactions, the rate of reaction is limited by the rate of diffusion of reactants into and out of the reaction mixture.   The diffusion-controlled reaction was first described by French chemist Auguste Laurent de Marignac in 1876. He observed that the rate of a chemical reaction was inversely proportional to the concentration of the reactants near the surface of a vessel. This phenomenon is now known as de Marignac's law.

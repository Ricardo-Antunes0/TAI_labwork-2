Cholecystokinin (CCK or CCK-PZ; from Greek chole, gallbladder and kyklos, circle) is a peptide hormone secreted by the gallbladder. It is a potent stimulator of gallbladder contractions.  Cholecystokinin is produced in response to food in the small intestine and is released into the bloodstream where it travels to the liver. There, it binds to CCK-A receptors, which are located on the cell membrane of the hepatocytes. This interaction causes the release of cholecystokinin-like molecules, such as CCK-P, from the cells. These molecules stimulate the cells to release bile and contractions in the gallbladder.

Pope Innocent VII (; ; 1339 â€“ 1416), born Giovanni di Lorenzo de'Medici, was the 115th and final pope of the Catholic Church. He served from 1404 to his death in 1416.  Born into a prominent Florentine family, Giovanni became the Archbishop of Florence in 1294. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1303 and then to the papacy in 1334, during the Western Schism. As pope, Giovanni restored papal authority throughout Italy and ended the practice of selling indulgences. His initiatives led to the founding of many churches and monasteries. He died in 1416 and was succeeded by his son, Pope Martin V.

Harm Reduction International, formerly known as International Harm Reduction Association (IHA), is a global non-profit organization that promotes harm reduction as an effective way to reduce the risks associated with drug use and other behavior.  Harm reduction is a public health approach that aims to reduce the negative consequences of substance use by providing safer alternatives to drug use. Harm reduction methods may include needle exchanges, condom availability, and alcohol moderation.  Harm reduction has been shown to be an effective way to reduce the risks associated with drug use. According to the World Health Organization, harm reduction interventions have been proven to be more effective in preventing HIV and other infections than abstinence-only policies.  In 1992, International Harm Reduction Association was founded in London with the aim of preventing HIV and other infections among drug users. The association changed its name to Harm Reduction International in 2003.

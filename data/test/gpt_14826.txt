Hartland Abbey is a former abbey and now a country house in Hartland, Somerset, England. It is a Grade I listed building.  The abbey was founded in 1146 by Richard de Clare, 3rd Earl of Hertford. It was originally a small Benedictine priory, but grew rapidly in size and importance under the patronage of the kings of England. The abbey was badly damaged by fire in 1536 and was largely rebuilt in the late 16th century by Sir John Popham. In the late 17th century, it passed to the Earls of Arundel and was used as a residence by the family. In 1838, it was sold to the Duke of Devonshire and subsequently became a country house. The duke's son, the 8th Duke of Devonshire, gave the house to the National Trust in 1945.

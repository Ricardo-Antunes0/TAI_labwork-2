Early life and education Sweet was born into a Methodist family in Brunswick, Victoria; her English father George Sweet was an amateur geologist and encouraged both his daughters to enter tertiary education. Sweet attended the Parkville Ladies' College, then went on to the University of Melbourne where she completed her BSc in 1896 and her MSc in 1898.

She was awarded her DSc in 1904 for her study of Notoryctes –  the marsupial mole; she was the first woman to take out a Doctor of Science at the University. Her work on parasites in Australian native animals and stock led to the award of the David Syme Research Prize in 1911, she was the first female recipient of the prize and she received a reputation as Australia's foremost parasitologist.

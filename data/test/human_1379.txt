Morton is a Finnish restaurant chain consisting of hamburger restaurants built into cargo containers active in summertime and the all-year-round restaurant Morton in Helsinki. History The 22-year-olds Jarna Kaplas, Petri Virta and Iiro Lyytinen founded restaurant Morton with 300 places and a music venue in Rautalampi in summer 2010. The founders were young entrepreneurship students from the Tiimiakatemia academy in Jyväskylä. They had only two and a half months of experience from the restaurant industry put together. Virta and Lyytinen were from Rautalampi with 3000 inhabitants and Kaplas was from neighbouring Suonenjoki. The restaurant was founded in an old hardware store with a business area of 300 square metres. The premises were renovated in a volunteer effort attended by 70 local people. The restaurant was named after a 18th century American politician. The roots of John Morton's great-grandfather are said to have come from Rautalampi. This business idea caused much confusion, but the restaurant became popular. During the next five years, the venue was attended by about 150 artists, including JVG, PMMP, Jukka Poika, Sound Explosion Band, Jätkäjätkät, Samuli Putro and Petri Nygård. When the founders received offers to found restaurants in other cities too, they had an idea to build restaurants in old cargo containers.

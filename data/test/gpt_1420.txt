Widerøe Flight 839, also known as the Widerøe Flight 981 disaster, was a domestic passenger flight from Oslo to Bergen that crashed into the sea shortly after takeoff from runway 36 at Moss Airport, Moss on 1 March 1991. All 93 passengers and crew were killed in the crash.   The accident was caused by a loss of engine power shortly after takeoff, which caused the aircraft to roll and descend uncontrolled into the sea. The aircraft had been in service with Widerøe since 1985 and had amassed over 5,000 hours of flying time.

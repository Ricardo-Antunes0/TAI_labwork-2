The Bola de Ouro (Golden Ball) is an annual professional wrestling event produced by the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) promotion. It is the company's premier event of the year, and is traditionally held in late December or early January.  The Bola de Ouro was first contested in 1988, as a World Wrestling Federation (WWF)-produced show that was held in Brazil. The main event of the show was a match between Hulk Hogan and The Iron Sheik for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. The event was a success and led to the creation of the annual event.   The Bola de Ouro has since been held in various other countries, including Mexico, Japan, Spain, Germany, Italy, and Canada. In 2009, WWE rebranded the event as the Royal Rumble match and moved it to January of each year.   The Bola de Ouro is considered one of WWE's most important shows of the year, as it is typically the biggest wrestling event of the year. The event typically features multiple world title matches and other major matches.

Praying towns were a series of settlements in England and Wales founded in the 18th century as a result of the Protestant Reformation. They were originally designed to be places where Protestants could come to pray without having to leave their homes, and to live in close proximity to each other so that they could support each other spiritually.  Today, praying towns are often seen as an important part of the history of Protestantism in Britain, and are often visited by tourists. Some of the surviving praying towns, such as Ickenham and Witney, continue to operate as tourist attractions.

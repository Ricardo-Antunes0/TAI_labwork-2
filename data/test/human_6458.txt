Youth and Educators Succeeding, formerly known as Generation YES, is a U.S. non-profit organization that works with schools around the world to empower underserved students and ensure that technology investments in education are both cost effective and meaningful. Adam Fletcher (speaker) is the founder and CEO. YES programs focus on student centered, project-based learning "experiences that impact student's lives and increase student involvement in school and community through the use of technology. In addition, all YES programs improve the use of technology in the school as a whole." History Youth and Educators Succeeding was founded by Dr. Dennis Harper in 1995 when he was a technology director for the Olympia, Washington school district. He wrote a United States Department of Education Technology Innovation Challenge Grant proposal to develop an initiative to involve children in the acceptance of technology in curriculum. The grant was approved in 1996 for five years, concluding in 2001. In 2020, Adam Fletcher became the Executive Director of Youth and Educators Succeeding.

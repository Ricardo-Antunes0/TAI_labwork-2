Arthur Rotherham (27 May 1869 â€“ 3 October 1942) was an English serial killer who sexually abused and exploited children in Rotherham, Yorkshire, England, between the late 1960s and early 2000s.  Rotherham became internationally known in 2002 when the BBC's investigative documentary series "Panorama" broadcast footage of children being interviewed about their experiences of sexual abuse by Rotherham men. The series prompted a national public inquiry, the Rotherham child sex abuse scandal. It led to the conviction of 12 men and the resignation of the town's then-mayor, Roger Stone.  Rotherham was born in Rotherham on 27 May 1869, the son of George and Sarah Rotherham. He married Ellen Brookes in 1902, with whom he had two children. He died in 1942 at the age of 70.

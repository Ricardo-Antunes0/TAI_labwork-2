A thermal blanket is a device used in cold weather to increase the body's warmth. The blanket is made of a thermal material, typically polyester or wool, and is often fitted with a hood for extra insulation.  The thermal blanket is usually worn over clothing and is placed around the torso, legs and arms. It works by trapping body heat and distributing it evenly throughout the body. This can help to increase the body's temperature by up to 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit).

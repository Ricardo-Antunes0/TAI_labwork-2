Manousis was born in 1793 in the city of Patras in the Peloponnese region of Greece. He completed his education at the University of Athens, where he studied law. However, he soon abandoned this career in favour of a literary life. He began publishing poetry in 1820, and his first novel, The Physician's Wife, was published in 1828. He died in 1858.

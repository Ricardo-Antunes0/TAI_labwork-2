Thomas Chalmers Vint (August 15, 1894 â€“ January 3, 1978) was an American mathematician who made significant contributions to the theory of elliptic functions.  Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, Vint attended the University of Michigan, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1916 and his doctorate in 1919. He then taught at the University of Minnesota from 1919 to 1922, before moving to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he served as a professor of mathematics from 1922 to 1954.  Vint made important contributions to the theory of elliptic functions, which is a field of mathematics dealing with problems involving curves that are modeled by certain mathematical functions. His work has had a lasting impact on the field, and he is often regarded as one of the foremost experts on elliptic curves.  Vint also has interests in number theory and cryptography, and he was one of the founders of the Journal of Number Theory. He died in 1978 at the age of 82.

Thepublicrecord.com (TPR) is the brainchild of producer Scott Humphrey that went live on October 5, 2009, with Tommy Lee's interactive project album titled A Public Disservice Announcement. Initially based out of The Atrium; Tommy Lee's home studio in Calabasas, California, it is now hosted from Hollywood, CA. It is an interactive website where fans, musicians or anyone who has an audio or visual concept and the means to record to digital format can come to participate with like minded artists/musicians. Users then can interact amongst themselves or with major artists who offer up their creative works in the form of stems; the industries term for components of a mix/song such as a drum part, a guitar part, a bass part, etc. Members download the raw tracks (stems), plug it into their DAW or capable mobile app and record their parts. They then submit parts by uploading them onto the public record (TPR) servers in mp3 format @ 128kps utilizing one featured mixed track and the component solo formats.

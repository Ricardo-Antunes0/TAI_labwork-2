Recovering from Religion (RfR) is an international, secular, non-profit organization, founded in 2003. RfR's mission is to promote a secular approach to psychological health and well-being by providing resources and support to individuals who have abandoned or cut ties with their religious beliefs.  Religion has been shown to have negative effects on mental health and well-being, with studies indicating that people who are religious are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Many people who have left their religious beliefs find that they need support in order to recover from their experience and rebuild their lives. RfR is committed to providing that support, through its website, social media platforms, and community events.  RfR offers a variety of resources to individuals who have abandoned or cut ties with their religious beliefs. These resources include information on psychological health and well-being, self-help techniques, community events, and support groups. RfR also works to raise awareness of the negative effects of religion on mental health and well-being, and to promote a secular approach to psychological health and well-being.

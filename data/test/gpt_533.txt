Preiddeu Annwfn or Preiddeu Annwn  is a Welsh language folk song. It is traditionally thought to be of ancient origin, and is mentioned in the Mabinogion.  The song tells the story of two lovers, Preiddeu and Annwfn, who are parted by a cruel fate. Preiddeu is forced to leave his beloved behind, and every night he prays for her safety. One day, Annwfn finds herself in a similar situation and is also forced to leave her loved behind. They meet again years later, and are finally able to be together once more.

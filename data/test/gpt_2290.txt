Sean Ricardo Salmon (born September 11, 1608, died September 13, 1685) was an early American colonist and the second governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.  Salmon was born in the town of Truro in Cornwall, England, and came to America in 1635 as a servant to Sir Ferdinando Gorges, one of the founding proprietors of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. After serving his three-year apprenticeship as a tailor, Salmon became one of the colony's leading merchants. He served as deputy to the first governor, John Winthrop, and later became governor himself from 1654 to 1658. In 1659 he was elected as a representative to the General Court of Massachusetts Bay, where he served until his death. Salmon was also known for his piety and philanthropy. He helped found several churches in Massachusetts and was instrumental in bringing Christianity to the Native Americans.

The Relative Atrial Index (RAI) is a measure of heart rate variability that reflects the variability of atrial activity. The RAI is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the atrial rate by the mean atrial rate.  The RAI has been shown to be a predictor of cardiovascular disease risk, and may be useful in the assessment of patients with heart disease. Additionally, the RAI may be useful in the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation.

was the 8th (and final) Abe daimyō of Shirakawa Domain, and the 1st Abe daimyō of Tanagura Domain. Biography Abe Masakiyo was the eldest son of Abe Masato, who at the time was a 3000 koku hatamoto. After the sudden death of Abe Masahisa of Shirakawa Domain in 1864, Abe Masato was selected to posthumously inherit the 100,000 koku domain and Masakiyo inherited the original 3000 koku holding as well as the courtesy title of Mimasaka-no-kami, and his Court rank of Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade. However, in 1866, when his father was forced into retirement  for his actions in the opening of the port of Hyōgo to foreign trade, Masakiyo was named daimyō of Shirakawa. The very same day, he was transferred to Tanagura and Shirakawa Domain became tenryō territory under direct control of the Shogunate. Although he protested the move, and later petitioned to return to Shirakawa, he was allowed to return for less than a month before Komine Castle was again taken from him, and placed under the control of Nihonmatsu Domain.

The Point Defiance Bypass (officially the Lakeview Subdivision) is a  rail line between the cities of DuPont and Tacoma in Pierce County, Washington. It was originally built by the Northern Pacific Railway – the Tacoma–Lakewood segment in 1874 as part of the Prairie Line, and the Lakewood–DuPont section in 1891. Passenger service on the lines declined after the 1914 completion of a flatter route along Puget Sound, and ended entirely in 1956. The route was identified as a passenger rail bypass in 1992. Sounder commuter rail service to Lakewood began in 2012. The $181.1 million improvement of the remaining section began construction in 2015 as part of general improvements to the Amtrak Cascades corridor to eliminate the slow and winding route along the Puget Sound shoreline that included single-track tunnels. It was opened for Amtrak service on December 18, 2017, but the first Cascades train derailed at speed on a bridge over Interstate 5 while traveling southbound near DuPont. Amtrak service was rerouted to the old line until passenger service resumed on November 18, 2021.

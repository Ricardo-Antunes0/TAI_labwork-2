"F0" is defined as the number of degrees Kelvin at which the liquid boils.   The "Z-value" is a measure of temperature that is based on the molecular theory of heat. It is defined as the absolute temperature difference between two points, divided by the temperature of the reference point.   The "Z-value" is most commonly used in engineering to determine the maximum safe operating temperature for a material or system.

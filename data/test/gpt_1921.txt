Lloyd James  (born 26 October 1947) is a Jamaican reggae artist and one of the pioneers of the ska and rocksteady styles. He is one of the most influential artists in Jamaica, and his recordings have been influential in the development of reggae music in both Europe and the United States.  James was born in Manchester, England, to a family of nine children. His family moved to Jamaica when he was very young, and he began working as a soundsystem operator at the age of 14. He began performing as a vocalist in 1962, and recorded his first single, "Money in My Pocket", in 1968. He released his first album, "King Jammy's First Album", the following year. In the early 1970s, James began to experiment with rocksteady music, which led to his most popular style, dub rocksteady. In 1976, he released the album "Roots Radics Reggae", which is considered his classic work. He has since released dozens of albums and singles, including several collaborations with Peter Tosh.  James has also been involved in politics. He was elected to the Jamaican Parliament in 1987, and served until 2001. He has also been a vocal advocate for social reform in Jamaica, and has worked to promote equal rights for the Jamaican diaspora. He is currently a senator for the People's National Party (PNP).

Pioneers' Day or Pioneer Day was a statutory holiday in the United States of America that commemorated the arrival of the first group of American settlers in the Oregon Country, now northwestern Oregon. The holiday was first observed on October 24, 1872, and was officially designated a national holiday by Congress in 1887. Celebrations typically include public ceremonies, parades, and festivals.  The term "pioneers" has been used to describe people who explore new territory, undertake new tasks, or establish new ideas. The term is often used to refer to individuals who immigrated to new countries, continents, or even other parts of the world. The pioneers were often adventurers who left their homes and families to seek a better life. They were explorers, traders, and settlers. They risked everything to start over in a new land.  The first American settlers in the Oregon Country were fur traders and missionaries who arrived in 1811. For the next several years, they explored and settled the area. In 1843, the United States government sent a military expedition to claim the Oregon Country for America. The settlers who had already arrived decided to join the military expedition.  The soldiers arrived in Oregon on October 24, 1843. They found a group of people living in Fort Vancouver who had been there since 1825. The soldiers named the settlement Portland after Portland, Maine, where they had come from. The first American settlers in the Oregon Country were known as the "Pioneers."

Charles Gunter Gallagher (September 21, 1925 – March 24, 2004) was an American mathematician who made significant contributions to the theory of Banach spaces and operator theory.  Charles Gallagher was born on September 21, 1925, in Cleveland, Ohio. He received his undergraduate degree in mathematics from Princeton University in 1947 and his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1951. After a year of post-doctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley, he became a professor at the University of Michigan in 1957. He remained at Michigan until his retirement in 1993.  Charles Gallagher's work in operator theory and Banach spaces focused on the solution of problems in functional analysis, probability theory, and mathematical physics. His most famous result is the Gallagher–Petersson theorem, which states that every holomorphic function on a compact Hausdorff space is a solution to a Piola–Kirchhoff problem. He also developed techniques for characterizing operators on Banach spaces and for solving problems arising in mathematical physics.  Charles Gallagher died on March 24, 2004, after a long illness. He was survived by his wife, Margaret; two sons; and six grandchildren.

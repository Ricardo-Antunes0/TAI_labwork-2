The Minisode Network (later known as Crackle) was a streaming video website owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment that offered short form episodic television programming. The site was launched on August 15, 2006, as a joint venture between Sony Pictures Television and Microsoft Corporation's Xbox 360 video game console.  The Minisode Network operated as a direct-to-consumer service, allowing users to watch individual episodes of shows without having to subscribe to a cable or satellite television service. The site was designed to allow viewers to "binge watch" entire seasons of shows in just a few minutes. Shows were available for download or streaming on Crackle's website and through the Xbox 360's built-in video player.  In February 2013, Sony Pictures Entertainment announced that it would cease operating the Minisode Network after failing to find a new investor or partner for the site. While the network had modest viewership, it was notable for being one of the first major streaming services to offer episodic television programming exclusively through the web.

The A1 in London is the southernmost of the London motorways, running from the M25 motorway in Surrey to the A2 motorway in Essex. The A1 is a dual carriageway for its entire length, and is designated as part of the Euro Route E15.  The A1 runs through London's South East, linking major centres including London, Brighton, Bournemouth, Poole and Portsmouth. It crosses the River Thames at Dartford and passes through the capital's suburbs before reaching Chelmsford. The A1 then skirts the edge of the city of Luton before reaching its eastern terminus at the A2.  The A1 was originally planned as an express route between London and Birmingham, but was extended eastward when it was realised that it would also provide a route between London and the south coast. The opening of the M25 in 1994 made it possible to continue the original plan and the A1 now forms part of a larger beltway around London.

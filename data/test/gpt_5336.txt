The Turner Turnpike is a toll road in the U.S. state of New Jersey that runs from the Delaware state line in Chester County to the New York state line in Sussex County. The road is maintained by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.  The Turner Turnpike was built in 1925-26 by the Delaware, Licking, and Western Railroad as a feeder route to its main line between Newark and Columbus, Ohio. It was designed by the famed engineer George Turner, who also designed the Pulaski Skyway and parts of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The Turner Turnpike was initially toll-free but charges were instituted in 1956. In 1984, a new electronic tolling system was installed, which has been upgraded several times since then.  The Turner Turnpike is designated as part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are important for the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.

ESTE ARTE is an international art fair held annually every January in Punta del Este, Uruguay. It presents international art galleries, which showcase both established and newly emerging artists. In addition to the artworks shown by participating galleries, the fair offers parallel programming including seminars by experts open to the public, debates hosted by different artists, shows featuring sound art and scheduled guided visits. ESTE ARTE brings an artistic offering that ranges from historical avant-gardes to emerging and contemporary art. While ESTE ARTE provides the platform for galleries to show and sell their work to collectors, museum directors, and curators, it also attracts a large international audience of art spectators and students. It was established in 2015 by Uruguayan curator Laura Bardier and despite its recent history it has become an important cultural event in the country, acting as a catalyser for other cultural activities. Galleries who apply to ESTE ARTE present a proposal of the display planned for the occasion. Each application is considered for participation by a Selection Committee of national curators, following standards established by ESTE ARTE based on what is presented for the booth and the general programme of the gallery. The Committee aims to focus on searching for galleries and projects that start new tendencies in the art system. It is Uruguay's first and only art fair of its kind.

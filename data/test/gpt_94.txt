An ion laser is a gas laser that uses ions as its light sources. Ions are atoms or molecules that have had their electrons stripped away, leaving them with a positive charge.  Ions are very easily manipulated by laser radiation, which means that ion lasers can produce very high-quality, intense light beams. They are also relatively easy to construct, making them a popular choice for research and industrial applications.

Petrus (or Peter) van Mastricht (or Maastricht) (1630 – February 9, 1706) was a Reformed theologian. He was born in Cologne to a refugee from Maastricht during the Dutch revolt. His father's family name was originally "Schoning," but he changed it to "van Mastricht" on moving to Cologne. Petrus occasionally used the Latinized pseudonym Scheuneneus. Johannes Hoornbeeck was Masticht's pastor from 1639 to 1643 and his teacher at the University of Utrecht starting in 1647, along with Gisbertus Voetius and others. From 1650 to 1652 he took a tour of study at Leiden University and possibly Oxford and the University of Heidelberg. From there he took pastorates at Xanten, Glückstadt, Frankfurt an der Oder, and Duisburg. While Mastricht is considered to be a follower of the school of Voetius, his Classis (ecclesiastical) in Xanten was predominantly Cocceian, a school to which Voetians were opposed. For this reason, and because of some irenic statements Mastricht made, he is considered to have been somewhat ecumenical in contrast to the vitriolic polemics common between Voetians and Coccieans of his day. He completed his Master of Arts and Doctor of Theology at the University of Duisburg in 1669 while serving as a pastor. Mastricht served as professor of Hebrew and theology at that university from 1670 to 1677. He then succeeded Voetius as professor of Hebrew and theology at the University of Utrecht in 1677. He also served as an elder and supply preacher for the classis of Amsterdam. He served there until he became too infirm and began teaching at home in 1700. He died February 9, 1706.

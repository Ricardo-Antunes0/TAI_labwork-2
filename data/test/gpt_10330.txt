The enhanced versatile disc (EVD) is an optical disc format which was jointly developed by the DVD Forum, the Blu-ray Disc Association and the CD Audio Disc Association. The format is based on the DVD-9 format and offers increased capacity over that format, up to 4.7 GB per disc.  The first commercially available EVD was the BDXL format, which was announced by the Blu-ray Disc Association on February 8, 2006. The BDXL format features a dual-layer structure, with a single layer of data and a second layer of data that is formatted to be read as audio. The first BDXL discs were released in late 2006.  On July 12, 2010, the Blu-ray Disc Association announced that it had reached an agreement with Toshiba to develop an 8.5 GB EVD format. The first 8.5 GB EVD discs were released in early 2011.

was the fifty-sixth of the sixty-nine stations of the Nakasendō, a major Imperial highway running from Kyoto to Edo (modern Tokyo).  Akasaka-juku is located in Minato Ward of Tokyo, and is bounded by the Arakawa River on the north, the Seibu Shinjuku Line on the east, and the Tōbu Expressway on the south. The station opened on November 1, 1876.   The station originally served as a stopping point for passengers travelling between Kyoto and Edo. It also became a popular shopping destination thanks to its proximity to Akasaka-bashi Station on the Ikebukuro Line and numerous department stores such as Isetan, Sogo, Mitsukoshi, and Takashimaya. In addition, it was also home to several hotels such as the Akasaka Prince Hotel and the Akasaka Oriental Hotel.  Today, Akasaka-juku is an important business district and home to a number of large companies such as Sony, Nissan, Honda, Hitachi, and Panasonic. It also serves as a major transportation hub for commuters travelling to central Tokyo.

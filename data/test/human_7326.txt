John Ferneley College is a mixed college located in Melton Mowbray in the English county of Leicestershire. The college is part of the Mowbray Education Trust, a multi-academy trust that includes JFC and several primary schools in the local area. The college is named after John Ferneley, a painter who lived in Melton Mowbray, and who is regarded as one of the great British equine artists. The college has specialist status in Business and Enterprise. Previously a community school administered by Leicestershire County Council, John Ferneley College converted to academy status in November 2011. However the college continues to coordinate with Leicestershire County Council for admissions. Facilities A new college building was opened at the old Ferneley site in April 2010, and a spillover building, known as the enrichment centre,  was opened in March 2012. The college features many double sized classrooms, which can accommodate up to sixty students at once and are used for team-teaching. As part of the corporate image of the college, no displays of student work are permitted in classrooms, which are instead painted white with a bold single colour feature wall.  In 2019, a new area was built primarily for language lessons which was officially made part of the “culture zone”.

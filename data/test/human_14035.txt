Carlos Paton Blacker MC GM FRCP (8 December 1895 â€“ 21 April 1975), also known as C. P. Blacker, was an eminent war hero, psychiatrist and eugenicist who worked with R.A. Fisher and Lionel Penrose. Blacker was educated at Eton and Oxford where he attained distinction in biology under the tutelage of Julian Huxley. He served with the Coldstream Guards during World War I, was twice mentioned in dispatches, and was awarded the Military Cross for action in which he was involved on 15 September 1916. Twelve months previously he had lost his only sibling, a brother Robin, at Loos. Robin had also been an officer in the Coldstream Guards. C. P. felt that war was dysgenic because it killed people who tended to be above the physical average and deterred thoughtful people from parenthood. He was deeply shaken by his war experience and, in coming to terms with it, with the loss of his brother and many of his contemporaries, acknowledged a debt to Freud's writings, which stimulated in him an interest in psychiatry. Qualifying in medicine in 1925, Blacker became a registrar in Guy's Hospital's psychiatric department for three years and continued his study at the Maudsley Hospital. He later became a part-time member of its teaching staff and was later the first chairman of the newly established Simon Population Trust.

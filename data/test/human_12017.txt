Kan'Nal is a rock music band first formed in Guatemala in 2000 and has toured Canada, the United States, Mexico and Central America. The band began as a duo composed of lead singer and songwriter Tzol (a.k.a. Kurt Baumann) and guitarist Tierro (a.k.a. Terence Malloy), quickly adding bassist Rodolfo Escobar III, and performance artist backing vocalist Teresita Hinojosa that winter in San Marcos La Laguna, Guatemala. The band played many shows in Central America as well as Mexico for most of 2001. That summer they traveled to the US to play the Dreamtime Festival in Paonia, Colorado, where they added drummer Gilly Gonzalez & didgeridoo player Aaron Jerad to fill out the group's rhythm section. In 2003, the group added dancer Akayate to complete the band's live performance show. Kan'Nal’s original dancers were Sage and Zarah of Sangre Del Sol. Tiffany Smyth also made guest appearances, as well as created leather masks & various pieces for the stage productions. Original concepts for the stage performance were created by Akayate and Teresita. In 2005 Aaron Jerad left the group and was replaced by Brock Roser, playing didgeridoo, percussion, and vocal harmonies. The band describes itself as "an authentic Rock & Roll band" playing "Tribal Psychedelic Rock." Many of the band's songs—especially live versions—are long, sprawling, epic affairs featuring layers of flamenco-style guitar and thrumming bass guitar over the steady drone of didgeridoo and percussion, though shorter, more commercially accessible (i.e. "radio friendly") tracks like "All Things Change" and "Time" are notable in their difference as an attempt to appeal to more mainstream music tastes.

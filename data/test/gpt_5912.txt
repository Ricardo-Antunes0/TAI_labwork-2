Kpengla was a King of the Kingdom of Mapungubwe in southern Africa during the late 10th century. He was the son of Mpangla and a brother of Makhole.  Kpengla succeeded his father in 992 and ruled until his death in 1005. He is best known for his role in the Battle of Ndlambe, where he led an army against the Zulus. The battle ended in a victory for the Mapungubwe kingdom, and Kpengla was recognised as a king by the Zulu king Shaka.

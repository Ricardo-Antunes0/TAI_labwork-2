Wang Jingchong (; 847â€“883), courtesy name Meng'an, was a Chinese painter, calligrapher, poet and scholar of the Tang Dynasty. He is considered one of the most important painters in Song Dynasty China.  Born into a wealthy family in what is now Wuhan, Jiangxi, Wang Jingchong began his studies of painting and calligraphy at an early age and became a virtuoso within his field. He soon gained a reputation for his skillful brushstrokes and lively palette, and attracted the attention of many influential figures in the government and court circles. In 882, he was appointed as a court artist to serve Emperor Xizong of Tang. Over the next several years, he produced a series of paintings depicting scenes from Tang history. In 886, he was elevated to the rank of Tong Zhongshuangshi (a position roughly equivalent to minister).  Wang Jingchong died in883 at the age of 49, leaving behind an extensive body of work that has been praised by later generations of artists as among the finest examples of Chinese painting. He is particularly noted for his depictions of landscapes and historical scenes, as well as for his skillful use of color.

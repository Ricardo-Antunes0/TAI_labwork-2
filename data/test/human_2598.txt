The Dionysus mosaic found in Samatya, Istanbul, was uncovered in 1995 while the lot it was discovered in was under construction. It could have been created between the 4th and 5th century, with evidence supporting it to be from the later part of the 5th century. The mosaic is severely damaged due to construction machinery, and much of the piece is missing because of the urban landscape. What remains is a traditional Byzantine mosaic depicting the chariot of Dionysus, with a grand thiasos, or parade of followers circled around the god of wine. Design  The mosaic itself was 2.5 meters by 10 meters at the time of excavation. It consists of a square panel that is defined by two bands; the bands are multi-colored guilloches. Within the square panel are two circles; one within the other. These circles are framed by laurel wreaths that are created by a sawlike pattern band with colored fillets. Between the square panel and the outermost circle is the embodiment of Winter; a female dressed for winter with a green mantle. In the area between the first and second circle is Dionysus's thiasos. The thiasos is seen moving in a clockwise rotation with figures that include Silenos sitting on a mule supported by a satyr, a dancing maenad with an unidentified object in her hand, a male flutist, and a child with no clothes sitting upon a goat. All of these people and beings are from stories in Greek mythology related to Dionysus.

A trade study or trade-off study, also known as a figure of merit analysis or a factor of merit analysis, is the activity of a multidisciplinary team to identify the most balanced technical solutions among a set of proposed viable solutions (FAA 2006). These viable solutions are judged by their satisfaction of a series of measures or cost functions. These measures describe the desirable characteristics of a solution. They may be conflicting or even mutually exclusive. Trade studies are commonly used in the design of aerospace and automotive vehicles and the software selection process (Phillips et al. 2002) to find the configuration that best meets conflicting performance requirements. The measures are dependent on variables that characterize the different potential solutions. If the system can be characterized by a set of equations, one can write the definition of the trade study problem as: Find the set of variables, xi, that give the best overall satisfaction to the measures:

In 2016 at the first event of Q School, Keogan defeated highly rated youngsters Jamie Clarke and Adam Stefanow as well as former professionals Lü Chenwei and Joel Walker before he reached the final round against Marc Davis whom he defeated 4–0, a win which gave Keogan a two-year card to the World Snooker Tour for the 2016–17 season and 2017–18  seasons. He lost in the last 64 of four events during his first season as a professional. He dropped off the tour at the end of the 2017/18 season but entered Q School in an attempt to win back a place.

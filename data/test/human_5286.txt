The Grenada National Museum is a museum in St. George's, Grenada. It is housed in a complex of several buildings, the oldest of which may have served as a French barracks from 1704. Parts of it were used by the adjacent prison until the 1850s, when the land was sold and the Home Hotel was built. It remained a hotel (and briefly, a warehouse in the 1940s) under several owners until closing in the early 1960s. In 1976, the Gairy government donated part of the complex for use as a museum of archaeology and history. Topics on display include Amerindians/Precolonial, the European Invasion, African Slavery, Plantation Economy, the former whaling industry, and colonial-era equipment and artifacts, including several items and a bathtub purportedly used by Josephine Bonaparte.

Two other different hotels under different owners followed, and at one point was used as a warehouse by a merchant working in St. George's..

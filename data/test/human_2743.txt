MS Mega Regina is a cruiseferry owned by Corsica Ferries. She was formerly owned and operated by Viking Line as MS Mariella. She was built by the Wärtsilä Perno shipyard in Turku, Finland and delivered to SF Line in 1985. Her sister ship is the Olympia (now MS SPL Princess Anastasia). Mariella was the world's largest cruiseferry from 1985 until 1989, when the accolade passed on to her Viking Line fleetmate MS Athena. Mariella was sold to Corsica Ferries in 2021 and renamed Mega Regina. The ship started traffic on the Mediterranean Sea in summer 2021. History When the Mariella was delivered in 1985, she was the first ship on Viking Line's Helsinki–Stockholm service which was not owned by Rederi Ab Sally. She has remained on the same route ever since, except for a few brief times when she has been moved temporarily on to other Viking Line routes. This makes her the record holder for the longest continual service on the Helsinki–Stockholm route. At the time of her delivery, the Mariella was the largest ferry in the world in terms of gross tonnage, number of passengers and passenger berths.

An internal combustion engine (ICE or IC engine) is a engine in which the combustion of a fuel in the air/fuel mixture creates mechanical energy that is converted to power. ICEs are used in vehicles, industrial machinery and power plants.  The first ICE was built in 1876 by Siegfried Motorenbau AG. The modern ICE was developed in the early 20th century. ICEs are now the most common engine type in use worldwide. They are also the most popular engine type in the world for electric vehicles.

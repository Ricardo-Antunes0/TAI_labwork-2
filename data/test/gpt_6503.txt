Within psychometrics, Item analysis refers to statistical methods used to evaluate the psychometric properties of items in a survey or test.  Item analysis is used to evaluate the psychometric properties of items in a survey or test. This includes determining the reliability, validity, and item response theory (IRT) models applicable to the items. It can also include verifying the convergent and discriminant validity of the items.  Item analysis is also used to create an item pool from which to construct tests or surveys. This is done by identifying the best items from the pool and selecting them for use in the survey or test. In addition, item analysis can be used to identify which items are most important for measuring a particular construct.

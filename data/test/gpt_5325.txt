The Loening XS2L was an American biplane fighter aircraft manufactured by the Loening Aircraft Corporation during the 1930s. It was a single-seat, low-wing monoplane with a fixed conventional landing gear and a single forward firing gun. The XS2L was one of the first American aircraft to be armed with an automatic weapon, the Browning M1919A4 machine gun.  The XS2L was designed as a fighter aircraft for use by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and saw limited service in the early years of World War II. Despite its limited operational history, the XS2L is recognized as a pioneering design, and has been cited as an influence on later aircraft such as the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and Curtiss P-40 Warhawk.

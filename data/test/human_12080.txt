Mark Hovell (21 March 1888 â€“ 12 August 1916) was a lecturer in history at the Victoria University of Manchester and the Workers Educational Association. He was an officer in The Sherwood Foresters during the First World War and was killed in action in only his second time in the trenches, after he fell down a shaft which had been used to explode a mine under the German lines. His book on Chartism, which he had begun before the war, was completed and published posthumously in 1918. It was one of the first scholarly works on the subject and one of the first to have been written by someone who was not a first-hand witness to events. Early life Mark Hovell was born in Manchester on 21 March 1888, the son of William and Hannah Hovell, of Brooklands, Cheshire, apparently in humble circumstances. He won a scholarship to the Manchester Grammar School at the age of ten. Circumstances forced him to leave school to work at age 12 but he returned in August 1901 as a pupil-teacher at Moston Lane Municipal School. Overcoming serious illness, he won the Hulme Scholarship to the Victoria University of Manchester in June 1906 and enrolled as a history undergraduate that October. He graduated with a first class degree in 1909. In 1910, he took the Teachers' Diploma.

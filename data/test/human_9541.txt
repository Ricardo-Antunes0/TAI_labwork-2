The Hyllie Water Tower, in the Hyllie district of the Swedish city of Malmö, was designed by the architect Karl Ivar Stål for Kjessler & Mannerstråle (now part of WSP Sweden) and completed in 1973. The tower is white and has the shape of a flying saucer. It is  high and holds  of water. It is operated by the local water organisation for southeastern Skåne, VA SYD, and has a small public park at its base. It is Malmö's newest water tower, and its design the result of the winning proposal in an architectural competition. The proposal called "Drabant" was carried out by Kjessler & Mannerstråle from Stockholm. Its construction cost was 8.6 million SEK. Hyllie Water Tower, which is by the Øresundståg railway line and one of the first things which can be seen after entering Sweden from Denmark, is a popular Malmö symbol and is lit blue at night, or other colours for special occasions. The ground level is about  above sea level.

Van Pelt Manor was the name given to the home of the Van Pelt family in Springfield, Massachusetts. The original home was built in 1775 and was located on a prominent hill overlooking the city. The home was passed down through the generations and was eventually destroyed by fire in 1872. A new home was built on the same site and is still in use today.  The Van Pelt family was one of the most important families in Springfield during the 18th and 19th centuries. The father of the family, Peter Van Pelt, was a wealthy merchant and politician who served as mayor of Springfield several times. His son, John Van Pelt, was a successful lawyer who became one of the state's most influential judges. The Van Pelt family also had a number of notable descendants, including Abigail Adams Van Pelt, who was an early feminist and abolitionist; James Buchanan Van Pelt, who served as the 24th president of the United States; and Roger Sherman Van Pelt, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.

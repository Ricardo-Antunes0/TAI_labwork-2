Courage was a German feminist newspaper published from Hamburg from 1892 to 1921. The paper was known for its combative journalism and for its support of women's rights.  Courage was first published on 10 March 1892 as a broadsheet newspaper. It was originally owned and edited by Margarete Steffens and Helene St√∂cker. The paper quickly became known for its combative journalism, and its support of women's rights. In 1902, the paper merged with Die Freie Welt, becoming one of the leading feminist newspapers in Germany. Courage remained independent until 1921, when it was forced to close down due to financial difficulties.  Courage played an important role in the fight for women's rights in Germany. It was one of the first newspapers to campaign for women's suffrage, and it was also one of the first newspapers to promote the idea of women's education. The paper also played a role in the fight against child labour, and it was one of the first newspapers to campaign for equal pay for women.  Today, Courage is considered an important historical document, and it is still widely read in Germany.

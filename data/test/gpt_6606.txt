In Germany's federal electoral system, coalition governments are the norm. There are three types of governing coalitions in Germany: the grand coalition, the minority coalition, and the coalition of the Future. A grand coalition is a coalition between the two largest parties in the Bundestag. The two largest parties are always the CDU/CSU and the SPD. A minority coalition is a coalition between one or more smaller parties and one or more of the two larger parties. The smaller party(s) usually get a number of cabinet posts. A coalition of the Future is a coalition between two or more small parties and one or more of the two larger parties. This type of coalition is not common in Germany, but has been formed twice in recent history.

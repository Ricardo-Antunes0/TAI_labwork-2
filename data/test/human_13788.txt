Dilson Domingos Funaro (October 23, 1933 — April 12, 1989) was a Brazilian businessman and politician, owner of the toy company Indústria de Brinquedos Trol. He was also president of the Brazilian Development Bank and later Finance Minister of Brazil during the term of President José Sarney, from August 1985 to April 1987. During his tenure as Finance Minister he was responsible for the creation of a plan for the stabilization of Brazil's monetary policy, the Plano Cruzado. He also was responsible for the unilateral suspension of payments on the Brazilian Republic's external debt to foreign financial institutions, which was implemented on February 20, 1987. With Brazil's financial crisis continuing with seemingly no solution on the horizon, Funaro was asked to resign from his post just a few months later. Personal life Funaro was the son of Paschoal Funaro and Helena Kraljevic, and grandson of Domingos Funaro (a native of Catanzaro, Calabria, Italy). Coming from a wealthy family, he studied engineering at Mackenzie Presbyterian University, and while still at a young age joined CIBRAPE, an industrial concern specialized in plastics. Not long after he acquired Monitora and later , a major manufacturer of plastics for industry, domestic use, and toys.

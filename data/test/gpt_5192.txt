Varahagiri Venkata Giri (; 10 August 1894 â€“ 15 January 1977) was an Indian mathematician and author who made major contributions to the theory of Lie groups and their applications in physics, engineering, and mathematics.  Giri was born in a Telugu Brahmin family in the town of Guntur in Andhra Pradesh, India. After completing his secondary education in Guntur, he moved to Madras, where he completed his undergraduate studies at Presidency College, then a part of the University of Madras. He then undertook graduate studies at the University of Chicago, where he received his doctorate in 1921 under the supervision of fellow Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan.  After returning to India, Giri taught at the University of Madras until 1934, when he was appointed professor of mathematics at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), a post he held until his retirement in 1966. He served as president of the Indian National Congress (INC) from 1962 to 1964.  Varahagiri Venkata Giri was awarded the Fields Medal in 1954 and the Abel Prize in 1970. He was honoured with the Presidential Award for Outstanding Contribution to Research in 1978. In 2005, JNU renamed its mathematics department after him.  Giri died on 15 January 1977 at the age of 84.

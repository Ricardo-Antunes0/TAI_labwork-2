The Convention on International Transport of Goods Under Cover of TIR Carnets (TIR Convention) is a multilateral treaty that was concluded at Geneva on 14 November 1975 to simplify and harmonise the administrative formalities of international road transport. (TIR stands for "Transports Internationaux Routiers" or "International Road Transports".) The 1975 convention replaced the TIR Convention of 1959, which itself replaced the 1949 TIR Agreement between a number of European countries. The conventions were adopted under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). As of December 2020, there are 77 parties to the Convention, including 76 states and the European Union. The TIR Convention establishes an international customs transit system with maximum facility to move goods:  in sealed vehicles or containers;  from a customs office of departure in one country to a customs office of destination in another country;  without requiring extensive and time-consuming border checks at intermediate borders;  while, at the same time, providing customs authorities with the required security and guarantees.

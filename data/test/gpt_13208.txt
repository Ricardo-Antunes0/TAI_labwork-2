In the Apple macOS operating system, a package is a file that stores one or more applications and related files. A package can be stored in the local file system, in the user's home directory, or on a remote computer.  Packages are an important part of macOS because they allow users to install multiple applications at once and keep them organized. They also allow for easy updates and removal of applications.  When a user downloads an application from the App Store, the installer package that is created contains the application and any related files. The installer package is automatically copied to the user's home directory during installation.  Packages can also be stored on a remote computer. This is useful when a user needs to install an application that is not available on their local machine. The installer package can be downloaded from the App Store, copied to a remote computer, and installed using the MacOS Installer program.

Lê Anh Tông (chữ Hán: 黎英宗; 1532–1573), also known as Lê Lợi, was a Vietnamese emperor who ruled from 1560 to 1567. He was the last emperor of the Mạc dynasty and is considered to be one of Vietnam's greatest emperors.  Lê Anh Tông was born in 1532, the son of Emperor Lê Thánh Tông and Empress Thuị Trang. He succeeded his father to the Mạc throne in 1560 at the age of only nine years old, after his father's death during the campaign against the Kingdom of Java. Early in his reign, he faced a rebellion led by General Trịnh Khánh. Despite initial success, Khánh was eventually defeated by Tông's forces at the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ in 1562.  Tông continued to strengthen his grip on power, and in 1567 he declared himself an absolute monarch, deposing his mother and her supporters from the government. He died three years later in 1573 and was succeeded by his younger brother Nguyễn Phúc Văn.

Bethesda  is a village in Belmont County, Ohio, United States. It is part of the Wheeling, West Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,256 at the 2010 census. History Bethesda has had three names: Burrs Mills, Fairmount, and Bethesda. When the railroad reached the village in 1852, the Central Ohio Railroad built a station and named it Burr's Mills in honor of Merrick S. Burr, who operated a sawmill in the area. In 1855, Burr laid out a village which he called Fairmount because of its high and beautiful location. Prior to that time, there was a store, the Bethesda Methodist Church, and a post office, all located about 2 miles south of the current town on what now CR 26, and the post office was named after the church. The store proprietor was the postmaster and when he moved his store to the town, the post office also was relocated but retained its name.  As a result, the town was called Fairmount while the railroad station was Burr's Mills and the post office was Bethesda.  In the late 1800s, the name of Bethesda was finally chosen for the town. Bethesda was incorporated as a village in 1910.  In 1920, the town contracted with the E. Howard Watch & Clock Company to supply a town clock which was dedicated to Bethesda's World War I veterans, and erected atop the Orrison Cigar Co. building on Main Street.  In 2010, the town clock was removed from service and placed in storage.  In 2015, a local coal miner from Bethesda, Mr. Robert E. Murray, spearheaded the restoration of the clock and established the Murray Family Memorial Plazza.  The facility and the restored clock have been dedicated to military veterans from all services and have been described as the "Times Square of Bethesda".

Edward Wynne (born 3 June 1961) is an English guitarist and keyboardist best known as a founding member, principal composer and the only constant member of psychedelic rock band Ozric Tentacles. Biography Ed Wynne was born in Wandsworth, London, England, and is the son of English sculptor David Wynne, and the grandson of English author Joan Grant. Family friend and late Beatles guitarist, George Harrison, encouraged a seven year old Wynne to pick up the guitar. Wynne's father regularly had big names in music, such as Jimi Hendrix and Donovan, stay over at the house. The family's emphasis on art and music allowed Wynne to achieve a wide range of musical appreciation, including Gong/Steve Hillage, Hawkwind, Kraan, Frank Zappa, and Todd Rundgren. In addition to Hendrix, Hillage and Zappa, other guitarists who have influenced Wynne include Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Guthrie Govan, who Wynne called "my favourite guitarist in the world at the moment" in 2021.

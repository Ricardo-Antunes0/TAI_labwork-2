Alkaased (foaled 19 February 2000) is an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning the 2005 Japan Cup in a then world record time. In a racing career which lasted from September 2002 until November 2005, he won six of his sixteen races and finished second on seven occasions. In his first three seasons he made steady improvement, winning the Old Newton Cup and the Glorious Stakes in 2004. In the following year he developed into a world-class middle-distance performer, winning the Jockey Club Stakes in England and the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud in France before beating a strong international field in the Japan Cup. After his retirement from racing he has stood as a breeding stallion in Japan and England. Background Alkaased is a bay horse with no white markings bred by Robin Scully's Clovelly Farms at Lexington, Kentucky. Alkaased's sire, Kingmambo was a highly successful breeding stallion. His progeny included the British Classic winners Russian Rhythm, King's Best, Henrythenavigator, Virginia Waters and Rule of Law as well as major winners in Japan (El Condor Pasa), France (Divine Proportions) and the United States (Lemon Drop Kid). Alkaased's dam Chesa Plana raced in Germany where she finished second in five Group races including the Grosser Preis von Berlin. As a descendant of the broodmare Mesopatamia, she came from the same branch of Thoroughbred family 10-c which produced Mastery, Galaxy Libra (Sunset Handicap, Man o' War Stakes), Halling, Cherokee Rose (Haydock Sprint Cup, Prix Maurice de Gheest) and Balla Cove (Middle Park Stakes, Round Table Handicap).

Chinese Indonesians  and colloquially Chindos, are Indonesians whose ancestors arrived from China at some stage in the last eight centuries. Chinese people and their Indonesian descendants have lived in the Indonesian archipelago since at least the 13th century. Many came initially as sojourners (temporary residents), intending to return home in their old age.<ref>{{cite book|author=Wang Gungwu|chapter=Sojourning: the Chinese experience in Southeast Asia'|editor=Anthony Reid|title=Sojourners and settlers: histories of Southeast Asia and the Chinese|location=Honolulu|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|date= 1996|pages=1â€“9}}</ref> Some, however, stayed in the region as economic migrants. Their population grew rapidly during the colonial period when workers were contracted from their home provinces in Southern China. Discrimination against Chinese Indonesians has occurred since the start of Dutch colonialism in the region, although government policies implemented since 1998 have attempted to redress this. Resentment of ethnic Chinese economic aptitude grew in the 1950s as Native Indonesian merchants felt they could not remain competitive. In some cases, government action propagated the stereotype that ethnic Chinese-owned conglomerates were corrupt. Although the 1997 Asian financial crisis severely disrupted their business activities, reform of government policy and legislation removed a number of political and social restrictions on Chinese Indonesians.

Charles Wyndham Watson (August 30, 1915 in Allendale, Michigan – April 20, 1998 in Santa Barbara, California) was an American theoretical physicist.  Watson was a graduate of the University of Michigan (B.S., 1936) and the University of Chicago (M.S., 1937). He was a research associate at Caltech from 1937 to 1941, and a professor of physics at the University of Chicago from 1941 to 1965. He was Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey from 1965 to 1968 and a professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara from 1968 until his death.  Watson is noted for his work on quantum field theory and statistical mechanics, in particular on the Erice problem and the Bohm–Vaclavik theory. He also made significant contributions to the theory of condensed matter and to the theory of superconductivity.

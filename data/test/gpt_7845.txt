Mir Ali Ahmed Khan Talpur (died April 6, 1851), better known as Ali Ahmad Talpur, was a religious and political leader of the Talpur dynasty in colonial India.  Born in the town of Mianwali in the Punjab region of British India, Talpur rose to prominence as a religious and political leader in the days leading up to the Indian Rebellion of 1857. He served as the Governor of Sindh and as the first Prime Minister of the United Provinces, serving from 1860 until his death a few months later.  Talpur's legacy is mixed; on the one hand he is credited with laying the foundations for modern Pakistan, while on the other he is remembered for his authoritarian rule and for his role in the Indian Rebellion.

Lampong Sheanghah (LS), a small village with about 120 households located in the Eastern part of Nagaland, India under Mon district. It is located  away from the district headquarter. The name 'Lampong' literally means 'junction' that connects Longwa village, the international border between India and Myanmar in the East, Assam in the West and Mon in the South-East. The distance between the village and the state capital Kohima is 354 km (and the nearest town of neighbouring state Sonari is 60 km far away). History During the head hunting era in 1890s, some precious ornaments (gongs, elephant tusks etc.) were stolen from Mon Village. Those thieves were apprehended by Sheanghah Tangten Villagers and returned the stolen ornaments to Mon village. As a token of gratitude and appreciation, the people of Mon village invited the Sheanghah people to come and settle in their own backyard. Consequently, people from both Tangten and Sheanghah Chingnyu made a new settlement in the land of Mon Village under the name 'Lampong Sheanghah'. That's how the village came into being in Mon area descended from Sheanghah Chingnyu. The inhabitants of the village are called 'Thohah'.

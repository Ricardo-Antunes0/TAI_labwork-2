John Baird Tyson, , (7 April 1928, in Philadelphia – 17 October 2006, in Princeton, New Jersey) was an American mathematician who made significant contributions to the theory of operator algebras and functional analysis.  Tyson earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1948, and his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1952 under the direction of André Weil. After postdoctoral research at MIT, he became a faculty member at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1955. In 1978 he moved to Rutgers University, where he remained until his retirement in 1994.  Tyson is best known for his work on operator algebras and functional analysis; his most important contributions include the development of the abstract matrix theory of operator algebras, and the construction of a new class of self-adjoint operators on Banach spaces. He also made significant contributions to the theory of semisimple Lie groups and is credited with first proving the existence of a semisimple self-adjoint linear operator on a semisimple Lie group which is not Hermitian.

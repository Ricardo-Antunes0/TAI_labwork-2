The Wright-Hargreaves Mine is a gold mine located in the town of Wright in the Yukon Territory, Canada. The mine has produced over 1 million ounces of gold since its discovery in 1898.  The mine was founded by two Englishmen, John Wright and William Hargreaves, in 1898. It was one of the first mines in the Yukon Territory and at its peak employed 500 people. However, owing to the decline in world gold prices the mine closed in 2003. Today, it is operated by Klondike Gold Rush Historical Park.

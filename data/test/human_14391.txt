Cromwell House is a Grade I listed building built in 1638 in Highgate Village, now a suburb of London.  It is currently owned by the Republic of Ghana and used as its visa section. The builder of the house Cromwell House was commissioned by Sir Richard Sprignell, who was born about 1603, the eldest son of Robert Sprignell, Esquire (1560â€“1624) and Susan Daniell, and was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he matriculated in January 1620 aged seventeen and graduated BA in February 1622. On the death of his parents in 1627, Sprignell inherited some houses in Whitefriars Street, two manors in Essex, Great and Little Maldon, and one in Yorkshire, Copmanthorpe, and some property in Middlesex, described as "dwelling house, yards, backsides, gardens, Palefield and four other fields adjoining... in the parish of Harringay alias Hornsey". In 1634, Sprignell was commissioned as a Captain of Train-Bands and in 1639 became a governor of Highgate grammar school. In 1641, Charles I created him a Baronet.

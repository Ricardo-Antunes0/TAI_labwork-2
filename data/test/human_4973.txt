Mary Porter Gamewell (née, Mary Porter; missionary pseudonym until marriage, Mary Q. Porter; October 20, 1848 – November 27, 1906) was an American missionary, teacher, speaker, and writer who founded a school for girls in Peking, China. She was the first missionary sent out by the Western Branch of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, and the first missionary that the organization sent to China. At that time, the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church had but five missionaries in the world, and she was one of them. She traveled from Davenport, Iowa to Peking, China in 1871 and started a school for girls, the institution opening with only one girl. It grew very slowly, more so because it was the first school in China to unbind the feet of the girl, an act that engendered great prejudice. By the time of the Boxer Rebellion, the school for girls, which Porter (now Gamewell) referred to as the "Davenport school", had 150 pupils enrolled. Early life and education

John Cameron (May 1764 – September 28, 1828), also known as the Black Cameron, was a prominent chief of the Métis people in the early 19th century. He was one of the most influential chiefs of his time and played a leading role in the development of the Métis nation.  Cameron was born in what is now Manitoba, Canada in 1764. He was one of eleven children born to George Cameron and Antoinette Bourgeois. His father was a French-speaking voyageur and trader who had settled among the Métis people. As a young man, Cameron became involved in the fur trade and worked for various companies throughout the North-West region of Canada. He first came to public attention during the Red River Rebellion of 1869–70, when he led a force of Métis fighters against the Canadian government. Following the rebellion's suppression, Cameron spent several years living in exile in the United States.  Upon his return to Canada, Cameron became one of the country's most powerful chiefs. He played a leading role in negotiations between the government and the Métis people, and he helped to secure their rights as a nation. He died in 1828 at age 72 after suffering from illness for several years.

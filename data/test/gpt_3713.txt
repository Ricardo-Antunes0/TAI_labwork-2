Forgiveness, in a psychological sense, is the process of reconciling a sense of anger, resentment, or revenge with an intention to forgive.  The act of forgiving may restore relationships and calm feelings of animosity. Forgiveness allows for a healing of the wounds caused by the original event or hurt feelings associated with it. It may also enable people to move on from the event, and may lead to positive changes in the attitudes and behavior of those involved.  The forgiveness process can be difficult, but it can be an essential part of rebuilding relationships. There are many reasons why forgiving an offender may be difficult, including lingering anger, guilt, and sadness. However, forgiveness is possible if the person feels that it is in the best interests of themselves and the offender.  Forgiveness is not always easy or straightforward, but it is an important part of human relationships.

Football is the most popular sport in Peru. It is also the most popular sport in Latin America. The Peruvian Football Federation is the governing body for football in Peru. It was founded in 1909 and has been a member of FIFA since 1923. Peru has won a total of 41 international titles, including 18 Copa América Championships, 7 CONMEBOL World Cups, and 5 Intercontinental Cups. The national team has also finished second in the Copa América twice, and fourth in the World Cup.   The origins of football in Peru can be traced back to 1887, when a group of students at the National University of San Marcos played a game of football on campus. The first organised football match took place in Lima on 15 November 1894, between two teams formed by employees of the Teatro Cusco. In 1895, a league was established in Lima, with teams representing various business sectors. The first championship was held that year, and Peruvian club Sporting CP emerged as the champion. However, football did not become popular nationwide until after World War I, when soldiers returning from the war began playing informal matches on street corners. In 1923, the Peruvian Football Federation was founded and joined FIFA. In 1941, Peru won its first international title when it won the Copa América Championship. The country's most recent international title was won in 1987 when it became champions of the Copa América Centenario.

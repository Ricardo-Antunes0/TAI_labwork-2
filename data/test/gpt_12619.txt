Himmelev was first mentioned in a document from 1204 as an area belonging to a convent on the banks of the River PÃ¤rnu. In 1322 it became part of a manor belonging to Bishop Johannes de Regibus. The manor house was destroyed by fire in 1571 and never rebuilt. Himmelev remained predominantly agricultural until after World War II when it began to be developed as a residential area.   The area has a number of heritage buildings, including a 19th century Lutheran church, which was restored in 2001-2002. There is also a park and a playground.

The Great Oxidation Event (GOE), also called the Great Oxidizing Event or Great Oxidation, is the name given to a period of atmospheric change that took place during the Paleozoic Era, lasting from about 2.5 to 1.8 billion years ago.  The GOE was a period of extreme environmental change during which the Earth's atmosphere became enriched in oxygen, leading to the evolution of complex life forms. The event is often cited as a key event in the evolution of life on Earth, and is considered one of the most significant moments in geological history.

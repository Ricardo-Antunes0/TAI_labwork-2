As of 1990, manufacturing in Chad was confined almost exclusively to the production of textiles and apparel. However, in recent years Chad has made significant advances in its manufacturing sector, with the establishment of a number of high-technology and heavy industry firms.  Chad's manufacturing sector is composed of a range of industrial sectors, including textiles and apparel, metal products, chemicals, and engineering. Chad's main exports are cotton textiles and garments, phosphates, coffee, and oil.   The government has endeavored to promote the development of Chad's manufacturing sector by providing support for new firms and by reforming the country's taxation system. In addition, the government is promoting increased cooperation between Chadian firms and their foreign counterparts.

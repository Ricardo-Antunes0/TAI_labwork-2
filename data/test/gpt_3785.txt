"Strandzha" was an revolutionary organization of immigrants in the United States formed in 1990. Its goals were to improve the quality of life for immigrants and to advocate for their rights. The organization was founded by leaders of the Albanian diaspora in the United States, and its members were primarily from Albania, Kosovo, and Macedonia.  Strandzha was one of the first organizations in the United States to focus exclusively on the needs of immigrants. It helped to create awareness of immigrant issues and organized protests and campaigns to improve the quality of life for immigrants. In addition, Strandzha helped to create links between immigrant communities and their native countries.  The organization was active until 2000, when it merged with another organization, Fight For Families. After its demise, Strandzha left a legacy of activism and advocacy for immigrants in the United States.

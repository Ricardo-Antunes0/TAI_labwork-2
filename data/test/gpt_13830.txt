Lilian Leveridge (15 April 1879 â€“ 1953) was an English mathematician and logician who made significant contributions to the foundations of mathematics and theoretical computer science. Leveridge developed the first algorithm for solving polynomial optimization problems, and is considered one of the fathers of modern mathematical optimization.  Leveridge was born in London on 15 April 1879, the eldest of three children of the Reverend Charles Leveridge and his wife, Frances. After completing her education at home, she entered Girton College, Cambridge in 1898, graduating with a double first in mathematics and classical studies in 1901. She then went on to study at the University of Berlin under Felix Klein and David Hilbert, earning her doctorate in 1905. During her time at Berlin, she also worked as a research assistant to Hilbert and Gustav Mittag-Leffler.  Leveridge returned to Cambridge in 1905 and became a lecturer at Somerville College. In 1910 she was appointed Professor of Mathematics at University College London (UCL), where she remained until her retirement in 1947. At UCL, she was also head of the mathematics department from 1932 to 1947. In 1931 she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).  Leveridge died on 9 May 1953 in London.  Lilian Leveridge is best known for her work in mathematical optimization, which has led to significant advances in computer science. Her work on algorithm theory laid the groundwork for modern optimization techniques, while her work on the theory of types provides a foundation for type theory

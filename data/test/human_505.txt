A shell scrape, also referred to as a "shallow grave" or "ranger grave", is a type of military earthwork both long and deep enough to lie flat in. While similar to a defensive fighting position in that the purpose is to shield a single soldier from artillery, mortar and direct small arms fire, it is not intended to be used for fighting from. Shell scrapes are generally hastily excavated manually, with immediately available means such as the entrenching tool, and are temporary constructions. They are shallow, and large enough to accommodate at least a single soldier lying down or kneeling.  In some situations they can be dug to accommodate two soldiers and their equipment.  For protection from the elements a poncho is often tied off / staked out at the edges or bungeed to a nearby tree.  This way a soldier can sleep in his shell scrape more comfortably with cover overhead.

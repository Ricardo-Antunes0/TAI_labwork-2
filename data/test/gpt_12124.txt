Foss v Harbottle (1843) 2 Hare 461, is a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council which established the law of contract in England.  The case was heard before Lord Ellenborough, in 1843. The plaintiff, Foss, had sold land to the defendant, Harbottle, and had agreed to sell it back to him for £500 if Harbottle ever went into bankruptcy. However, Harbottle failed to keep his end of the bargain, and sued Foss for breach of contract. The jury found in favour of Foss, and the defendant was ordered to pay him £500 damages.

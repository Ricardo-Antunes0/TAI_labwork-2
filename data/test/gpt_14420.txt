Pavasarininkai was the informal name for members of the Lithuanian intelligentsia who were active in the Russian Empire during the 18th century. The term derives from the Russian пава́сининка, meaning "pavilion-dweller."  The Pavasarininkai included scholars, artists, and intellectuals who worked in various fields of Russian culture. They were particularly active in the field of theater, and produced some of the most important works of Russian stage drama. Many of them also served as courtiers or diplomats.

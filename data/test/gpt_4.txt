Bilateral relations between modern-day Armenia and the Russian Federation have been characterised by tension and hostility since the early days of the Russian Empire. The two nations have had a tumultuous relationship since the end of World War I, when Armenia was forced to cede its historic territories in the Caucasus to the Soviet Union as part of the Moscow Peace Treaty. Russia has been accused of using Armenia as a pawn in its efforts to control the former Soviet Union's former Muslim republics, and has been frequently accused of human rights violations in the country. In recent years, however, relations between Armenia and Russia have improved somewhat, as both sides have sought to improve economic ties.

Trochodendron drachukii is an extinct species of flowering plants in the family Trochodendraceae known from a fossil fruiting structure found in the early Ypresian age Eocene fossils found in British Columbia, Canada. T. drachukii is one of the oldest members of the genus Trochodendron, which includes the living species T. aralioides, native to Japan, southern Korea and Taiwan and the coeval extinct species T. nastae from Washington state, United States. History and classification Description of the new species by Dr. Kathleen Pigg, Richard Dillhoff, Melanie DeVore and Wesley Wehr was based on the study of a single complete fruiting structure specimen. The holotype fossil, number "UWBM 97819", being housed in the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, Seattle, Washington. They published their 2007 type description of the species in the International Journal of Plant Sciences volume number 168 and named the species drachukii in honor of Robert Drachuck in recognition for his finding and donation of the type specimen for study. The holotype was recovered from the Ypresian age Tranquille Formation outcropping at the McAbee Fossil Beds near Cache Creek, BC, which is designated the type locality.

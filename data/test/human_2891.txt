Maria de Lourdes Mazzoleni Portela (born 14 January 1988) is a Brazilian middleweight judoka. She won bronze medals at the 2011 and 2015 Pan American Games, and competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics.  At the 2012 Olympics, she lost her first match to Yuri Alvear.  At the 2016 Games, she beat Assmaa Niang in the first round, before losing to Bernadette Graf in the second. In 2020, she won the gold medal in the women's 70 kg event at the 2020 Pan American Judo Championships held in Guadalajara, Mexico. The following year, Portela represented Brazil at the 2020 Summer Olympics. She competed in the women's 70 kg event, being controversially eliminated in the second round against Madina Taimazova, in a ten minute golden score overtime where one hit that would have given Portela a win was dismissed by the referees, and also was part of the mixed team competition.

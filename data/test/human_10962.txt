Barbara Jane Garrison (born March 7, 1949) is an American chemist who is Emeritus Professor at Pennsylvania State University. She is the former Shapiro Professor of Chemistry and Head of the Department. She is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, American Chemical Society, American Association for the Advancement of Science and American Vacuum Society. Early life and education  Garrison was born in Big Rapids, Michigan.  Her father, "Gary" Garrison, was a medic during World War II. Upon returning to the United States, he studied at Ferris State University, the first in his family to attend college. Her mother grew up in Missouri. In 1956, the Garrison family moved to Phoenix, Arizona. She was encouraged by her father to work on maths and physics. As a teenager, Garrison played clarinet in the marching band, and was involved with the Girl Scouts of the USA. She attended Camelback High School, where she eventually decided to focus on physics. She graduated as one of the top five students in the class, and was awarded a scholarship to attend the Arizona State University. She majored in physics and maths, but took her quantum mechanics classes in chemistry. After graduating, she moved to the University of California, Berkeley, where she realized she was interested in the physics of molecules. She transferred her speciality to chemistry, and worked on Penning ionization. During her graduate degree, she started to work with IBM in San Jose on molecular modeling. After graduating, Garrison joined Purdue University.

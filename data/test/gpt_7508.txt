Tradecraft, within the intelligence community, refers to the various techniques and procedures used to acquire, investigate, analyze, and exploit intelligence. These techniques include espionage, counterespionage, tradecraft sabotage, counterintelligence, human intelligence, and electronic intelligence.  The tradecraft employed by intelligence officers depends on the source of the information they are investigating. For example, spies who collect information through espionage must use different tradecraft than those who collect information through counterespionage. Similarly, tradecraft used to collect human intelligence may be different than that used to collect electronic intelligence.  Tradecraft is a term that has been used within the intelligence community for many years. The first known use of the term was in the early 1950s. The National Security Agency (NSA) created a manual called "Tradecraft for the Intelligence Professional" in 1954. The manual was revised in 1974 and again in 1983.  Today, tradecraft is used throughout the intelligence community to protect both U.S. national security and individual officers' privacy. Tradecraft is also used to protect the identity of informants and sources, and to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

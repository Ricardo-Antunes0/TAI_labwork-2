The Pennsylvania Line Mutiny was a mutiny that took place on board the USS Constitution on July 4, 1797. The mutiny was led by a group of junior officers who objected to the captain's attempt to run the ship aground on a sandbar off Cape Hatteras. The mutineers were eventually suppressed and most were court-martialed.  The Pennsylvania Line Mutiny was a significant event in United States naval history. It marked the first time that a mutiny had occurred on board an American vessel, and it served as a warning to other officers about the dangers of disobeying orders. The mutineers were ultimately punished with harsh punishments, including confinement to hard labor on board the ship. This event also demonstrated the effectiveness of Captain John Barry's leadership skills in suppressing the rebellion.

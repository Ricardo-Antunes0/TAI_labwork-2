Subiaco Oval (; nicknamed Subi) was a stadium in the Australian city of Perth, used mostly for Australian rules football. It was located in the suburb of Subiaco, about 4 kilometres west of the central business district.  The stadium was first used for Australian rules football in 1897 and was originally known as the "Subiaco Recreation Ground". The name was changed to the "Subiaco Oval" in 1938. It seated around 10,000 people and was used primarily for local competitions. In 1977, it underwent a major redevelopment which increased its seating capacity to around 30,000. The stadium was closed in 1995 due to safety concerns after a series of spectator-related deaths. It has since been demolished and replaced by a new sports ground, the WACA Ground.

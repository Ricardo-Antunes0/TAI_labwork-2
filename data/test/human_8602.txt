Surf Factor 8 is the eighth album released by surf music band The Surfin' Lungs, released in 2016 on Redondo Records. All bar one of the 14 tracks are self-penned, with Clive and Ray – back on drums – contributing one song each, while there is a cover of "Babysitter" by The Ramones. A traditional Lungs album, with songs about the sun, sea, cars and girls, with a surf punk edge and a hard driving bass prevalent throughout, plus a nod to several influences including The Beach Boys, Gary Usher, Blondie and The Ramones.

Thomas Hyclak (born August 4, 1947) is an American composer and professor of music at the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas.  Hyclak was born in Dallas, Texas, to Polish immigrants. He studied music at the University of North Texas, where he received his B.M. in 1968 and his M.M. in 1973. He later studied with Nadia Boulanger at the Paris Conservatory and with Milton Babbitt at the University of California, Davis.  Hyclak's early works were influenced by minimalism, but he has since developed a vigorous and eclectic style that draws on elements of post-minimalism, contemporary classical music, jazz, and world music. His compositions have been performed throughout the United States and in Europe, Japan, Canada, and Mexico. He has served on the faculty of the University of North Texas since 1974.  Hyclak is married to pianist Suzanne Hyclak and they have two children.

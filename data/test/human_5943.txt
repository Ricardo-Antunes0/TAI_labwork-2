The Field Elm cultivar  Ulmus minor 'Concavaefolia' was briefly described by Loudon in Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum (1838), as Ulmus campestris var. concavaefolia. A fuller description followed in Petzold and Kirchner 's Arboretum Muscaviense (1864). Henry noted that Loudon's "insufficiently described" U. campestris var. concavaefolia seemed to be identical with the field elm cultivar 'Webbiana', a view repeated by Kr√ºssmann. Description Loudon thought the tree resembled his 'Cucullata' (probably the cultivar later called Ulmus montana cucullata Hort.). Petzold and Kirchner in Arboretum Muscaviense (1864) described the leaves of their Ulmus campestris concavaefolia, as short and rounded, dark green above and whitish green below, "more or less concave", that is, curling upwards at the edges so that the pale underside is more prominent than the darker upper (a description, as Henry noted, that matches 'Webbiana'). They noted that the leaves of their var. concavaefolia were smaller than those of their var. cucullata (again, probably Ulmus montana cucullata Hort.), but not dissimilar in shape.

Courtesan, in modern usage, is a euphemism for a prostitute. The term has been used since the fourteenth century, when it referred to a woman who entertained the court. The courtesan was a highly sought-after woman, who could be found in all social classes. She could be a noblewoman, a lady-in-waiting to a queen or princess, or even a street urchin. She earned her living by providing sexual services to her clients.

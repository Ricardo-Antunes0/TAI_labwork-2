He began playing the tenor saxophone in his early teens, and by the early 1930s had developed a strong following in the city's jazz scene. In 1935, Marvin moved to New York City, where he quickly established himself as one of the city's most prominent jazz performers. He worked extensively with leading figures in the genre, including Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and Bud Powell.  Marvin's career endured through the decades thanks to his dynamic virtuosity and expressive saxophone playing. He is perhaps best known for his collaborations with Miles Davis, who enlisted him to play on several of Davis' most acclaimed recordings.

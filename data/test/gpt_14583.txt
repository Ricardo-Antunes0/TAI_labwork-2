A timesheet (or time sheet) is a record of the hours worked by a person, typically in the form of a sheet of paper. Timesheets are used in both the public and private sectors for tracking employee hours.   Timesheets are important for two reasons: first, they help employers track the amount of time employees are working, and second, they can be used as evidence if an employee is later sued for overtime or other labor violations.

Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 (IE6) is a discontinued web browser released in 2001 as part of the Windows XP operating system. IE6 was superseded by IE7 in 2004.  IE6 was a major update over IE5, adding support for newer web standards and introducing new features such as Smart Tags and Protected Mode. However, it suffered from performance issues and was eventually discontinued in favor of IE7.  Today, IE6 is mostly used for historical purposes or for sites that do not support modern web standards.

Levin & Co Levin was born in Wellington, New Zealand, the son of English-born parents, Jessie (Hort) and Nathaniel William Levin (1819–1903), who were both Jewish. From Wellington, he ran the business W H Levin and Co, a stock and station agency and general mercantile suppliers founded there in 1841 by his father. W H Levin took over the business in 1868 aged only 22 when his father prepared for his own permanent return to London though it was in the event delayed until 1869. His first partners (for a ten-year term to March 1878) were C J Pharazyn, who withdrew early in 1871, and W W Johnston. After that he conducted the business on his own account as W H Levin until 1889 when he took in Edward Pearce and John Duncan as partners, both had previously managed the business, and it was renamed Levin & Co.

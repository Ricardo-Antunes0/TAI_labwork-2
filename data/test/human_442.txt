John Dilg (born 1945) is an American painter based in the Midwest. He is known for idiosyncratic landscapes created within a pared-down visual vocabulary that draws on memory, imagination, vernacular artifacts, and folk-art and art historical sources. Critics describe them as archetypal, dreamlike ruminations on place, nature and its fragility, the collective unconscious, and mystical storytelling.  Dilg's work belongs to several public collections, including those of the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, Figge Art Museum, Museu d'Art Contemporani Vicente Aguilera Cerni (Spain) and Arkansas Arts Center, and has been reviewed in Art in America, The New York Times, Hyperallergic, New Art Examiner, The Boston Globe, and HuffPost. Critic John Yau wrote that Dilg's landscapes "arise out of the collision of observation and memory, things seen and the history of painting remembered," and evoke an "otherworldly hush and reverence." Curator Terri C. Smith wrote, "Dilg makes objects that are at once na√Øve and sophisticated, familiar and enigmatic. The tension in the paintings between known and unknown, fine art and found art along with their small scale encourages a very intimate, personal viewing experience."

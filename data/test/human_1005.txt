Amateur geology or rock collecting (also referred to as rockhounding in the United States and Canada) is the non-professional study and hobby of collecting rocks and minerals or fossil specimens from the natural environment.  In Australia, New Zealand and Cornwall, the activities of amateur geologists are called fossicking.  The first amateur geologists were prospectors looking for valuable minerals and gemstones for commercial purposes.  Eventually, however, more people have been drawn to amateur geology for recreational purposes, mainly for the beauty that rocks and minerals provide. Accessibility One reason for the rise in popularity of amateur geology is that a collection can begin by simply picking up a rock.  There are also many clubs and groups that search for specimens and compare them in groups as a hobby.  Information on where to find such groups can be found at libraries, bookstores, and "gem and mineral shows". Tourist information centers and small-town chambers of commerce can also supply valuable local information. The Internet can also be a useful search tool as it can help find other amateur geologists.

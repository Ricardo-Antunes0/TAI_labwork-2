Oculometer is a device that tracks eye movement. The oculometer computes eye movement by tracking corneal reflection relative to the center of the pupil. An oculometer, which can provide continuous measurements in real time, can be a research tool to understand gaze as well as cognitive function. Further, it can be applied for hands-free control. It has applications in flight training, cognitive assessment, disease diagnosis, and treatment. The oculometer relies on the principle that when a collimated light beam is incident on the eye, the direction in which the eye moves is proportional to the position of the reflection of that light beam from the cornea with respect to the center of the pupil. Eye movements can be accurately measured over a linear range of more than 20 Â with a resolution of 0.1. History  Eye movement and tracking have been studied for centuries, with the very first eye tracking being simple observation of the eyes, by either oneself or another. The first improvement on this occurred in 1738, when an observer would feel the outside of closed eyelids to track eye movement. Next in 1879, an innovation to listen to muscle movements using a kymograph was implemented. Though rudimentary, these early techniques show repeated need throughout history to track eye movements.

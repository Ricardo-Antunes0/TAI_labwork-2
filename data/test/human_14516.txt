Jean Japart (fl. c. 1474 – 1481) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the Renaissance, active in Italy.  He was a popular composer of chansons, and may have been a friend of Josquin des Prez. Life and work Nothing is known about his life except for a brief period during the late 1470s, although it is probable he was born in Picardy.  He was one of the members of the famous Sforza chapel choir in Milan between 1474 and 1476, which included Alexander Agricola, Loyset Compère and Johannes Martini, the time when this institution had one of the most famous groups of singers and composers in Europe.  After the assassination of Galeazzo Sforza in 1476, he left Milan, as did most of the musicians; Japart went to Ferrara where he was quickly employed by Ercole I d'Este; not only did he become one of the most highly paid singers at the Ferrarese court, but the Duke gave him a house in Ferrara.  By 1481 he was gone, and there is no further record of him.

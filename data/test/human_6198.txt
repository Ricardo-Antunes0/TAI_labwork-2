Permission to Fly is the second and final studio album by American singer-songwriter Jordan Pruitt. On July 22, 2008, the album was released to all Limited Too stores only and in September the album was released on iTunes. On August 26, 2008 the album was given a physical release. The worldwide premiere of the album was broadcast over Radio Disney on July 19, 2008 at 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time and 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The encore also aired on July 21, 2008 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time and 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time. For unknown reasons, the album was removed from the iTunes Store on September 19, 2008. Background Before the release of "Permission to Fly," Pruitt had signed on as the spokesperson for several multi-media national marketing campaigns with Kraft Foods, Kimberly-Clark, Colgate-Palmolive, Samsung and the Limited Too brands. When picking songs for the album, Pruitt used her "5-second rule." If the track didn't grab her in five seconds, she didn't record it. Pruitt worked with a team of top songwriter/producers - including Shelly Peiken (Christina Aguilera, Michelle Branch, Keith Urban), Arnthor Birgisson (Enrique Iglesias, Celine Dion), Tim James & Antonina Armato (Miley Cyrus, Aly & AJ, Vanessa Hudgens), and Adam Watts & Andy Dodd (Jesse McCartney). Pruitt also co-wrote many of the songs. Jordan wanted the album to be more mature than her previous album, "I kind of grew up after the first record was done," she says. "I became more of myself. I really found out who I was and what I wanted to be."

The International Cystinuria Foundation (ICF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to funding research into the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cystinuria. The Foundation was founded in 1998 by a group of cystinuria sufferers and their families.  Cystinuria is a rare genetic disorder that results in the accumulation of cysteine in the urine. This can lead to serious health problems, including renal failure and even death. The Foundation aims to fund research into the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cystinuria, so that people with this disorder can enjoy a better quality of life.  The Foundation is also committed to raising awareness of cystinuria among the general public. We work with various organisations to promote education and awareness about cystinuria, and we provide support to people with cystinuria and their families. We hope that by funding research into cystinuria and promoting awareness among the public, we can make life easier for those who suffer from this disorder.

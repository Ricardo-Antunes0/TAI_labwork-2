"Honestly" is a song recorded by American Internet personality and singer Gabbie Hanna. It was independently released for digital download on August 15, 2018 simultaneously with its encore titled "Honestly (Encore)". Both tracks were written by Hanna and Lyre, while production was solely handled by the latter. The inspiration for their lyrics derives from a relationship the singer had had with a pathological liar. Musically, "Honestly" has been described as a pop punk song in which Hanna belts about empowerment. A music critic noted an "ominous and aggressive vibe". A double music video for "Honestly" and "Honestly (Encore)" was uploaded onto Hanna's YouTube channel on the same day of the songs' digital release and was directed by Ryan Parma. It features her performing choreography, and eventually she is shown tied up to a rack by white cloths and struggling to get away from two men. Reviewers praised the clip, with one comparing Hanna's dancing to that of Beyonc√©. Commercially, "Honestly" entered the download charts in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, and peaked at number 21 on Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart as well as at number 61 in Scotland. In the same territory, "Honestly (Encore)" peaked at number 86. For further promotion, Hanna delivered a live performance of "Honestly" at VidCon 2018 in Australia.

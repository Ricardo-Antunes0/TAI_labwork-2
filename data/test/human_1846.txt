Collingwood Football Club President Mark Korda was appointed to the board of directors at the Collingwood Football Club in May 2007, after five years at his company, KordaMentha.

Korda was announced as the thirteenth President of the Collingwood Football Club on April 21, 2021. Korda, having been in the role for less than a month, saw his Vice President at Collingwood, Alex Waislitz, resign effective immediately. His vacancy was filled by two co-vice presidents, Indigenous businesswoman Jodie Sizer and former Collingwood player Paul Licuria. Former cyclist and medical practitioner Bridie O'Donnell was appointed to the board following Waislitz's resignation. On September 15, 2021, having been on the Collingwood board for 120 days, O'Donnell resigned effective immediately, citing the magnitude of the role. On October 6, 2021, Korda announced his resignation as Collingwood Football Club President, but will remain in the role until December 16, 2021.

Richard Eugene Hoagland (born 1950, Fort Wayne, Indiana) is an American astronomer and professor of astronomy at the California Institute of Technology. He is known for his work on the origin and evolution of the solar system, including research on extrasolar planets and the hypothesis that the solar system's planets formed from a disk of dust and gas that surrounded the young sun.  Hoagland's work has been cited more than 2,000 times in scientific publications. He has also written or edited more than 20 books, including The Oort Cloud and Beyond (with David Morrison), The Evolution of Earth and Planetary Science (with Steven J. Dick), and The Nature of the Solar System (with Ronald Greeley).  Hoagland is a Fellow of both the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Royal Astronomical Society. In 2003 he was awarded the Carl Sagan Award from the SETI Institute.

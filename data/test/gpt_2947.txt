Humanistic capitalism is a concept that seeks to combine aspects of capitalism with those of humanism. It promotes a society in which individuals are able to achieve their full potential and contribute to society, while also benefiting from social welfare programs and the protection of civil rights.  Humanistic capitalism was first proposed by Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter in his book " Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance ". He defines humanistic capitalism as a business philosophy that combines the principles of market-based capitalism with those of humanistic values, such as individual responsibility and creativity.  Humanistic capitalism is not new. It has been advocated by figures such as John D. Rockefeller, who said, "It is more important to help people live than to help them die." However, modern humanistic capitalism is more focused on creating value for shareholders and less concerned with social issues.

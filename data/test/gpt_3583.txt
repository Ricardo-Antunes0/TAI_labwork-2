Enamelin is an enamel matrix protein (EMPs), a type of proteoglycan found in the cells of the body, notably in cartilage and bone. ESCs are a subset of collagens that are rich in the amino acid hydroxyproline.  Enamelin is a type of proteoglycan that is found in cells of the body, notably in cartilage and bone. ESCs are a subset of collagens that are rich in the amino acid hydroxyproline. Enamelin is also found as a component of dental enamel.  Enamelin is a key component of dental enamel. Dental enamel is the hard outer coating on teeth that protects them from damage by food and beverage ingestion and from environmental factors. The structure and composition of dental enamel is determined by the genes that are inherited from one's parents.  The primary role of enamelin is to provide mechanical support for dentin (the underlying mineralized tissue) and to enhance the adhesion between dentin and cementum (a layer of connective tissue that forms around each tooth). Enamelin also plays a role in regulating tooth wear and tear.

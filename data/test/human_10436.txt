Wilmer Watts (c. 1897 – August 21, 1943) was an American old time singer, banjo player and bandleader who recorded a series of records for Paramount Records in the 1920s. Biography Watts was born in Mount Tabor (now Tabor City) a market town in Columbus County, North Carolina, United States, between 1896 and 1898. After World War I he moved to the city of Belmont, North Carolina where he worked as a weaver in textile factories. Having learned several instruments including banjo, fiddle, guitar, dobro, autoharp, harmonica, musical saw and drums he became a semi-professional musician around 1921 and made his first recordings in January or February 1927 as a duo with local guitarist Charlie Wilson (1900–?) with a single entitled "The Sporting Cowboy" which was not released at the time. With a new trio under the name of Wilmer Watts and His Lonely Eagles they recorded six sides for Paramount Records in 1927 using a line-up that included Charles Freshour (1900–1959) on guitar and the then unusual steel guitar which was played by Wilson. In 1929 he returned to Paramount's New York studios. This time Wilson was replaced on steel guitar by Palmer Rhyne (1904–1967), a fellow factory worker friend of Watts. These sessions resulted in fourteen sides.

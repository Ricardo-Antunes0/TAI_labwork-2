The Junkers K 16 was a small, single-seat fighter aircraft used by the Luftwaffe in the late 1930s. It was designed as a cheap replacement for the earlier Junkers J 1 and was the last fighter design to be produced by Junkers before their bankruptcy in 1937.  The K 16 was a simple design, with a fixed, tailwheel undercarriage and a single engine in a tractor configuration. It was armed with a single machine gun. The K 16 had poor performance and was not particularly successful, although it remained in service until 1941.

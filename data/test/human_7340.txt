The Sparse Matrix Converter is an AC/AC converter which offers a reduced number of components, a low-complexity modulation scheme, and low realization effort.  Invented in 2001 by Prof Johann W. Kolar , sparse matrix converters avoid the multi step commutation procedure of the conventional matrix converter, improving system reliability in industrial operations.  Its principal application is in highly compact integrated AC drives. Characteristics Quasi-Direct AC-AC conversion with no DC link energy storage elements Sinusoidal input current in phase with mains voltage Zero DC link current commutation scheme resulting in lower modulation complexity and very high reliability Low complexity of power circuit / power modules available Ultra-Sparse Matrix Converter, does show very low realization effort, in case unidirectional power flow can be accepted (admissible displacement of 30Â° the input current fundamental and input voltage, as well as for the output voltage fundamental and output current), accordingly, a possible application area would be variable speed PSM drives of low dynamics.

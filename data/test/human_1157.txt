Keystone United, formerly known as the Keystone State Skinheads (KSS), is a neo-Nazi group based in Pennsylvania. The Southern Poverty Law Center stated that the group is one of the largest and most active single-state racist skinhead crews in the United States. According to the KSS website, the group had chapters in Harrisburg, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Erie, Scranton, Reading, Carlisle, Allentown and other cities in the state. KSS was featured in the National Geographic Channel documentary American Skinheads. In 2008, KSS changed its name to Keystone United. The number of its members remains unknown. The group's logos are a pit bull or a bulldog bordered by a chain or a Keystone symbol in the colors of the Nazi flag. History  Keystone State Skinheads was founded in late 2001 by five men from Harrisburg, PA. It originally focused on uniting white power skinheads throughout the regions of Pennsylvania. A second KSS chapter was founded in nearby Lancaster, which had a small group of white power skinheads who were part of a National Alliance youth group. Shortly after the formation of Lancaster's chapter, World Church of the Creator leader Matt Hale had announced plans to visit York, PA to speak at the public library. White supremacists were set upon by hundreds of Anti-Racist Action members and other anti-fascists outside the library. The Anti-Defamation League stated that: "KSS transformed itself from a mainly Harrisburg group to a network of seven regional crews that had members from every major city in the state and associates in New Jersey, Maryland and New York."

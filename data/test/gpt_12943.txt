Level3 (stylized as LEVEL3) is the fourth studio album by Japanese singer-songwriter Perfume. It was released on September 2, 2009, by Polydor Records.  The album was recorded at various studios in Tokyo and Kyoto, with the exception of the song "Nishikino Muneyasu", which was recorded at the DTM Studio in Germany. Level3 is Perfume's first album to not include any collaborations with long-time collaborator Yo-Yo.  The album has been noted for its more electronic and electronic rock oriented sound, as well as its more introspective lyrics.  "Level3" debuted at number one on the Oricon Albums Chart, selling 135,000 copies in its first week. It has since sold over 600,000 copies in Japan.  In October 2009, Level3 was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the 51st Grammy Awards. However, it lost to Taylor Swift's "Fearless".

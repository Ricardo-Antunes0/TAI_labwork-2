The G-less cassette transcription assay is a method used in molecular biology to determine promoter strength in vitro. The technique involves quantification of an mRNA product with the use of a plasmid. The G-less cassette is part of a pre-constructed vector, usually containing a multiple cloning site (MCS) upstream of the cassette. For this reason, promoters of interest can be inserted directly into the MCS to ultimately measure the accuracy and efficiency of a promoter in recruiting transcription machinery. Method The G-less cassette is a reporter gene that encodes a transcript lacking guanine nucleotides in the sense strand of the DNA (hence "G-less"). A plasmid containing such a gene  is located downstream of a MCS. After the promoter is inserted into the MCS, transcription proceeds with the addition of radiolabeled UTP, CTP, and ATP (as well as non-radiolabeled/cold nucleotides) and continues until the end of the G-less cassette is reached and guanine residues are once again apparent in the sense strand of the DNA. The absence of GTP in vitro results in transcription being prematurely terminated at the first guanine residue in the sense strand following the cassette. Gel electrophoresis is performed on the transcription products and the amount of radioactivity is quantified by autoradiography or phosphorimaging to determine the strength of the promoter of interest.

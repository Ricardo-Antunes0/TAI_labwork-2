In computer science, virtualization is a modern technology that allows multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single computer hardware platform. Virtualization abstracts the underlying physical hardware, providing one or more virtual machines (VMs) that act as if they are independent computers.  Virtualization technology can be found in a wide range of applications, including business, education, engineering, research, and system administration. It is also used in embedded systems and smart devices.

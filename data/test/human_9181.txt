The Nathaniel Hempstead House, also known as the Old Huguenot House, is a historic house museum on Hempstead Street in New London, Connecticut.  Built about 1759, it is an architecturally unusual stone house with a gambrel roof, a style not otherwise seen in the city.  Because of its unusual form, it was thought to have been built by French Huguenot immigrants at an earlier date.  The house is owned by Connecticut Landmarks, along with the adjacent Joshua Hempsted House, operating the pair as the Hempstead Houses museum.  The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 2, 1970. Description and history The Nathaniel Hempstead House is located west of downtown New London, set close to the road at the corner of Hempstead and Truman Streets.  It is a -story stone structure with a gambrel roof and brick end chimneys.  The walls are formed out of dressed granite laid in regular courses with mortar.  Its main facade is four bays wide, with the entrance in one of the center bays.  A single small shed-roof dormer projects from the rear roof's steep face.

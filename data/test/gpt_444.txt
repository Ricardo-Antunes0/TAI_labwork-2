Yuan Xun (元恂) (483–497), né Tuoba Xun (拓恂), was a Chinese poet and philosopher of the late Eastern Han dynasty. He is best known for his poetry, which is noted for its stark and powerful images, and for his essay "Treatise on the Human Condition", which has been called one of the most important works of Chinese philosophy.  Yuan Xun was born in 483 into a poor but distinguished family in what is now Hebei province. He began to study at an early age, and in 497 he passed the imperial examination and became a government official. However, he soon became disillusioned with the corrupt politics of the time and abandoned his career to become a poet.  From 499 to 502, Yuan Xun served as governor of Zhejiang province. While there, he wrote many of his most famous poems, including "The Wanderer" and "The Old Masters". In 502 he was appointed governor of Shandong province but only stayed there for a year before being recalled to serve as governor of Henan province. In 517 he was made minister of justice, a position he held until his death in 527.  Yuan Xun is best known for his poems, which are noted for their stark and powerful images. His essays, however, are also highly regarded, and have been called one of the most important works of Chinese philosophy.

Maternal hypothyroidism is hypothyroidism in pregnant mothers. It is a relatively rare condition, affecting about 1 in 1000 pregnant women.   Maternal hypothyroidism is caused by an insufficient amount of thyroid hormone, a hormone that is necessary for the normal functioning of the body's organs and tissues. The thyroid gland is located in the neck and produces thyroid hormone.   The most common symptom of maternal hypothyroidism is fatigue. Other symptoms may include weight gain, decreased muscle mass, hair loss, and depression. In some cases, maternal hypothyroidism may lead to miscarriage or stillbirth.   There is no cure for maternal hypothyroidism, but treatment may include a combination of medications and lifestyle changes. Treatment may include beta blockers to lower blood pressure, anti-depressants to treat mood swings, and thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

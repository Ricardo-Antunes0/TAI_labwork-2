Wulfstan the Cantor (c. 960 – early 11th century), was a leading English churchman of his time. He was Archbishop of Canterbury from 1093 to 1107, and was a leading figure in the reform movement within the church.  Wulfstan was born in 960, probably in Winchester. He was educated at Oxford, where he became a fellow of Oriel College in 986 and later its chancellor. In 1093 he was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, and during his time as archbishop he played a leading role in reforming the English church. He worked to improve the administration of the church and to increase its wealth. He also wrote religious works, including a life of Saint Augustine of Hippo and a treatise on the ecclesiastical law.  Wulfstan died in early 11th century and was buried at Canterbury Cathedral.

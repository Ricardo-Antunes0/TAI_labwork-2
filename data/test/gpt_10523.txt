The Großer Wannsee (, "Great Wannsee") is a lakeside villa in Berlin, Germany, where the Wannsee Conference took place on 20 January 1942 to plan theFinal Solution to the Jewish Question. The villa is now a museum.  The "Großer Wannsee" was built by businessman and art collector Fritz Klein between 1911 and 1913 on the site of an earlier hunting lodge of the Hardenberg family. Klein had bought the land from the Berlin municipality in 1910 and commissioned architect Walter Gropius to design a villa in the then-popular Jugendstil style. The villa was completed in 1913, and its interiors were designed by art nouveau architect Otto Wagner. It was originally known as "Villa Klein-Wannsee" after Klein's wife Wilhelmine von Hardenberg.  On 20 January 1942, representatives from Nazi Germany convened at the villa to plan the Final Solution to the Jewish Question. The meeting was chaired by Reinhard Heydrich, with Adolf Eichmann and others participating. The participants decided that European Jews would be systematically exterminated in gas chambers in extermination camps in what is known as the Holocaust.

The square is bounded by the old market hall, the churches of Saint Boniface and Saint Georg, the Franciscan monastery and the University of Münster. The Roggenmarkt is a popular tourist destination and a busy place for shopping.  The Roggenmarkt is located in the northeast corner of Münster's historic city center, on an ancient trade route between the Netherlands and central Europe. The square is bordered by the old market hall, the churches of Saint Boniface and Saint Georg, the Franciscan monastery and the University of Münster. The Roggenmarkt is a popular tourist destination and a busy place for shopping. It has a central fountain and several traditional beer gardens.  The Roggenmarkt was first mentioned in a document from 1158 as part of a larger trading complex that included markets in Egbertshausen and Mörsdorf. The present layout of the square was created in the 16th century when two smaller squares were merged into one large market area. The square was originally called "Zwingerplatz" (literally "cage square"), because it was located within the city walls of Münster. In medieval times, trade fairs were held on the square, which attracted merchants from all over Europe. In 1589, during the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther preached his first public sermon on the square.

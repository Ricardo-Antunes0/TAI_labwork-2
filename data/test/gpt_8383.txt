Ferguson is an unincorporated community in the Cariboo Country of British Columbia, Canada. It is located on the Cariboo Highway 4, south-east of Williams Lake.  Ferguson was first settled in the early 1880s by Mormons who had crossed the Continental Divide from Utah. The community was named after James Ferguson, one of the first settlers. A post office opened in Ferguson in 1886 and operated until 1959.  The town's economy was based on timber and agriculture until the late 1960s, when the construction of the Trans-Canada Highway brought more people to the area. Since then, Ferguson has developed as a service center for the surrounding rural area. The town has a small commercial district, a public library, and two churches.  Ferguson is home to the Ferguson Museum, which houses exhibits on local history and natural history.

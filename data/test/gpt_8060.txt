The Middle Magdalena Valley, Middle Magdalena Basin, or simply Middle Magdalena is a geological basin located in the southwestern United States. The basin covers parts of the states of New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah. The basin is bounded on the east by the Rocky Mountains, on the south by the San Juan Mountains, and on the west by the Wasatch Mountains.  The Middle Magdalena Valley has a long and varied history. It was first explored by Spanish explorers in the 16th century, and was later colonized by Anglo-Americans in the 19th century. The valley has been a major agricultural region since the late 19th century, and it is now one of the most heavily populated regions of the Western United States.

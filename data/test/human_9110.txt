The Neuville is a historic apartment building located at 232 E. Walton Place in the Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The eleven-story building was built in 1920, making it one of the first luxury apartment buildings in Streeterville. Architect John Reed Fugard of Fugard & Knapp, a firm which went on to design many of Streeterville's apartments, designed the Renaissance Revival building. As was typical of high-rises of the era, the lower two and upper two floors are the most ornate, with limestone facing on the lower two and projecting piers on the upper two; in contrast, the central floors are faced with plain red brick. An elaborate cornice runs along the roof on the front facade, while a plainer cornice above the second floor and a belt course above the ninth separate the building's sections. Like most luxury apartment buildings of the period, the building features a heavily ornamented entrance, a large lobby, and spacious ten-room apartments. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 2, 2013.

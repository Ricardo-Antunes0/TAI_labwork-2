Etna is a fictional character who appears as a boss in the Disgaea series of video games. She is voiced by Yuka Iguchi in the Japanese version of the games and by Rob Paulsen in the English versions.  Etna is a demoness and the ruler of the volcano Etna. She is also the mother of Laharl, Flonne, and Etna. Etna is first seen as an antagonist in Disgaea 2, where she forces Laharl to fight for her in a tournament to find a new demon lord. The player can choose to side with Laharl or Etna, and depending on their choice, Etna will reward them with different items. In Disgaea 3, Etna attempts to take over the Netherworld after being betrayed by her son, Flonne. The player can help Etna defeat her enemies and restore her honor. In Disgaea 4, Etna has been imprisoned in a pocket dimension and must be freed by Laharl before she can bring about the end of the world.  Etna is one of the most popular characters in the Disgaea series, and has been compared to iconic villains such as Darth Vader and Darth Sidious from the Star Wars series. Her appearance has been altered over the course of the games, with her appearance in Disgaea 2 being radically different from her appearance in later games. Fans have also created fan art depicting Etna as various characters from other anime and video games.

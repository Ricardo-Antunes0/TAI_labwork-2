Carver Langston is a cluster of two galaxies located about 170 million light years from Earth. The galaxies are interacting and are in the process of merging.  Carver Langston is a cluster of two galaxies located about 170 million light years from Earth. The galaxies are interacting and are in the process of merging. The merger is thought to be the result of gravitational interactions between the two galaxies, as well as their mutual tidal forces. It is expected that the merger will result in an elliptical galaxy, which will be similar to the Carver Langston Cluster.

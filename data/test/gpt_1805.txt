Gethsemane Man-made Forest is a community led initiative, which was founded in 2007, to create a man-made forest in the Gethsemane area of Dublin.  The project is divided into three phases, with the first phase completed in 2009. The second phase, which was completed in 2013, consisted of the planting of over 1,000 trees. The third and final phase, which is currently underway, involves the planting of an additional 1,500 trees.  The Gethsemane Man-made Forest provides a green space for the community and acts as a natural filter for toxins and pollutants in the air. It also helps to improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

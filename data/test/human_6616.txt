Linear Amplification via Transposon Insertion (LIANTI) is a linear whole genome amplification (WGA) method. To analyze or sequence very small amount of DNA, i.e. genomic DNA from a single cell, the picograms of DNA is subject to WGA to amplify at least thousands of times into nanogram scale, before DNA analysis or sequencing can be carried out. Previous WGA methods (DOP-PCR, MDA, MALBAC) use exponential/nonlinear amplification schemes, leading to bias accumulation and error propagation. LIANTI achieved linear amplification of the whole genome for the first time, enabling more uniform and accurate amplification. Shown in the figure is a simulation to illustrate the advantages of linear amplification over exponential amplification, assuming two DNA fragments A and B with replication yields of 100% and 70% per round, respectively. First, linear amplification is more even than exponential amplification. To achieve ~10,000 fold amplification of fragment A, exponential amplification results in a ratio of 8:1, hampering the accuracy of CNV detection. In contrast, linear amplification exhibits a ratio of 1:0.7, which is much closer to unity. Second, linear amplification is superior to exponential amplification in fidelity. In exponential amplification, errors generated in early cycles of amplification will be propagated permanently, leading to SNV false-positives. In contrast, in linear amplification, the errors would appear randomly at different locations in the amplicons to be easily filtered out.

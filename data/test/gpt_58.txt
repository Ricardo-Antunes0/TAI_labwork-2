Aerobraking is a spaceflight maneuver that reduces the speed of a spacecraft by using the air pressure of the Earth's atmosphere to slow it down. Aerobraking is used only for short distances, as it requires high energy to maintain the atmospheric pressure on the spacecraft for an extended period, and can cause significant damage.  Aerobraking was first proposed in the early 20th century, and has been used extensively since the 1960s. The first successful aerobraking operation was performed by Apollo 11 in 1969, when it slowed down from its speed of over 18,000 km/h (11,000 mph) to just over 100 km/h (62 mph) in only five minutes.

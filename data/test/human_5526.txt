Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) is a cold, relatively low salinity water mass found mostly at intermediate depths in the Southern Ocean.  The AAIW is formed at the ocean surface in the Antarctic Convergence zone or more commonly called the Antarctic Polar Front zone.  This convergence zone is normally located between 50°S and 60°S, hence this is where almost all of the AAIW is formed. Properties The AAIW is unique water mass in that it is a sinking water mass with a moderately low salinity, unlike most sinking water masses which have a relatively high salinity. This salinity minimum, unique to the AAIW, can be recognized throughout the Southern Ocean at depths ranging from 700 to 1200 meters.  Typical temperature values for the AAIW are 3-7°C, and a salinity of 34.2-34.4 psu upon initial formation.  Due to vertical mixing at intermediate depths in the Southern Ocean, the salinity slowly rises as it moves northward. Typical density of AAIW water is between 1026.82 kg/m3 and 1027.43 kg/m3.  The thickness of the AAIW ranges greatly between where it forms and its most northern extent.

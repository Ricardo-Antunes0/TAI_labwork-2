The Parker Trio was a Southern Gospel music group from the 1950s composed of singer-guitarist Bill Monroe, bassist-singer-drummer Fred Parker and pianist-organist Don White.  The trio is perhaps most notable for their chart successes in the early 1960s, with hits like "Blue Ridge Mountains", "I Believe in You (God's Plan)" and "The Nearness of You". They disbanded in 1968, but reunited in 1984 and have since released several new albums.

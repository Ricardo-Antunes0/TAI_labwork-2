Koraaga was a Castle class steel-hulled trawler built in 1914 by Smith's Dock Company, South Bank, Middlesbrough. She was requisitioned as an auxiliary minesweeper operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) in October 1917 for minesweeping duties during World War I, but she was never commissioned. Koraaga returned to be operated commercially as a fishing trawler until she wrecked when she struck a reef off Bass Point whilst carrying returning to Sydney. She was refloated on the tide after having becoming stranded and drifted till she was finally lost 5 miles east of Black Head, Gerringong on 10 September 1931. Ship description and construction  The vessels were designed with a single deck with a long raised quarter deck carried to the fore side of the trawl winch and also a raised top-gallant forecastle. On the forecastle deck a windlass for working the winch was fitted, and an anchor of the stockless type housed in a long hawse pipe. An iron breakwater was also fitted to divert the sea when the vessels are being driven in heavy weather. The crew was housed under the forecastle deck, the entrance being through a lobby on the starboard side over which the forecastle deck was carried affording ample protection to the crew when entering or leaving the forecastle in heavy weather.

Gender and development is an interdisciplinary field dealing with the various aspects of gender in relation to social, economic, political, and cultural development.  Gender and development theory is a holistic approach that considers both the structural and the individual dimensions of gender. It seeks to understand how gender shapes human experiences and opportunities, and how these experiences and opportunities affect social, economic, and political development.  There are a variety of approaches to gender and development theory, with each school of thought emphasizing different aspects of the issue. Some of the most well-known theories include feminist theory, post-structuralism, critical realism, dependency theory, and human development theory.  Gender and development interventions aim to improve the lives of women and girls around the world. Some common interventions include education programs that focus on changing gender norms and increasing womenâ€™s access to education, health programs that address issues such as maternal mortality rates or child malnutrition, economic development initiatives that help women entrepreneurs start their own businesses, or violence prevention programs that focus on reducing violence against women.

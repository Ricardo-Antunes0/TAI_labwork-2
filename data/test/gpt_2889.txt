Paestum Airfield is an abandoned World War II airfield in Italy, located approximately 10 kilometers south of the city of Paestum.  The airfield was used by the United States Army Air Forces as a bomber base during the war. It was closed in 1944. Today, only a few scattered buildings remain. The site is open to the public as a historic park.

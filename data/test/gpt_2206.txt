Folkebevegelsen mot innvandring (FMI) or "People's Movement Against Immigration" is a Norwegian right-wing populist and nationalist political party.  FMI was founded in 2001, as a successor to the short-lived Norwegian Peoples Party (NPP), which had been active against immigration since its establishment in 1993. FMI's main representatives are former members of the NPP, most notably leader Siv Jensen. FMI has close ties with the European Alliance for Freedom (EAF), a pan-European far-right political party.  Since its foundation, FMI has contested only one parliamentary election, in 2003. The party received 6% of the vote and no seats in the Storting.

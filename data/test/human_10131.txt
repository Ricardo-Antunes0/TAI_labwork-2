A social deduction game is a game in which players attempt to uncover each other's hidden role or team allegiance. Commonly, these games are played with teams, with one team being considered "good" and another being "bad". During gameplay, players can use logic and deductive reasoning to try to deduce one another's roles, while other players can bluff to keep players from suspecting them. Examples of social deduction games include Mafia, in which only the mafia know who is mafia and what the mafia players' roles are; Bang!, in which only the sheriff's role is known to everyone; and Secret Hitler, in which only the fascists know who the fascists are. Other social deduction games include The Resistance, A Fake Artist Goes to New York, Coup, Deception: Murder in Hong Kong, Dracula's Feast, The Chameleon, Two Rooms and a Boom, Spyfall 2, Love Letter, Witch Hunt, Blood on the Clocktower and Crossfire.

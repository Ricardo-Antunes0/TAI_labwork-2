Groves' dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus grovesi) is a species of dwarf lemur endemic to the eastern rainforest of Madagascar. The IUCN has classified it as Critically Endangered, due to a population decline of more than 50% over the last three generations and the fact that it is only known from a single population.

The McLaughlin Mound, also called Cemetery Mound, is a Native American mound in the central part of the U.S. state of Ohio.  Located in Mound View Cemetery near the city of Mount Vernon in Knox County, it is an important archaeological site. McLaughlin measures approximately  high and  in diameter.  Located on a hill with an elevation of , it is typical of burial mounds constructed by people of the Adena culture.  Although the date of work is uncertain, it is known to have been excavated at some point in the past; those digging into the mound discovered burned bones in the course of their work.  Such a discovery is typical of Adena mounds: the Adena frequently placed bodies within wooden buildings that were ceremonially burned, after which they constructed mounds atop the site.  As a result, it is likely that a comprehensive excavation of the mound would discover features such as postholes; excavations of similar mounds located along Alum Creek to the west revealed the remains of houses and cremated bodies.

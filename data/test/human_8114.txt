SS Bretagne was an ocean liner launched on 20 July 1951 out of Saint-Nazaire; the second of two ships built for the Société Générale de Transport Maritimes (SGTM) which operated passenger lines out of Marseilles. Her sister ship Provence was launched a year earlier at Newcastle. Bretagne was constructed with three boilers and Provence with only two, making Provence less capable of increasing speed to counteract possible delays. Career with SGTM After two brief shakedown cruises, SS Bretagne began her maiden voyage at Marseilles on 14 February 1952, traveling to Genoa, Naples, Barcelona, Dakar, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, concluding in Buenos Aires. Bretagne joined Provence in liner and immigration service from Europe to South America. Fine accommodations met First class passengers, but the majority of the ship's berths were for third and fourth class passengers, the latter sleeping in large communal dormitories segregated by sex. These berths were mainly filled with poor Italian emigrants seeking a new start in South America.

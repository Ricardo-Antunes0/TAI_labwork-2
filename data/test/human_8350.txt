Anne Lotta Sw√§rd (born 16 February 1969) is a Swedish writer. She made her debut as a novelist in 2003 with Polarsommar (Arctic Summer), which earned her an August Prize nomination on the grounds that "A mighty chorus of voices portray a family in crisis. The individual cast joints piece after piece to a powerful story about how betrayal and repeated confrontations erode the strongest relationships. Surprising shifts in perspective and a language that is characterized by sharp details, gives the story important nuances and psychological depth." Work Arctic Summer received a number of awards and was translated into several languages such as German, Dutch and Polish. Her second novel Kvicksand (Quicksand) was published in 2006. It was nominated for the Vi magazine's Literature Prize, and awarded the first scholarship from the Mare Kandre Memorial Fund. Her third novel Till sista andetaget (Breathless), winner of the Bokcirklar Award for the novel of the year, was published in 2010. It is translated into sixteen languages, including English, French and Russian.

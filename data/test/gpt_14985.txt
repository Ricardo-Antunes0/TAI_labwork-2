Indo-Fijians or Indian-Fijians (also known as Fiji Indians or Fijian Indians) are people of Indo-Aryan descent who reside in Fiji. They form the largest ethnic group in Fiji, making up almost 29% of the population. Indo-Fijians are traditionally Hindu and speak Fijian Hindi and other Indo-Aryan languages.  The first Indo-Fijians arrived in Fiji in the early eighteenth century as sailors working on British ships. In 1879, indentured labourers from India arrived to work on the sugar plantations. During World War II, many Indo-Fijians served in the military or worked in the civil service. After independence in 1970, Indo-Fijians played a significant role in government and business. Today, they are widely respected for their entrepreneurial skills and cultural diversity.  Indo-Fijians are ethnically and culturally diverse. They share a common history and culture, but also have their own traditions and customs. Indo-Fijians have assimilated into the Fijian culture, but retain their own traditions and customs. The Indo-Fijian community is strong and well organized, with a number of organizations providing healthcare, education, and other services.

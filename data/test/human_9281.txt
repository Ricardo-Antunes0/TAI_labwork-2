A stress ulcer is a single or multiple mucosal defect which can become complicated by upper gastrointestinal bleeding or physiologic stress. Ordinary peptic ulcers are found commonly in the gastric antrum and the duodenum whereas stress ulcers are found commonly in fundic mucosa and can be located anywhere within the stomach and proximal duodenum. Signs and symptoms Stress ulcers, as defined by overt bleeding and hemodynamic instability, decreased hemoglobin, and/or need for transfusion, were seen in 1.5% of patients in the 2252 patients in the Canadian Critical Care Trials group study. People with stress ulcers have a longer ICU length of stay (up to 8 days) and a higher mortality (up to 4 fold) than patients who do not have stress ulceration and bleeding. While the bleeding and transfusions associated with the stress ulcerations contribute to the increased mortality, the contribution of factors like low blood pressure, sepsis, and respiratory failure to the mortality independently of the stress ulceration cannot be ignored.

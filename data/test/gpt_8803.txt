Fengbo (Chinese: 風伯), also known as Fengshi, is a deity worshipped in Chinese folk religion and Taoism. He is often depicted as a bearded old man holding an umbrella and a sheng fan, and is considered the god of wind, rainfall, thunder and lightning.  Fengbo is largely considered to be the deified form of an ancient human figure known as Fengshui Sheng (風水神), meaning "god of wind, rain and water". In general, Fengbo is seen as the guardian of people and their property, and is also responsible for guiding travelers on their path.  Fengbo is also venerated as the god of agriculture, and his presence is believed to be beneficial to crops. In some cases, Fengbo may also be worshipped as a symbol of good luck.

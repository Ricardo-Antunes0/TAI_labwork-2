Conrad Ecklie is a fictional character on the CBS drama series "The Good Wife" played by Josh Charles. He is the husband of Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) and the father of their two children, Peter (Max Thieriot) and Alicia Jr. (Alyse Eady).  Ecklie is a white-collar criminal defense lawyer who, at the beginning of the show, is disbarred after being convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud. He later re-opens his law practice and becomes a protégé of Alicia's mentor, Peter Florrick (Bob Odenkirk). Ecklie is largely responsible for Peter Florrick's successful political career as State's Attorney. He is also involved in Alicia's campaign to become U.S. Senator in 2013.  In 2016, Ecklie is accused of conspiracy to commit murder and obstruction of justice after he hires an assassin to kill his wife's stalker. The charges are later dropped, but he becomes disbarred again. In the final season, Ecklie helps Alicia win back her law license and re-opens her own law firm.

Romanian railway services is an index page with general information about railway services in Romania.  Romanian railways are operated by state-owned Company National Railway Administration (CNA). Romanian railways were originally built as metre gauge railways in the 1850s, with the first standard gauge line opening in 1884. The network was extended and modernised in the following decades, with a number of new lines being built. In the early 1990s, Romania began to convert its railways to standard gauge, with an extensive programme of upgrading completed by 2007. As of 2015, the Romanian railway network consists of 1,826 km of standard gauge track and 453 km of narrow gauge track.  Romanian railway services are divided into three broad categories: domestic services, which cover trains travelling within Romania; international services, which cover trains travelling to or from countries outside of Romania; and freight services, which cover trains transporting goods between Romanian cities and ports. There are also a number of specialised railways, including the Căile Ferate Române (Romanian Railways), which operates long-distance passenger services; the Căile Ferate Române de Nord (Romanian Railways), which operates long-distance freight services between the Baltic states and Romania; and the CFR Marfa (Railway Transport Corporation), which operates freight trains primarily between Romania and Hungary.

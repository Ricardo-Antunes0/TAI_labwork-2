The mountain is located in the north-west of the park, between the valleys of Cwm Idwal and Cwm Pencerdd.  The summit of Coity Mountain is 903 m above sea level, making it the highest point in the Brecon Beacons National Park. The mountain is part of a long ridge of mountains that runs north-south through the park. The ridge rises gradually from its base to the summit, with several smaller peaks and ridges along the way.  Coity Mountain is part of a long chain of mountains that run through south Wales. The mountains are made up of Precambrian and Cambrian rocks, with areas of slate and limestone. The landscape around Coity Mountain is characterised by steep-sided valleys, wooded hills, and rugged peaks.  The mountain was first recorded in 1576 by Sir Hugh Owen and named after an estate called Coity in Glamorgan. The estate was owned by Sir Richard Grenville and was used as a hunting lodge. The remains of the estate can still be seen on the slopes of Coity Mountain.   Coity Mountain has been used for hiking, climbing, and skiing since the early 1900s. The mountain is popular with walkers, climbers, and skiers because it offers a variety of trails for different levels of difficulty. There are trails for beginners

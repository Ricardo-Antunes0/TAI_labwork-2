Fructilactobacillus fructivorans is a gram-positive bacteria and a member of the genus Fructilactobacillus in the family Lactobacillaceae. It is found in wine, beer, grape must, dairy, sauerkraut, meat, and fish. They are facultative anaerobics and experience best growth in environments with 5-10% CO2. Temperature for growth is between 2 °C and 53 °C, with the optimum temperature between 30 °C and 40 °C and a pH level between 5.5 and 6.2. The bacterium is rod shaped and can be found in the following forms: single, pairs, chains of varying lengths, or long curved filaments. Lactobacillus fructivorans is non-motile. The main end product of the metabolic process is lactate, although ethanol, acetate, formate, CO2, and succinate may also be produced. Food production  The bacteria have several metabolic properties that allow them to function as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy, meat, and vegetable products and beverages. F. fructivorans is mainly produces lactic acid. Once the microbe metabolizes sugars into lactic acids, the foods and beverages develop the sour taste that is characteristic of fermented foods and beverages.

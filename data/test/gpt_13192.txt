Carl Maria 'Roland' Geldner (23 May 1870 – 2 February 1938) was a German classical philologist who specialized in Homer.  Geldner was born in Berlin, where he received his early education from his father. He then studied at the universities of Berlin, Munich and Heidelberg, earning his doctorate at Heidelberg in 1893. From 1893 to 1902 he was an assistant professor at the University of Berlin, and from 1902 to 1905 a professor at the University of Munich. In 1905 he became a full professor at the University of Königsberg, where he remained until his retirement in 1932.  Geldner's major works include Die Ilias (1903), Die Odyssee (1904), and Die Iliad (1914). In 1908 he published a commentary on Homer's Iliad that is still considered the standard work on the text.

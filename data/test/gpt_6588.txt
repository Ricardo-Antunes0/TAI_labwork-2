Troost Avenue is one of the major streets in the city of Newark, New Jersey. The road runs from the Passaic River in the east to Raymond Boulevard in the west and from Clinton Street in the north to Central Avenue in the south.  Troost Avenue was named after Johannes de Troost, a Dutchman who settled in Newark in the early 17th century. The avenue was initially known as Elm Street, but was renamed Troost Avenue in 1824 in honor of De Troost's distinguished service to the United States during the War of 1812. The avenue is home to a number of important buildings, including the Newark Public Library, First Presbyterian Church of Newark, and Saint James Episcopal Church.

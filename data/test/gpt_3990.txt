Appraisal theory is the theory in psychology that suggests that people appraise the worth of objects and events by estimating the value of the benefits and risks they bring. It is a branch of cognitive psychology.  Appraisal theory has been used to explain a variety of phenomena, including judgments about personal qualities, financial decisions, and choices between different courses of action. It has also been used to explain how people respond to changes in their surroundings.  The theory has been criticized for its lack of precision and for its inability to account for individual differences. However, the theory has been found to be a useful tool for understanding a wide range of judgments and decisions.

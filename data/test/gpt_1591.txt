Montague Dawson RSMA, FRSA (1895â€“1973) was a British architect and designer who worked in the Modernist style. He was a leading figure in the development of the British school of architecture, and his work has been influential in both Britain and internationally.  Dawson was born on 8 October 1895 in Romford, Essex, England to Henry Dawson and his wife, Gertrude. He studied at the Architectural Association School of Architecture from 1919 to 1922, after which he worked for several years as an assistant to the architectural firm of Owen Williams. In 1928, he established his own practice, Dawson & Partners.  Dawson's work is characterised by its use of straight lines, uncluttered surfaces and a minimalist approach to design. His buildings are often notable for their use of natural materials such as wood and stone, as well as their simplicity. His work has been praised for its elegance and contemporaryity, and he has been described as one of the most important architects of the 20th century.  Dawson died on 7 January 1973 in London.

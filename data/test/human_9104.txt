Burigon (died 1820), also called Burragong or Jack, was an Awabakal  man and "Chief of the Newcastle Tribe".  Alongside his tribe, Burigon entertained Governor Macquarie with a corroboree at the site of the Newcastle Government House.  Under the patronage of Commandant James Wallis, who was in charge of the British colonial post of Newcastle from 1816 to 1818, the convict artist Joseph Lycett painted at least 14 scenes of traditional practices of the Awabakal people. Burigon and James Wallis hunted together and Wallis was to later write that he had "kinder feelings" for Burigon than for many of his own heritage. This close relationship of Burigon and Wallis was instrumental in gaining access for the artist Joseph Lycett to visually document the life of the Awabakal people.  Chief Burigon died October 27, 1820; he was fatally wounded at Newcastle when attempting to apprehend an escaped convict. References

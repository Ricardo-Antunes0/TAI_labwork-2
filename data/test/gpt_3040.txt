The history of electrovibration goes back to the early days of electricity when scientists were investigating the potential uses for this new form of energy. Electrovibration was first used to create sound in 1880 by French scientist, Charles-Ã‰mile Guillaume. He used a device called an electrovibrometer to create vibrations that could be heard.   Electrovibration has since been used in many different ways, most notably in the fields of engineering and music. Electrovibration is now used to create sound, motion, and heat. It is also being studied as a potential way to power vehicles and other devices.

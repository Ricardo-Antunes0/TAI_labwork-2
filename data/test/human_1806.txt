Myton School is a coeducational secondary school and sixth form. Most students live locally, although the school attracts students from outside the priority area. The school is located on Myton Road in the town of Warwick in Warwickshire, England. The history of the school in its current form dates from 1968.   the school has around 1,700 students. History The school started life as Warwick School, a mixed-sex, non-selective secondary school which was opened in 1954.  In 1959 Oken became Oken High School for Boys when the girls were transferred to the newly established Beauchamp High School for Girls.  The two single-sex schools had each moved to the site that Myton School presently occupies and they were amalgamated in 1968. Since then the school has grown substantially as the size of each school year has increased, 11-year-olds were admitted for the first time in 1996 (when Warwickshire changed its secondary school start date to a year earlier) and as the Sixth Form has grown in size. The school became a grant maintained school in 1992, and a foundation school after grant maintained status was abolished by the incoming Labour government in 1997. Under the government's school specialisation funding scheme it has become a specialist Science College. On 1 July 2011, the school became an academy.

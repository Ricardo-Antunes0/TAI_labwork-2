RNA thermometers (RNATs) regulate gene expression in response to environmental changes by sensing the temperature of RNA  .  RNA thermometers are devices that measure the temperature of RNA. This is done by measuring the amount of heat that is needed to convert the RNA from a liquid to a solid. This allows researchers to gauge how much gene expression has changed in response to environmental changes. RNA thermometers have been found to be useful for regulating gene expression in response to environmental changes, such as changing temperatures.

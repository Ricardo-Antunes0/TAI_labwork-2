About her life, Sham says: "I do not fear loss and always try to be myself. I like to seize the moment and don’t dwell on the past, but rather look forward to the future. I care deeply about people and the environment around me. I love to travel because it allows me to praise the magic of nature and help’s me to grow through meeting different people from diverse cultures. Some people say that girls from the 1990s need to be more mature and stable, but I am a strong and passionate person with bigger dreams! I think that it is important to be satisfied with oneself. Even though some dreams may be hard to achieve, I will never stop working to improve the future and hope that I can help this world."

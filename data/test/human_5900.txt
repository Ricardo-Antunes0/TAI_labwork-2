Michael Synkellos , also spelled Syncellus (c. 760 – 4 January 846), was a Greek Orthodox Arab Christian priest, monk and saint. He held the administrative office of synkellos of the patriarchate of Jerusalem (c. 811–815) and the patriarchate of Constantinople (843–846). He was involved in disputes over the filioque clause and over Byzantine iconoclasm, which landed him in prison for the period 815–843. He nevertheless wrote extensively, producing grammar, theology, hagiographies, hymns and poetry. He wrote in Greek and made at least one translation from Arabic. Life Michael was born in Jerusalem in or about 761. He was of Arab origin. He was the only son of his parents and had several older sisters. His mother dedicated him at the age of three to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where he was given the rank of anagnostes (reader). Around 786, when he was twenty-five, his father died, his mother and sisters entered a convent and he entered the lavra of Mar Saba as a monk. In 797 or 798, he was ordained a priest by the patriarch of Jerusalem. After two years in Jerusalem, he returned to Mar Saba. In 800, he accepted the brothers Theodore and Theophanes as his monastic disciples.

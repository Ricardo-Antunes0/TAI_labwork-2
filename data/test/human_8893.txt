The Red Scorpions is a gang based in British Columbia, Canada. It was originally formed in 2005 by Quang Vinh Thang Le (known as Michael Le), Konaam Shirzad, Matthew Johnston, and two other un-named young offenders. Michael Le testified at the Surrey Six trial that he and Shirzad initially formed the Red Scorpions after meeting in a youth detention centre facility. Le said the name Scorpions was a tribute to his "older brother who was killed and his nickname used to be Scorpion". The gang "used the word Red to symbolize blood" he said. Le said Jamie Bacon and his brothers were not founders but joined the gang a few years later. Red Scorpions have been running "dial-a-dope lines" – (drug trafficking operations) in the suburbs of Vancouver since 2000. Gang members can be identified by "RS" tattoos on their arms and necks; any forms of skull tattoos on the right arm indicate how many people that member has murdered. The Red Scorpions come from various cultural and linguistic backgrounds, as they consider race secondary to loyalty and respect.

Engineered bamboo is a set of composite materials, typically a wood fiber reinforced plastic, created from the interlocking of bamboo strips.   The composite materials are used in a variety of applications including construction, furniture, toys, bicycles and aircraft. The technology was first developed in the early 1990s by scientists at the University of Connecticut.

Peter Bielkowicz (1 February 1902 – 30 September 1972) was a Polish-born Swiss artist and sculptor who had a significant impact on Minimalist sculpture in the 1950s and 1960s.  Born in Warsaw, then part of the Russian Empire, Bielkowicz studied at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts under Bronisław Władysław Witkiewicz. He emigrated to Switzerland in 1923 and settled in Lausanne. There he met fellow artists such as Jean Dubuffet, Hans Arp and Yves Klein, who would have a significant influence on his work.  Bielkowicz's early sculptures were geometric constructions made from metal or plastic, and were based on the principles of gestural abstraction. He developed a simpler and more streamlined style in the 1950s, influenced by the work of Piet Mondrian and Maillol. His sculptures often depicted simple abstract forms or figures with minimalistic detailing.  Bielkowicz was awarded the Prix de Rome in 1950 and became a Swiss citizen in 1957. He died in Lausanne aged 76.

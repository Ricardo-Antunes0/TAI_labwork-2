A technical support scam, or tech support fraud, is a type of fraud in which individuals contact customer service representatives to resolve technical issues, but instead flee with the victim's money.  The scam typically begins with an unsolicited email or call from someone claiming to be from technical support, asking for assistance with a problem. The scammer may suggest that the user disable security features on their computer in order to resolve the issue, and may even provide a fake fix. If the user allows the scammer to disable security features, they may be able to access personal information or financial data on the computer.  Many times, the scammers will ask for money in order to fix the computer. They may offer to sell the user a subscription to a service or offer them a discount on products. In some cases, the scammers will charge for services that were not requested or provided.  Tech support scams are often perpetrated by individuals who are familiar with users' personal information and have access to their computers. They use this knowledge to exploit users and steal their money. Scammers often use fake emails and identities in order to appear legitimate, which can make it difficult for victims to identify and contact authorities about the scam.

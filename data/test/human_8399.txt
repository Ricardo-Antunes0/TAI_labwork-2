Carbonate hardness, is a measure of the water hardness caused by the presence of carbonate  and bicarbonate  anions. Carbonate hardness is usually expressed either in degrees KH (dKH) (from the German "Karbonathärte"), or in parts per million calcium carbonate ( ppm  or grams  per litre|mg/l).  One dKH is equal to 17.848 mg/l (ppm) , e.g. one dKH corresponds to the carbonate and bicarbonate ions found in a solution of approximately 17.848 milligrams of calcium carbonate per litre of water (17.848 ppm). Both measurements (mg/l or KH) are usually expressed as mg/l  – meaning the concentration of carbonate expressed as if calcium carbonate were the sole source of carbonate ions. An aqueous solution containing 120 mg NaHCO3 (baking soda) per litre of water will contain 1.4285 mmol/l of bicarbonate, since the molar mass of baking soda is 84.007 g/mol. This is equivalent in carbonate hardness to a solution containing 0.71423 mmol/L of (calcium) carbonate, or 71.485 mg/l of calcium carbonate (molar mass 100.09 g/mol). Since one degree KH = 17.848 mg/L CaCO3, this solution has a KH of 4.0052 degrees.

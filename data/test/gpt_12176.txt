Ta'anit or Taanis  is a volume of the Mishnah. The text is the legal commentary of the rabbis of the Second Temple period, dealing with civil, criminal and religious law.  Ta'anit contains the responsa of the Tannaim (Rabbis from the 1st to 4th centuries CE) on a variety of legal and religious topics, including Biblical law, Halakha (Jewish law), Teshuva (repentance), and Mitzvot (commandments). It is sometimes called the "Talmud of the Land" because much of its content pertains to agricultural law.  The Ta'anit is divided into six sections:   The first section, Megillah (chapter) 1-11, covers civil law.   Section 2, Megillah (chapter) 12-26, covers criminal law.   Section 3, Megillah (chapter) 27-50, covers religious law.   Section 4, Megillah (chapter) 51-72, covers agricultural law.   Section 5, Megillah (chapter) 73-106, covers legal cases.   Section 6, Megillah (chapter) 107-126, covers responsa.

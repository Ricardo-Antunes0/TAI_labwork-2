Gilles Mureau (also Mureue, as he spelled it himself) (c. 1450 – July 1512) was a French composer and singer of the Renaissance. He was active in central France, mainly Chartres, and was one of the composers listed by Eloy d'Amerval in his long 1508 poem Le livre de la deablerie as one of the great composers of the age, resident in Paradise – even though he was still alive. While he probably wrote a substantial number of works, only four secular compositions survive. Life  Nothing is known about his origin, but he first appears in the cathedral of Chartres as a boy singer in 1462. He became choirmaster of the boys in the Chartres choir school in 1469, which makes a birthdate of 1450 a fair approximation. In 1472 he became a canon. Between March and November 1483 he made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, being replaced in his duties at Chartres by the young Antoine Brumel (this is the earliest mention of this renowned composer). The following year Mureau made another pilgrimage, this one to Santiago de Compostela.

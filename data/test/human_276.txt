Fahim Saleh (December 12, 1986 â€“  July 13, 2020) was a Bangladeshi-American entrepreneur and computer programmer who founded Gokada in Nigeria, Pathao and JoBike. Saleh was also a founding partner of Adventure Capital, a Manhattan-based venture capital firm. Biography Saleh was born in Saudi Arabia, to Bangladeshi parents who frequently relocated for work, before settling in Rochester, New York. He taught himself to program at a young age, and created a variety of online projects such as a website for his family, a teenage social platform and a prank dial service, PrankDial,  after his graduation from Bentley University. When he had grown older, Saleh said that he wanted to create something that "adds legitimate value to humanity". He created his first company while still in high school. He used income from PrankDial to fund his further ventures. PrankDial was somewhat controversial because it was abused as a tool for harassment.

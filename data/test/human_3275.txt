Long Meiyi  is a woman from Guizhou province in China who alleged she was raped by mining magnate Zhou Shili. Long's allegations made domestic and international headlines after she and her parents began appealing to Beijing for justice and complaining of corruption in the courts. A significant factor in the case's popularity is that Long's mother and stepfather are government officials in China, who have generally found themselves on the other side of the politicised legal system that she now claims is obstructing the justice she seeks. Long's case caused a sensation in the Chinese blogosphere as it was revealed that her stepfather, Tian Wancang, was responsible for Liupanshui's "stability preservation" efforts, which means that in addition to police and other security groups, he ran the letters and complaints system that is supposed to provide an avenue for disgruntled citizens while simultaneously focusing on gathering intelligence about those citizens.

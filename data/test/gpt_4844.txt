Caltha introloba, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a small perennial plant in the Ranunculaceae family. It grows in high altitude areas of Europe, Asia and North America.  The alpine buttercup blooms from July to September and produces small, white or pink flowers. The flowers are pollinated by bees, butterflies and other insects. The alpine buttercup is an important source of nectar for wild bees and other insects.  The alpine buttercup is used as an ornamental plant in gardens and natural areas. It is also used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, such as the large blue butterfly (Lysandra bellargus).

Submissions Only is a comedy web series presented by comedian and writer, Hannah Gadsby. The show is a mockumentary-style comedy series about an unassuming office worker named Jane who is mistakenly put in charge of the submissions department of a prestigious TV channel.  The series stars Gadsby as Jane, with a supporting cast including Aunty Donna, her eccentric and opinionated boss; Tim, the crusty head of programming; and Dave, Jane's naive young co-worker. The series is produced by Gadsby and her long-time collaborator, director Wayne Blair.  The show has been praised by critics for its unique humor and darkly comic take on the mundanity of office life. It has been compared to shows like Office Space and 30 Rock, and has been described as "a brilliantly subversive take on the workplace" by The Guardian.  Submissions Only is set to premiere on Netflix in 2019.

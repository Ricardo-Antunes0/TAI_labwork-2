Wade Bruce Cook (October 9, 1949 â€“ July 28, 2021) was an American author and self-proclaimed financial guru.  Cook claimed to have started his success when he was a taxi driver in the 1970s.  His first book, Real Estate Money Machine, was originally self-published in 1981. He filed for personal bankruptcy in 1987. An updated version of his book was published in 1996. His company was liquidated in 2003 after it had been forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy by creditors, and he served 88 months in prison for tax evasion. He offered trading advice through his website and publications for a period after his release from prison. Background In the 1990s, Cook was aggressive in his use of paid radio programs which he used to market investment seminars.  He claimed he could teach people to double some of their money every 2.5 to 4 months.  Obviously this claim was controversial, and there was eventually an agreement with the government to drop that claim.

Operation Sayeed (Arabic: عملية الصياد) also known as Operation Hunter in English, was a series of operations conducted in western Al Anbar Governorate by the United States Marine Corps in 2005. It was an umbrella operation, consisting of at least 11 named operations between July 2005 to December 2005. The purpose was to drive Al-Qaeda in Iraq forces from the Western Euphrates River Valley. Some parts of Operation Sayeed were Operation Steel Curtain and Operation Iron Fist. There were three goals of Operation Sayeed, in addition to removing AQI from the Western Euphrates River Valley; they were to ensure there was a secure "climate" and "environment" to conduct a referendum in October and national elections in December 2005; and the third was to secure the control of the Iraqi border to the Iraqi people. Al-Anbar Governorate was divided into areas of operations: II Marine Expeditionary Force (codenamed Operation Atlanta) included Area of Operations Denver (western region), Area of Operations Topeka (Ramadi and surrounding area), Area of Operations Raleigh (Fallujah and surrounding area) and Area of Operations Oshkosh (al-Taqaddum).

The Volkswagen Auto 2000 is a concept car first shown by German car company Volkswagen in 1981. It was part of a German government-sponsored program to develop cars for the year 2000. Volkswagen's prototype was joined by efforts from Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and the University Working Group HAG (Hochschularbeitsgemeinschaft). As with the other Auto 2000 concepts, Volkswagen's car focused on fuel economy through the use of efficient engines and streamlining, and many of its features were to end up in series production.

They put forth 110Â million Deutsche Mark for a program to develop the "car for the year 2000," with strict limitations on fuel consumption and weight. The four resulting projects were all presented at the 1981 Frankfurt Auto Show. BMW and Porsche were also initially part of the Auto 2000 project, but they did not reach the second stage (concept car).

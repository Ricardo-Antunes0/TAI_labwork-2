HD 91312 is a multiple star system in the northern circumpolar constellation Ursa Major. Faintly visible to the naked eye, it is the brightest star of Ursa Major without Flamsteed designation with a combined apparent visual magnitude of 4.72. The system is located at a distance of 109 light-years from the Sun based on parallax. The radial velocity is poorly constrained, but it appears to be drifting further away at a rate of ~9 km/s. This was identified as a visual binary by John Herschel in 1831. The pair have an angular separation of , equivalent to a linear projected separation of . Variations in the radial velocity as well as direct imaging, indicate the presence of a low-mass stellar companion. This companion is an early-to-mid red dwarf, and orbits the primary on an edge-on orbit with a semi-major axis of 9.7 au. This is a young system with an age of around 200 million years. It display an infrared excess from a circumstellar disk of dusty debris. It has a mean temperature of  and is orbiting  from the inner pair.

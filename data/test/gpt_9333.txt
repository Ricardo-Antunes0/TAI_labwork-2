The A2 highway is a road in Botswana that connects the eastern and western regions of the country. The highway starts at the town of Palapye, in the east, and ends at the town of Kasane, in the west. The total length of the highway is 488 kilometres.  The A2 highway was built in the early 1990s as part of efforts by the Botswana government to improve transportation links between the eastern and western regions of the country. At that time, there were few roads linking these two regions, and transportation was mainly done by truck. The A2 highway has made it easier for people to travel between these two regions, and it has also helped to boost economic growth in eastern Botswana.  The A2 highway is a major tourist destination in Botswana. Tourists who visit the highway often enjoy viewing game parks and other natural attractions along the way. The highway also has several rest stops that are popular with travelers.

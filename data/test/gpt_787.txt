Dismal Lakes are a series of three large, shallow lakes located in the Canadian province of Manitoba. The lakes are located in southeastern Manitoba, near the town of Dryden. The lakes are fed by the Dismal River and are part of the Nelson River watershed.  The first Dismal Lake was created in 1871 when a major flood destroyed the town of Dryden. The second lake was created in 1899 when a dam was built on the Dismal River. The third lake was created in 1978 when a dam was built on the Nelson River.  The three lakes are popular for fishing, boating, and swimming. The lakes are also used for water sports such as water skiing and jet skiing.

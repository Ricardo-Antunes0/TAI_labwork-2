Wellington's Column, or the Waterloo Memorial, is a monument commemorating the Battle of Waterloo, which took place on 18 June 1815. It was erected in 1853 by the Duke of Wellington's immortal son, the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, on the site of the battlefield at Waterloo in Belgium. The monument is 66 metres (216 ft) high, and is made from a solid granite block weighing over 100 tonnes.   The column is surmounted by a statue of Wellington, and was built to commemorate the victory at Waterloo which halted Napoleon's ambitions to conquer Europe. The memorial is a popular tourist attraction, and is one of the most photographed spots in Belgium.

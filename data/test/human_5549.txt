Heidi Marie Schellman (born 1957) is an American particle physicist at Oregon State University (OSU), where she heads the Department of Physics. She is an expert in Quantum chromodynamics. Early life and education Schellman was born in 1957 in Hennepin, Minnesota, the daughter of two chemists. Her father, John Anthony Schellman, who trained at Princeton, was a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Oregon; he was an early member of the "groundbreaking Institute of Molecular Biology" and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Her mother, F. Charlotte Green, held a Ph.D. in chemistry from Stanford and had also worked at the California Institute of Technology. They married in 1954 while they were both postdoctoral fellows at the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen, Denmark. At the University of Oregon, both her parents "were known for advancing the study of protein structure, folding and stability through techniques such as circular dichroism spectroscopy".

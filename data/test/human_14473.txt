Hillcrest Grammar School in Cale Green, Stockport, Greater Manchester was an independent day school with around 200 pupils aged 3 to 16. The school was founded as a boys' preparatory school in 1940 on Hillcrest Road in Bramhall. It became co-educational in the 1950s and also started to take pupils up to age 16 and added Grammar to its title.  The school moved in 1983 to the former "Stockport High School for Girls" building built in 1910 in the Cale Green district of Stockport, close to Davenport railway station. The old part of the building is locally listed. A sports hall with four badminton courts was built in 1994 and a new pre-preparatory department in 2003. A new Preparatory Building with facilities for the Nursery was opened by Olympic Swimmer Michael Rock in October 2009. The school closed in July 2014 due to financial issues that began in 2007. Hillcrest was accredited by the Independent Schools Council. The school was owned and operated by a registered charity "Hillcrest Grammar School (Bramhall Educational Trust Limited)", which is also a limited company.

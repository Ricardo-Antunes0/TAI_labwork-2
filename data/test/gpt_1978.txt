Social seating is a type of social seating where people are seated in groups, typically around a table. It is often used in restaurants, pubs, and other public venues. It can be contrasted with individual seating, where each person sits alone at a table.   One reason social seating is popular is that it allows people to meet new friends. In restaurants, for example, it is common for customers to sit together and chat while they eat their food. This can be a great way to catch up on news or to make new friends.   Another advantage of social seating is that it can be more comfortable than sitting alone. In particular, social seating can provide good support for people who are sitting down for an extended period of time. This is because people are able to lean on each other if they need to rest their arms or legs.

In J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy writings, Isengard is a stronghold in the northern reaches of Middle-earth. The fortress lies on a steep-sided hill, the only ascent to which is guarded by a great iron gate. Isengard was the home of the wizard Saruman, and it was from here that he directed his evil schemes against the people of Middle-earth.

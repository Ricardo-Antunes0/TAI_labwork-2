A nanoradio (also called carbon nanotube radio) is a nanotechnology acting as a radio transmitter and receiver by using carbon nanotubes. One of the first nanoradios was constructed in 2007 by researchers under Alex Zettl at the University of California, Berkeley where they successfully transmitted an audio signal. Due to the small size, nanoradios can have several possible applications such as radio function in the bloodstream. History  The first observation of a nanoradio can be accredited to a Japanese physicist Sumio Iijima in 1991 who saw a "a luminous discharge of electricity" coming from a carbon nanotube on a graphite electrode. On October 31, 2007, a team of researchers under Alex Zettl at the University of California, Berkeley created one of the first nanoradios. Their experiment consisted of placing a multilayered nanotube placed on a silicon electrode and connecting it to a counter electrode through a wire and a DC battery. Both the electrode and nanotube were also put in a vacuum of about 10âˆ’7 Torr. They then placed the apparatus into a high-resolution transmission electron microscope to document the movement of the nanotube. They observed the nanoradio vibrating and transmitted a song called "Layla" by Eric Clapton. After some minor adjustments, the team was able to transmit and receive signals from a couple meters across the laboratory; however, the initial audio receptions from the radio were scratchy which Zettl believed was due to the lack of a better vacuum.

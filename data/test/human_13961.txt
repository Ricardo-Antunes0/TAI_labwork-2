Satara  (ISO: Sātārā) is a city located in the Satara District of Maharashtra state of India, near the confluence of the river Krishna and its tributary, the Venna. The city was established in the 16th century and was the seat of the Chhatrapati of Maratha Empire, Shahu I. It is the headquarters of Satara Tehsil, as well as the Satara District. The city gets its name from the seven forts (Sat-Tara) which are around the city. The city is known as a Soldier's city as well as Pensioner's city. History The first Muslim invasion of the Deccan took place in 1296. In 1636, the Nizam Shahi dynasty came to an end. In 1663, Chattrapati Shivaji conquered Parali and Satara fort. After the death of Shivaji, Shahu Shivaji, heir apparent to the Maratha Empire, captured by Mughals when he was only seven years old, remained their prisoner till the death of his father in 1700. The Dowager Maharani Tarabai proclaimed his younger half-brother, and her son, Shahu Sambhaji as Chhatrapati Maharaj under her regency. Mughals released Shahu under certain preconditions in 1707, so that Marathas would face an internal war for the throne. Shahu returned to the Maratha Empire and claimed his inheritance. Aurangzeb's son Muhammad Azam Shah conquered Satara fort Ajinkyatara after a 6-month siege, later won by Parshuram Pratinidhi in 1706. In 1708, Chattrapati Shahu, the son of Chattrapati Sambhaji, was crowned at the Satara fort. The direct descendants of Chattrapati Shivaji continue to live in Satara. Chattrapati Udayanraje Bhonsle is the 13th descendant of Shivaji.

Viventius (fl. 364 - 371) was a Roman general who fought in the civil war of the late Roman Republic. Viventius was killed in battle against the Visigoths in 371.   Viventius was born in the late 3rd century AD, and entered military service in the early years of the Roman Republic. He distinguished himself during the Second Punic War, and by 281 had been promoted to the rank of tribune. In the subsequent civil war, he served as a general under Aemilius Lepidus. In 364, he was elected Consul for the first time, and served until his death in 371.  Viventius is most famous for his participation in the Battle of Aquae Sextiae, where he decisively defeated a numerically superior Visigothic force. The victory led to a gradual erosion of Visigothic power in Italy, and ultimately their defeat in 410 at the Battle of Vesuvius.

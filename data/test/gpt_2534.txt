Graham Allen (born 23 December 1963) is a British writer. He is best known for his comic novels for young adults, often set in the fictional town of Wimpole Street.  Allen was born in 1963, in London. He began writing in his early teens, and sold his first story to a school magazine at the age of sixteen. After graduating from the University of East Anglia with a degree in English, Allen worked as a teacher before becoming a full-time writer in 1998.  Allen's first novel, "Wimpole Street", was published in 2002. It tells the story of Jimmy Patterson, a teenager who moves to Wimpole Street – a fictional town based on London's Bloomsbury district – and becomes involved in the conflicts between the residents. The book was followed by two sequels, "The Wimpole Tales" (2005) and "The Wings of the Dove" (2007). Both were highly successful and received wide critical acclaim. Allen has since written three more novels in the series, "The Boy Who Fell from the Sky" (2010), "The Outcast" (2012), and "The Return of the Dove" (2015).  Allen's other books include "The Ghosts of Wimpole Street" (2006), a non-fiction book about London's Bloomsbury district; "A Map of Mischief" (2009), an adventure novel for young adults; and "The Grownups" (2011), a novel about life after high school.

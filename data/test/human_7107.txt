Peter Brimelow (born 13 October 1947) is a British-born American columnist, writer, and magazine editor. He is the founder of the website VDARE, an anti-immigration site associated with white supremacy, white nationalism, and the alt-right. He believes that "whites built American culture" and that "it is at risk from non-whites who would seek to change it". Brimelow was previously a writer and editor at National Review, and columnist for Dow Jones' MarketWatch. Brimelow founded the Center for American Unity in 1999 and served as its first president. He describes himself as a paleoconservative. Brimelow has also been described as a leader within the alt-right movement. He rejects the labels of "white supremacist" and "white nationalist" and prefers to be known as a "civic nationalist".  In January 2021, a judge dismissed a lawsuit Brimelow brought against The New York Times, ruling that his being called a "white nationalist" was not defamatory.

The castle of Ziwiyeh or Ziwiyeh Castle is a ruined Crusader-era castle located in the Israeli-occupied West Bank town of Ziwiyeh.  The castle was built by the Crusaders in the early 12th century, and was used as a military stronghold by the Kingdom of Jerusalem. After being captured by the Ayyubids in 1187, it was subsequently used by the Mamluks. In 1265, it was captured by the Mongols, and remained in their hands until 1291. In 1347, it was captured by the Ayyubids again. The castle was abandoned in the early 15th century, and has since been destroyed by natural forces or vandalism.  Ziwiyeh Castle is located near the villages of al-Mughayyir, Kafr Qaddum, and Burin. It is accessible from Route 606, which connects Jerusalem to Jericho.

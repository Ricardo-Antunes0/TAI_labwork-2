(OSE: 7983) is a Japanese firearms manufacturer located in Nankoku, K≈çchi Prefecture. Their products include shotguns produced for Browning Arms Company and rifles licensed by Winchester Firearms. In European markets, these products are sold under both the Miroku and Browning brand names. Charles Daly Firearms of the United States imported Miroku over/under shotguns throughout the 1960s to early 1970s. Afterwards, Miroku found a new outlet for the over/under models under Browning, explaining the similarities from late models imported by Daly to early Browning Citori Type 1 models. This also coincides with FN and Miroku's joint buyout of Brownings stock in 1977. Miroku manufactured a few different models of handguns between the 1962 to 1968, though these were not widely distributed. Among the most common is the "Liberty Chief" model, .38 caliber revolver. They briefly manufactured copies of the Browning BL22, a .22 lever-action rifle, under the name of Miroku ML22. This model was popular with Australian rabbit hunters due to its low price and a high magazine capacity of 15 rounds.

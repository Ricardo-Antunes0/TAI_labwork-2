The Klimov RD-500 was an unlicensed Soviet turbofan engine designed by Dmitri Klimov. It was first flown on the Sukhoi Su-27 in 1987.  The RD-500 was a twin-shaft, axial-flow turbojet engine with a single-stage fan, producing 497 kN (111,000 lbf) of thrust. It had a very low fan speed ratio, and suffered from poor fuel efficiency and high noise levels. The engine was replaced by the more successful Klimov RD-600 in the late 1990s.

Verbal overshadowing is a phenomenon where giving a verbal description of a face (or other complex stimuli) impairs recognition of that face or other stimuli. This was first reported by Schooler and Englster-Schooler (1990) where it was shown that the effects can be observed across multiple domains of cognition which are known to rely on non-verbal knowledge and perceptual expertise. One example of this is memory, which has been known to be influenced by language. Seminal work by Carmichael and collaborators (1932) demonstrated that when verbal labels are connected to non-verbal forms during an  individual's encoding process it could potentially bias the way those forms are reproduced in the future. Because of this, memory performance relying on reportable aspects of memory that encode visual forms, should be vulnerable to the effects of verbalization. Initial findings Schooler and Englster-Schooler (1990) were the first to report findings of verbal overshadowing. In their study, participants watched a video of a simulated robbery and were instructed to either verbally describe the robber or engage in a control task. Those who engaged in giving a verbal description were less likely to correctly identify the robber from a test lineup, compared to those who engaged in the control task. A larger effect was detected when the verbal description was provided 20, rather than 5, minutes after the video, and immediately before the test lineup. A meta-analysis by Meissner and Brigham (2008) supported the effects of verbal overshadowing, showing a small but reliably negative effect.

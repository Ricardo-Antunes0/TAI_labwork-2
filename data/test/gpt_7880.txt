La Schiavona ('the woman from Dalmatia'), also known as La Zingara ('the gypsy'), is an opera in three acts by Vincenzo Bellini. The Italian libretto was written by Antonio Somma and Isabella Colbran, based on a story by Giovanni Boccaccio.  The opera premiered on 9 January 1828 at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples. Bellini revised the opera for its second performance, which took place on 22 January 1828. La Schiavona was a great success, becoming one of his most popular operas. La Schiavona has been performed more than any other Bellini opera.  The opera is set in the court of the Duke of Urbino, who is in love with his niece Elvira. Elvira loves Sandro, a young man in the service of the duke, but she is prevented from marrying him because she is not of noble birth. The duke decides to marry her off to a stranger instead. A travelling minstrel, Zaccaria, arrives in Urbino and tells the duke of an enchanted princess, Schiavona, who is waiting for a true gentleman to rescue her from her tower. The duke sends for Zaccaria and orders him to bring Schiavona to Urbino. Zaccaria falls in love with Schiavona and decides to rescue her instead. The duke learns of this and orders Zaccaria to return Sch

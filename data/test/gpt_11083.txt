President's Pavilion is an official residence of the President of the United States. It is located in the northwest corner of the White House complex, on Pennsylvania Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets NW.  The current President's Pavilion was designed by James Hoban and built between 1837 and 1841, during the presidency of James K. Polk. The original structure was an octagon with a dome, constructed of red brick with white trim. It was replaced in 1876 by the present structure, which is in the Second Empire style. The pavilion is considered one of the most distinguished features of the White House complex.  The President's Pavilion has been used for official receptions and ceremonies, as well as for private living quarters for presidents. It has been the site of several presidential weddings, including that of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt in 1935, and Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter in 1977.

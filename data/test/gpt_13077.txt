Digital pathology is a sub-field of pathology that encompasses the study of the effects of digital technology on biological systems. It has become an increasingly important field as information technology has become more pervasive and complex.  Digital pathology is divided into three main areas: digital imaging and pathology, digital health, and digital forensics. Digital imaging and pathology focuses on the use of digital technology to capture and analyze images of bodies and tissues. Digital health focuses on the use of digital technology to monitor and manage health conditions, and digital forensics focuses on the use of digital technology to investigate crimes and forensic investigations.  Digital pathology has a number of benefits over traditional pathology techniques. For example, it is easier to conduct investigations in a digital environment because there is no need for physical specimens or laboratory equipment. Additionally, digital pathology can be used to examine images that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to view, such as images taken inside medical implants or inside the body during surgery.

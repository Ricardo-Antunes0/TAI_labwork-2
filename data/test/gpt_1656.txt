Makuria (Old Nubian: , Dotawo; ; ) is an ancient Nubian kingdom located in what is now southern Sudan.  Makuria was founded in the first half of the first millennium BC by a people known as the Makurians. The kingdom reached its greatest extent under king Kashta, who ruled from about 200 BC to about AD 150. After Kashta's death, the kingdom was divided among his sons. Makuria was eventually conquered by the Kingdom of Kush in the late first century AD.  The Makurian language is a member of the Nilo-Saharan family.

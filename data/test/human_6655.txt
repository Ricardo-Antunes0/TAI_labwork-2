Solvorn Church  is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Luster Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. It is located in the village of Solvorn. It is the church for the Solvorn parish which is part of the Sogn prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church design in 1883 using plans drawn up by the architect Waldemar Hansteen. The church seats about 300 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1340, but the church was not new at that time.  The first church was likely a wooden stave church built in the early 1300s (or earlier). Not much is known about the old church. The old church was torn down around the year 1600 and it was replaced by a new timber-framed long church on the same site. This new church had a nave measuring  with a  choir on one end.

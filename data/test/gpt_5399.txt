A sandwich board is a type of advertising or public information board. They are typically used to display information about products or services, and are often placed in public areas such as streets, sidewalks, and bus stops.  A sandwich board typically consists of a wooden or plastic frame with a sheet of paper or other material attached to one or both sides. The paper is usually mounted on a hinge so that it can be opened like a book, and is divided into several small panels which can be rotated to display different messages. These panels are usually painted with different colors to make them more visible from a distance.  The first sandwich boards were introduced in the early 1800s, when they were used to advertise theatrical performances. They gradually became more common during the mid-1900s, when they were used to advertise products and services ranging from food to clothing to cars. Today, sandwich boards are still used to advertise products and services, but they are also used to promote political messages and charitable causes.

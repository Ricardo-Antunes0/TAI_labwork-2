Hazarewal (Plural; Hazarewals, alternatively spelled as Hazara or Hazarawal; ) is term used for the multi-ethnic predominantly Hindko-speaking community belonging to the Hazara region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The term "Hindko" means Indian in the Pashto language and is used to refer to speakers of Indo-Aryan language dialects. The main tribes of Hazara are the Awan, Swati, Dhund Abbasi, Karlal, Jadoon, Qureshi, Gujjar, Tanoli, Karlal, Syed, Malik Deen Khel Pashtun, Swati, Utman zai, Khawaja, Sulemani (Suleman Khel), Ghakkar, Maddakhel, Kohistanis, Tareen), Qureshi, Mishwani, Piracha, Mir, Mughals, Tarkheli, Kashmiri, Dilazak, Shilmani and the Isazai tribe of Tor Ghar District. The Hazarewal or Hindkowans are not to be confused with the ethnic Hazara people inhabiting parts of Baluchistan province in Pakistan or areas of neighbouring Afghanistan. The Hazarewals have, over the last few years, found themselves increasingly in favour of separation and autonomy from the rest of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, on linguistic basis.

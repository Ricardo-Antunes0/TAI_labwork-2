Biography On 11 January 1954, Bright was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. She was the daughter of a family doctor. Bright learnt fine arts in London and then fashion and millinery in Leeds; despite this, she did not formally train as a designer. Bright did a brief apprenticeship period at Paris' Lanvin fashion house, where she learnt millinery's secrets. At Gelot, she sewed men's hats.

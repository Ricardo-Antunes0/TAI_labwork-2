Mariah Lopez (born 1985) is an American transgender activist and former sex worker, currently located in New York City. She works to address the issues around improving the lives of LBGTIQ population in the United States and more specifically for people of color and/or low income. Lopez is the executive director for STARR (Strategic Trans Alliance for Radical Reform), a transgender rights advocacy group. Activism In 2012, Lopez lobbied for the 1992 death of Marsha P. Johnson, a black transgender rights activist, to be reexamined with modern technology. Initially the case was considered a suicide but in 2012 the New York Police Department re-opened the case as possible homicide. In 2017, the documentary The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson was released by Netflix and Lopez was filmed for the documentary but not featured in the final film. The film prompted a discussion around who should tell the story of Marsha P. Johnson, and their power and relationship to profiting off of a marginalized community and sharing someone else's story. STARR (Strategic Trans Alliance for Radical Reform) is intended to be a reboot of Johnson and Riveraâ€™s organization STAR (Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries).

The North Staffordshire Coalfield was a coalfield located in the North Staffordshire area of England. Coal was first mined in the North Staffordshire Coalfield in the early 1800s, and it remained a significant coal-producing area until the 1970s. The North Staffordshire Coalfield is now largely agricultural, with some coal mining still taking place.

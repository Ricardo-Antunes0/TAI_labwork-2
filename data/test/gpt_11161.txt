Homalopoma luridum, with the common name: Dall's Hemispherical Snail, is a species of gastropod mollusk in the family Muricidae.  The size of the shell varies between 10 mm and 25 mm. The shell is light to dark brown, with a reddish-purple hue, often with a pinkish tinge. The spire is hemispherical and the surface is marked with minute radial ridges, giving the shell its characteristic "dall's hemispherical" appearance. The shell is smooth except for the apex and the umbilicus which is edged with a series of small, sharp teeth.  The species can be found in subtropical or tropical marine waters, preferring depths of 10 - 60 m. It feeds on algae and coral polyps.

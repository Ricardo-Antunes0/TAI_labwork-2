Byfjorden (Norwegian Nynorsk and Bokmål: /byːfjɔrn/, /-ɔɾn/; Bokmål: also /-ɔɳ/; Bergensk: usually /-ɔʁn/) is a fjord in Vestland county, Norway. The  long fjord separates the island of Askøy from the mainland Bergen Peninsula, passing right north of the city of Bergen on the mainland. The western entrance to Byfjorden is between the village of Drotningsvik in Laksevåg borough, Bergen, and the village of Marikoven on the island of Askøy in Askøy municipality. The northern entrance to the fjord is between the village of Ask on Askøy and Mjølkeråen in the borough of Åsane in Bergen.   On the northern end, it connects with the Salhusfjorden and Herdlefjorden.  There is one road crossing over the Byfjorden: the Askøy Bridge, which crosses near the western end of the fjord.  The name literally means city-fjord, and it is so named because of its importance as a transportation route into and out of the city of Bergen. Arms and bays

Saxo Bank is a Danish investment bank. It was founded in 1993 by Lars Saxo, a former McKinsey consultant. The company is headquartered in Copenhagen.  Saxo Bank has approximately 1,000 employees and is one of the ten largest banks in Denmark. The company's main activities are in the areas of investment banking, financial consulting, and asset management. Saxo Bank is one of the few Danish banks to operate internationally. The bank has offices in Copenhagen, London, New York City, Hong Kong, and Toronto.   In September 2007, Saxo Bank agreed to purchase a controlling stake in the Russian financial group Sberbank from the Russian government for â‚¬5 billion. The deal was subject to approval by the European Commission but was completed in December 2007. The acquisition gave Saxo Bank a presence in one of the world's largest banking markets and strengthened its position as one of Denmark's leading banks. In January 2016, it was announced that Saxo Bank would merge with Teller Group, an American investment bank.   The company has been involved in several high-profile scandals over the years, including accusations of insider trading during the financial crisis of 2007-8 and money laundering allegations made against its subsidiary, BofA Merrill Lynch, in 2014.

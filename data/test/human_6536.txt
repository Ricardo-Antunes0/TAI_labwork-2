Nunzio is a 1978 American drama film directed by Paul Williams and written by James Andronica. The film stars David Proval, James Andronica, Morgana King, Joe Spinell, Tovah Feldshuh and Maria Smith. The film was released on May 10, 1978, by Universal Pictures. Plot Nunzio Sabatino (David Proval) is a grown man with the demeanor of a young child. He lives at home with his doting mother (Morgana King) and has a job as a bicycle delivery man for Angelo (Joe Spinell), the neighborhood grocer, which Angelo provides as a favor for Nunzio's brother Jamesie (James Andronica). Nunzio is fixated on elements of superhero stories; he wears sweatshirts that he has emblazoned with a shield and a capital "N" in the style of Superman's shield, along with a cape, and often walks and jumps across his neighborhood's rooftops, stopping short of actually trying to fly. Younger children enjoy his company, particularly Georgie (Glenn Scarpelli), whom he suggests will one day have to take his place as neighborhood do-gooder. However, he is also constantly bullied by a gang of youths, led by JoJo (Vincent Russo), who enjoy ridiculing his dress and taking advantage of his diminished faculties.

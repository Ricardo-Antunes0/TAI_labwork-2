Günther Hessler (14 June 1909 – 4 October 1978) was a German-born Swiss mathematician who worked in the fields of differential geometry and algebra.  Hessler was born in Königsberg, East Prussia, the son of a Lutheran pastor. After completing his Abitur at the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium in Königsberg, he studied mathematics at the University of Breslau and then at the University of Zurich, where he received his doctorate in 1931 under the supervision of Felix Klein. After spending a year as a research assistant at the University of Göttingen, he moved to the University of Geneva in 1933, where he remained for the rest of his career.  Hessler's early work in differential geometry centred on questions concerning curvature and Riemannian geometry. He is credited with developing a theory known as Hesse geometry, which provides a rigorous foundation for various aspects of Riemannian geometry. In addition, he made significant contributions to the theory of quadratic forms and to variational calculus.  More recently, Hessler has been recognized for his work on algebraic geometry and its connections to commutative algebra. Among his major achievements are the development of a theory known as Hessler-Lagrange theory, which provides a unified framework for many problems in commutative algebra; and the discovery of a new type of algebraic structure known as Hessler varieties.  Hessler died in Geneva at the age of 74

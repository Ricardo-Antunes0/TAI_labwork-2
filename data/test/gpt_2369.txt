Peristeranthus hillii, commonly known as the beetle orchid, is a species of orchid that is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia.  The beetle orchid grows as a terrestrial herb with a single, erect stem up to 45 cm tall. The leaves are linear to lance-shaped and about 1 cm long. The flowers are white, pink or purple and are borne on a short stem above a green base. The flowers are pollinated by beetles which spread the pollen from one flower to another.  The beetle orchid is found near sandstone outcrops and limestone caves in the south-west of Western Australia. It is threatened by habitat loss.

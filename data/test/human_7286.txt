Gilbert is a given name of Norman-French origin, itself from Germanic Gisilberht or Gisalberht. Original spellings included Gislebert, Guilbert and Gilebert.  The first element, Gil-, comes from Germanic gÄ«sil, meaning "shaft of an arrow" or gisal "pledge, hostage", while the second element, -bert comes from Germanic -behrt, short form of beraht, meaning "bright" or "famous".  The name spread in France and was introduced to England by the Normans, where it was popular during the Middle Ages. That is the reason the pronunciation Gil-  reflects the Northern Norman one , as opposed to Old French  > French  and explains the alternative spelling Guilbert with Guil- . Variant spellings have evolved throughout Europe, including the Iberian/Italian version Gilberto and, as was the custom across Europe, given a Latin language version Gilbertus, to be used alongside a person's native variant. The diminutive, Gil, eventually became popular as a standalone given name or nickname.  Gilbert, with variant spellings, is also used as a surname (see Gilbert (surname)).

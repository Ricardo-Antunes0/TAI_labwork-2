The Naked Society is a 1964 book by Canadian author Robert Ardrey. It is a social commentary on human nature and the way humans live together in societies.  The book is divided into three parts. The first part, "The Hunting Society", discusses hunter-gatherer societies and their ways of life. The second part, "The Gathering Society", discusses the development of agriculture and the rise of civilizations. The third part, "The Scavenging Society", discusses how modern society has changed the way humans live.  Ardrey's theory is that all human societies are based on two fundamental needs: the need to belong and the need to be feared. Ardrey describes the different ways in which these needs are expressed in different societies. He argues that hunter-gatherer societies are the most primitive and egalitarian societies, because they lack both the need to belong and the need to be feared. Civilization, according to Ardrey, is based on the development of the need to belong and the need to be feared. Ardrey believes that this change is responsible for many of the problems in modern society, such as McCarthyism and nuclear weapons.

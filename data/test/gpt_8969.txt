James Craig (31 October 1739 â€“ 23 September 1813) was a Scottish architect who is principally remembered for his designs for the neoclassical style of public buildings in Britain and Ireland.  Born in Edinburgh, Craig received his early training from his father, who was a sculptor. He became a pupil of the architect James Adam, and began working in his office in 1760. In 1768 he set up his own practice, and became one of the most successful architects of his day. His major works include the Royal Exchange (1768), the Bank of Scotland (1791), and the Custom House, Dublin (1798). He also designed churches, mansions, and other public buildings.  Craig was a prolific artist, and many of his drawings and models are now preserved in the British Museum. He died in London.

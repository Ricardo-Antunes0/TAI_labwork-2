My Real Children is a 2014 alternate history novel by American author Kurt Vonnegut.  The novel is set in the year 2081, in which the world is divided into two regions: the "Haven" and the "Wilderness." The Haven is a prosperous, industrialized society where people enjoy a high standard of living and freedom from disease and violence. The Wilderness is a lawless region inhabited by dangerous mutants and criminals.   Vonnegut's protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, is a white-collar worker living in the Haven. One day, he is randomly selected to be exiled to the Wilderness, where he meets a group of people who challenge his assumptions about life and society. Ultimately, Pilgrim learns that the true meaning of happiness lies in accepting oneself for who one is.

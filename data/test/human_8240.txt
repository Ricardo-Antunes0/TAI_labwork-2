The Derbyshire Arrows are an English basketball club based in Dronfield, Derbyshire.  The Arrows play in National Basketball League Division 2 North, the third tier of British basketball. The club also have strong links with the city of Sheffield, having formerly been based at the University of Sheffield, and maintaining a partnership with the University's team. History Founded in 1991 to compete in local league competition, the Men's team joined the National Basketball League in 1998, starting in Division 3.  The first couple of years in national competition saw mixed results, before changes at both club and league in 2000 ushered in a golden era for the club.  First, former BBL talent Garnet Gayle joined as player/coach, closely followed by a restructure of the league which rebranded the third tier as Division 2.  The Arrows then claimed the 2000/2001 league title without suffering a single defeat, earning promotion to Division 1 in the process.  Further glories were to follow, taking back-to-back doubles of the league and playoff titles in 2001/2002 and 2002/2003.  However, the club were denied a promotion to the NBL Conference as their home court did not meet the minimum standard required.

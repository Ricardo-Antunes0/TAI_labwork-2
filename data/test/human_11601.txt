The Moore-Mayo House is a historic house on Lighthouse Road in Bass Harbor, a village of Tremont, Maine.  The architecturally vernacular house was built beginning in 1947 by the authors Ruth Moore and Eleanor Mayo, who lived and wrote there until their respective deaths in 1989 and 1981.  Moore in particular has been cited as a major mid-20th century writer of Maine culture.  The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description and history The Moore-Mayo House is set on the west side of Lighthouse Road, on a property which extends down to the shore.  The main house is set near the road, sheltered from it by a lilac hedge.  Overgrown fields extend down to the shore, where there is a small wood-frame "camp" cabin with deck.  The main house is a single-story vernacular wood-frame structure, which grew organically over time as the two women expanded it.  It has a main square component at its center, with wings added to the west and south sides.  These sections are each covered by a gable roof whose rafter ends are exposed.

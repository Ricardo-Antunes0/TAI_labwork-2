Whaling in Iceland began with spear-drift hunting in the late Viking Age. From the 17th century onwards, whaling became an important source of income for the Icelandic people. The first factory for processing whale oil was established in 1868.   The industry declined in the mid-20th century, but has since been revived. In 1997, Iceland became the first country to issue a whaling quota under the International Whaling Commission (IWC). In recent years, Iceland has conducted limited whaling in accordance with its quota. There is currently no commercial whaling in Iceland.

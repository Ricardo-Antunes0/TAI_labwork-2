The Treasury-class cutter was a group of three Royal Navy warships that were designed for general use as patrol vessels. The class was generally successful, with a number of vessels still in service in the early 21st century.  The cutter was designed in the mid-19th century to replace the ageing sloops of the Royal Navy's hydrographic survey fleet. The first vessel, HMS "Treasury", was ordered in 1846, and the class saw active service throughout the Victorian era and into the early years of the 20th century.  The class was generally successful, with a number of vessels still in service in the early 21st century. They were generally fast and manoeuvrable ships, which made them suitable for general use as patrol vessels. However, they were not well-armed, and were often used to escort convoys or to patrol British waters.

Architectural determinism (also sometimes referred to as structural determinism) is the theory that the design and structure of buildings, structures, or other physical objects determine their function and use.  Historically, the idea that architectural form determines function has been controversial. Many architects have argued that it is the combination of function with design that creates a successful building. Others have claimed that the purpose of architecture is to create an environment that is comfortable and aesthetically pleasing to humans.  There is no single answer to this question, as the role of architecture depends on the individual and the culture in which they live. However, architectural determinism has played an important role in shaping how buildings are used and understood throughout history.

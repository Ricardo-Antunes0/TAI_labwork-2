Bessie Clayton (c. 1875 â€“ July 16, 1925) was an American blues singer and pianist.  Clayton was born in poverty in the small town of Bolton, in northern Mississippi, sometime around 1875. She began singing and playing the piano at an early age. By the early 1900s, she had moved to Chicago, Illinois, where she became a successful blues singer and pianist. Her music was strongly influenced by the blues tradition of Robert Johnson and Ma Rainey. Clayton died in Chicago in 1925 at the age of 52.

Lough Neagh  is a large freshwater lake in County Down, Northern Ireland. It is the largest lake entirely in Northern Ireland, and the third largest in the United Kingdom. With an area of 1,752 km2 (690 sq mi), it is about twice the size of London.  Lough Neagh is fed by 15 small rivers, including the Creggan, Blackwater, and Lagan. The catchment area of these rivers totals about 152 km2 (59 sq mi). The lake is also fed by groundwater from the surrounding countryside. The water level in the lake varies seasonally, reaching a maximum height of 124 m (407 ft) above sea level during the summer months. The average depth of the lake is about 9 m (29 ft).  Lough Neagh supports a wide range of aquatic life, including two endangered species: the European eel and the European perch. The lake has been designated a Ramsar Site because of its significant wetland and aquatic resource values.

West of Sunshine is a film set and shot in the western suburbs of Melbourne, Australia, and depicts an eventful day in the life of working-class Jimmy, an inveterate gambler, and his estranged son Alex. Plot Scruffy-haired, heavily tattooed Jimmy (Damian Hill) is a courier for a small company, and has a $15,000 debt to Banos (Tony Nikolakopoulos), the tough owner of a car repair shop where Jimmy once worked, and who has given him a deadline of 5 o'clock that day to repay him or suffer dire consequences. Jimmy's mind is preoccupied with the prospects of a horse that's running (race two at Ballarat) that day. He picks up his mate Steve (Arthur Angel), a fellow courier. He is late to pick up his pre-pubescent son Alex (Hill's real-life stepson Tyler Perham), who he's promised to baby-sit that day, and is harassed by his ex-wife Karen (Faye Smythe). He arrives at her house in his car, an immaculate 1968 Ford Fairlane, previously owned from new by his own father, who deserted his family when Jimmy was young.

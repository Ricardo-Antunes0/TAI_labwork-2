The SM-65E Atlas, or Atlas-E, was an American intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) developed by the United States. It was replaced in operational service by the SM-82 Atlas II. The Atlas-E was first flown on 14 October 1958, and entered service with the U.S. Air Force in 1959. The Atlas-E was a two-stage IRBM with a maximum range of 5,500 kilometers (3,400 mi).  The SM-65E Atlas constituted the backbone of the U.S. IRBM force for many years. It was initially deployed with four squadrons at Dyess Air Force Base, Texas; F. E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming; Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana; and Thule Air Base, Greenland. The Atlas-E was also used as part of the Strategic Air Command's deterrent force during the late Cold War era. In 1986, all remaining Atlas-Es were declared obsolete and withdrawn from service.

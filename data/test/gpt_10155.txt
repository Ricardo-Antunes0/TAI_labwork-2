The Cod Wars (; also known as the Cod Wars of the North Atlantic) were a series of naval engagements between the United Kingdom and Iceland in the late 1940s. The Cod Wars were fought over the issue of fishing rights in disputed areas of the North Atlantic.  The first Cod War began on 16 November 1946, when Iceland arrested a British trawler, the "John B. Ford", on a charge of poaching. The British government responded by dispatching a naval vessel, the "Huntress", to Iceland to release the trawler and expel the Icelandic crew. The British won the first Cod War, but Iceland continued to prosecute cases of poaching throughout the conflict.  The second Cod War began on 5 May 1949, when Icelandic fishermen caught three British trawlers off the coast of Iceland. The British government responded by dispatching two warships, the "Prince of Wales" and the "Repulse", to Iceland to detain the Icelandic fishermen and expel their crews. The British won the second Cod War, but Iceland continued to protest British fishing operations in disputed areas of the North Atlantic.  The third Cod War began on 18 August 1958, when Icelandic fishing boats caught eight British trawlers near Cape Wrath. The British government responded by dispatching two warships, HMS "Repulse" and HMS "Prince of Wales", to Iceland to seize control of the Icelandic boats and expel their crews. The British won the third Cod War, but Iceland continued to protest British fishing operations in disputed areas of the North Atlantic.

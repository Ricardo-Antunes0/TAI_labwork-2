Advice (also called exhortation) is a form of communication in which someone communicates a piece of advice. It is often given in a informal setting, and can be either explicit or implicit. The advice may be about how to live one's life, what to do, or how to think.  Advice is a form of communication that can be explicit or implicit. Explicit advice is when the advice giver states explicitly what the listener should do. Implicit advice, on the other hand, is when the advice is implied rather than stated. Implicit advice can be found in expressions such as "walk away" or "keep your head down."  Advice can be given in a formal or informal setting. Formal advice is typically given in a setting where there is a hierarchy of authority, such as a school or workplace. In contrast, informal Advice is typically given between friends or family members who are familiar with each other and have a trusting relationship.  There are many types of advice, including practical advice and moral advice. Practical advice deals with how to live one's life, such as how to cook a meal or how to fix a car. Moral Advice deals with issues such as ethics or morality.

A food web  is the natural web of interconnected organisms and their environment that supports their life. It is a graphical representation of the food chain, showing the different levels of organisation from the smallest organisms to the largest predators.  A food web typically divides the world into four or five trophic levels, with organisms at the bottom of the food chain feeding on organisms higher up in the chain. The trophic levels are:   The first level, called the base level, is made up of single-celled organisms such as bacteria and algae.  The second level is made up of small invertebrates such as insects and crustaceans.  The third level is made up of medium-sized invertebrates such as spiders, worms, and beetles.  The fourth level is made up of large invertebrates such as lions, tigers, and whales.   The fifth and final level is made up of apex predators such as sharks and lions.

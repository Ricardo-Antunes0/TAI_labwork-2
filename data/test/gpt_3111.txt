Mz 1 (Menzel 1), is a bipolar black hole located in the constellation Hercules. In 2015, it was discovered to have a strong radio emission, potentially from a disk of gas and dust orbiting it.  Mz 1 was discovered by the Italian Menzel 1 telescope in 2015. It is located in the constellation Hercules, about 190,000 light years from Earth. It has a mass of about 12 times that of the Sun and a diameter of about 9 solar radii.  Mz 1 is a bipolar black hole with an apparent mass of about 12 solar masses and an inferred diameter of about 9 solar radii. The inferred mass is based on the limited information available about Mz 1's properties; it could be larger or smaller according to these estimates. The inferred size is based on the assumption that Mz 1 has the same overall shape and size as other black holes with similar masses and radii.  A strong radio emission has been detected from Mz 1, which could be from a disk of gas and dust orbiting the black hole. This emission could be originating from material falling into or being heated by the black hole, or from radiation emitted by the gas and dust orbiting the black hole. The origin of this emission is not known yet, but further observations are needed to determine its cause.

The dragon boundary marks are cast iron statues of dragons on metal or stone plinths that mark the boundaries of the City of London.  The dragons are painted silver, with details of their wings and tongue picked out in red.  The dragon stands on one rear leg, the other lifted against a shield, with the right foreleg raised and the left foreleg holding a shield which bears the City of London's coat of arms, painted in red and white. This stance is the equivalent of the rampant heraldic attitude of the supporters of the City's arms. Design The design is based on two large dragon sculptures,  high, which were mounted above the entrance to the Coal Exchange on Lower Thames Street, designed by the City Architect, J. B. Bunning, and made by the London founder Dewer in 1849. The dragons were preserved when the Coal Exchange was demolished in 1962â€“63. The two original statues were re-erected on  high plinths of Portland stone at the western boundary of the City, by Temple Gardens on Victoria Embankment, in October 1963.

The Dassault Rafale (, literally meaning "gust of the wind" in French) is a French twin-engine, canard-delta wing, jet fighter designed and built by Dassault Aviation. The Rafale is produced by Dassault's subsidiary, Dassault Systemes.  The Rafale was conceived in the late 1970s as a replacement for the Mirage III and the Alpha Jet. The aircraft was initially designed to be powered by two General Electric F404 engines but the programme was later switched to using the newer Snecma M88 engines. The Rafale entered service with the French Air Force in 1996 and has since been exported to 24 countries.

Ambroise Rendu (25 October 1778 – 12 February 1832) was a French neoclassical painter, sculptor, and architect.  Born in Nantes, Brittany, Rendu studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris under Jacques-Louis David. He exhibited for the first time at the Paris Salon in 1800, and became a member of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in 1802. He also became a member of the Institute in 1816. Rendu is noted for his historical paintings, such as "The Battle of Zama" (1827), and for his busts, which are sometimes characterized as expressive and sometimes as stylized.

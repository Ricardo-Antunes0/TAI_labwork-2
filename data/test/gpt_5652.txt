Isinglass (1890–1911) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was the leading British two-year-old of 1899 and was unbeaten in four races including the Epsom Derby. He was then retired to stud where he had considerable success as a sire of racehorses.  Isinglass was a "big, powerfully built horse" with a "broad, deep chest and powerful hindquarters". He was very fast in short sprints and had good stamina.  Isinglass was bred by his owner, Lord Derby, at his stud in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York. He was sired by the 1875 American Horse of 1876, also known as The Flying Dutchman, who was the leading American three-year-old of 1876. Isinglass' dam, Lady Alice (1864–1907), was a daughter of the British racehorse Eclipse and a sister to the influential broodmare Tigris. She won eleven races including the Oaks Stakes and the 2000 Guineas.

The Treaty of Hubertusburg  was signed on 15 February 1493 between the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III and Sigismund of Luxembourg. The treaty ended the War of the Burgundian Succession, in which Sigismund had supported Charles the Bold against Frederick III.  The Treaty of Hubertusburg was significant in that it marked the end of the Middle Ages and ushered in the Renaissance. It also enhanced Sigismund's status as a royal prince and increased his power over the duchies of Brabant, Limburg, and Luxemburg.

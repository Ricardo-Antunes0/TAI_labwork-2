Distant View (9 May 1991 â€“ 12 November 2006) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was best known for his wins in the 1991 Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes, both of which made him the first horse to win both races in the same year. Distant View also won the Breeders' Cup Classic, setting a new track record in the process. After retiring from racing, he had some success as a breeding stallion.  Distant View was bred in Kentucky by J. P. Richardson. He was sired by Northern Dancer, who won nine Grade I races including the 1968 Belmont Stakes and the 1970 Preakness Stakes. His dam was Lady's Secret, who won one minor race and was descended from stakes winner Brewster's Millions.  As a two-year-old, Distant View raced mainly in California but finished second in a race at New York's Saratoga Race Course. He then recorded his biggest victory when he won the $175,000 1991 Preakness Stakes over older horses. The win made him the first horse to win both the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes in the same year. In addition, he won the $600,000 Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa Anita Park on November 3rd setting a new track record.  Distant View retired from racing at the end of his three-year-old season and began breeding stallions at his stud farm

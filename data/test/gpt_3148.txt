The Rhode Island Rebellion were an American rebellion against British rule in the Thirteen Colonies. The rebellion began on November 15, 1774, and ended on May 4, 1776.  The cause of the rebellion was taxation without representation, as well as other grievances such as the lack of religious freedom and the restrictions placed on American trade by the British Parliament. The major participants in the rebellion were the colonists in the Thirteen Colonies of North America. The rebellion began in Rhode Island and quickly spread to the other colonies.  Although not a successful war effort, the rebellion demonstrated that a unified American effort could resist British forces. After the rebellion was over, the British enacted a series of policies known as the Intolerable Acts, which attempted to punish the rebels and solidify their control over the colonies.

Muscat d'Eisenstadt (also known as Muscat de Muscat or simply Muscat) is a wine grape variety grown primarily in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region of Italy.  Muscat d'Eisenstadt is a variety that is noted for its high acidity and sweetness, which can make for wines that are both fruity and floral. The grape is also known for its ability to produce wines that are lively and medium-bodied, with a rich flavor profile.  While Muscat d'Eisenstadt is not as well-known as some other varieties, it is still popular in Italy and abroad, and has been used to produce a wide range of wines. Some of the most famous examples of Muscat d'Eisenstadt wines include the Moscato d'Asti and the Rosso di Montepulciano.

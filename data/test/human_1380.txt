Tool Box is the fifth studio album from American country music artist Aaron Tippin. It features the singles "That's as Close as I'll Get to Loving You", "Without Your Love", "Everything I Own" and "How's the Radio Know". "That's as Close as I'll Get to Loving You" reached Number One on the Billboard country charts in 1995, giving Tippin the second Number One of his career. "Without Your Love" reached #22, and the other two singles both missed Top 40 in the U.S. The album was certified gold by the RIAA. "You've Always Got Me" was previously recorded by Pearl River on their 1994 album Pearl River, and "Ten Pound Hammer" would later be recorded by Barbara Mandrell on her 1997 album It Works for Me. Additionally, "I Can Help" is a cover of a song originally released by country-pop artist Billy Swan in 1973. "Country Boy's Tool Box" is also reprised from Tippin's 1994 album Lookin' Back at Myself.

Philipp Christoph Zeller (8 April 1808 – 27 March 1883) was a German entomologist. Zeller was born at Steinheim an der Murr, Württemberg, two miles from Marbach, the birthplace of Schiller. The family moved to Frankfurt (Oder) where Philipp went to the gymnasium where natural history was not taught. Instead, helped by Alois Metzner, he taught himself entomology mainly by copying books. Copying and hence memorising, developed in response to early financial privation became a lifetime habit. Zeller went next to the University of Berlin where he became a candidat, which is the first degree, obtained after two or three years' study around 1833. The subject was philology. He became an Oberlehrer or senior primary school teacher in Glogau in 1835. Then he became an instructor at the secondary school in Frankfurt (Oder) and in 1860 he was appointed as the senior instructor of the highest technical high school in Meseritz. He resigned this post after leaving in 1869 for Stettin, home of the Stettin Entomological Society.

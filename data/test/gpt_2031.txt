Googly eyes, or wiggle eyes, are small, animated, cartoon-like eyes that are commonly used in cartoons and children's movies. They are usually blue or green, but can be any color.  The eyes may be used for comic or scary effects, but are most commonly associated with the character Goofy from Disney's animated film "The Mickey Mouse Club" and its sequels. Googly eyes have been used in many other cartoons and children's movies since then, most notably in the characters of Popeye the Sailor and Woody Woodpecker.

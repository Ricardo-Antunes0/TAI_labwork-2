Chloroscombrus is a genus containing two species of tropical to temperate water marine fish in the jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae. Both members are commonly known as bumpers or bumperfish, with one species endemic to the Atlantic and the other to the eastern Pacific. They have a convex ventral profile compared to most other carangids, with small oblique mouths and low dorsal and anal fins. Phylogenetic studies have found they are most closely related to the jacks of the genus Hemicaranx, with these genera plus Selar, Selaroides and possibly Alepes, making up a clade within the Caranginae subfamily. They are predatory fish which live in both inshore and offshore environments ranging from estuaries to the edge of the continental shelf, and are of moderate importance to fisheries. Taxonomy and phylogeny Chloroscombrus is a genus containing two extant species. It is part of the jack family, Carangidae, which in turn is part of the order Carangiformes. Recent phylogenetic studies using molecular information have placed Chloroscombrus in the subfamily Caranginae (or the tribe Carangini). The most recent phylogenetic study found the genus is very closely related to Hemicaranx, with the genera Selar, Selaroides and possibly Alepes also placed in a clade within the Carangini. The study also strongly supported the monophyly of Chloroscombrus

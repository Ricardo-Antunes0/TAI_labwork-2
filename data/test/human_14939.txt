The Jenkins' whipray (Pateobatis jenkinsii) is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae, with a wide distribution in the Indo-Pacific region from South Africa to the Malay Archipelago to northern Australia. This large species grows to  across and has a broad, diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc and a whip-like tail without fin folds. It has a band of heart-shaped dermal denticles running from between the eyes to the tail on its upper surface, along with a characteristic row of large spear-like thorns along the midline. It is uniform yellowish brown above, becoming grayish on the tail past the stinging spine, and white below; there is apparently a spotted color variant that had previously been described as a different species, the dragon stingray (H. draco). Preying mainly on small bony fishes and crustaceans, the Jenkins' whipray is commonly found in inshore, sandy or silty habitats shallower than . It is aplacental viviparous, with the females nourishing their developing young with histotroph ("uterine milk"). This species is regularly caught by coastal fisheries across much of its range, particularly in the Arafura Sea; its skin is highly valued for the large thorns, while the meat and cartilage may also be marketed. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the Jenkins' whipray under Vulnerable, noting that it faces minimal conservation threats off northern Australia, which encompasses a large portion of its range. However, there is intense fishing pressure in Southeast Asia and has led to significant population declines there.

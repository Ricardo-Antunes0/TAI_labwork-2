Idse is an island in Strand municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. The  island lies between the Idsefjorden and Høgsfjorden, about  west of the town of Jørpeland.  The island of Idsal lies immediately to the south and the island of Heng lies a short distance to the north of Idse.  There is a bridge connecting Idse to neighboring Idsal, which in turn is connected to the mainland. Description There are about 40 farms on the south and east sides of the island, but in recent years there has been a significant decline with only three active dairy farmers remaining. The other farms grow potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, strawberries, blueberries, and Christmas trees.  The north and west sides of the island are more hilly and forested and that area is populated with many holiday cabins. At Tangane and Kjeksevåg, there are cabins that date back to the 1940s. There were families from the Stavanger area who fled the city during World War II and built cottages on Idse. In recent years, the cottage development has been very expansive, which probably has to do with good location near the cities of Stavanger and Sandnes. There are currently between 300 and 400 condos on the island.  Historically, there was a grocery store and post office on the pier at Idse, but both are now closed. In 1917, a telephone line was built between Jørpeland and Idse.

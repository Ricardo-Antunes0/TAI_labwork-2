Edith Nash (July 12, 1913 â€“ November 7, 1998) was an American writer and editor.  Nash was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family. She earned her undergraduate degree from Vassar College in 1934 and her M.A. from the University of Chicago in 1937. She worked as a journalist for the "New York Herald Tribune" and the "Chicago Sun-Times" before joining the United States Army during World War II. After the war, she became an editor at Random House. She was the co-founder of The Paris Review in 1953 and served as its editor emerita until her death in 1998.  Nash was noted for her feminist writing, which often focused on women's relationships with men. Her best-known work is "The Female Eunuch", a scathing satire of late 20th century feminism that has been described as one of the most influential books of the century.

Dillegrout or dilligrout is a dish traditionally presented at the coronations of kings and queens of England by the holders of the manor of Addington in a kitchen serjeanty. It is generally thought to be a soup or stew made from almond milk, capon, sugar, and spices, but a porridge-like dish of other ingredients has been described. Dillegrout was first presented in 1068 at the coronation of Matilda of Flanders, wife of William the Conqueror, and its final presentation was at the coronation of George IV in 1821. History  The soup was first presented in 1068 at the coronation of Matilda of Flanders, the wife of William the Conqueror, by Tezelin, the royal cook. The couple liked the soup so much they presented Tezelin with the manor of Addington; to hold the manor he and his descendants would be required to present the dish at all coronations in perpetuity. This type of requirement, a kitchen or culinary serjeanty, was referred to by J. Horace Round as the "Maupygernon serjeanty" or the Addington serjeanty.

Russian Fedora Remix was a remix of the Fedora Linux Linux distribution adapted for Russia that was active in 2008â€“2019. It was neither a copy of the original Fedora nor a new Linux distribution. The project aimed to ensure that Fedora fully satisfied the needs of Russian users with many additional features provided out of the box (e.g., specific software packages, preinstalled drivers for popular graphics processors, manuals in Russian). In autumn 2019 the project was phased out because its leaders announced that it "had fulfilled its purpose by 100%" and all of the Russian-centric improvements were officially included in Fedora repositories, and Russian Fedora software maintainers became regular Fedora maintainers. History  The project was originally established by Arkady "Tigro" Shain under the name Tedora. The main inspiration for this was Fedora 9 being very inconvenient for Russian users with a bug impeding successful installation when the packages were customized.

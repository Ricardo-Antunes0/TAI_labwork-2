The Campaign for Democracy (CD)  is a Nigerian civil society group that advocates for greater democracy in Nigeria. The group was first organized in the early 1990s to demand an end to the country's military dictatorship. The coalition organized demonstrations, strikes, and other civil resistance actions against the regime of Nigerian president Ibrahim Babangida from 1991â€“1993, particularly against the nullification of the  1993 Nigerian presidential election. At its peak, the coalition had more than 40 affiliated groups. Context  The Nigerian Second Republic was overthrown in a military coup led by General Muhammadu Buhari, which established a military dictatorship under the control of the Supreme Military Council. Buhari was subsequently overthrown by Ibrahim Babangida. Babangida followed several policies to loosen political control, including easing restrictions on freedom of expression. He also promised to return the country to civilian rule by 1990. However, Babangida repeatedly delayed liberalization measures, and civil society leaders did not have faith that he would genuinely give up power. One attempt to return the country to democracy through a national conference was repressed by the government in September 1990, leading several civil society leaders to the conclusion that forming an organized pressure group to push for democratization was crucial.

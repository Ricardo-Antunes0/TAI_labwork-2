The term cosmic variance is the statistical term for the discrepancy between the predictions of classical statistical mechanics and the observations of particle physics. It is a long-standing problem in physics that has yet to be resolved. The discrepancy may arise from a number of sources, including the lack of a complete theory of the fundamental forces, effective field theories that are not accurate enough, or observational errors.  Cosmic variance refers to the difference between predictions from classical statistical mechanics and observations of subatomic particles. Classical statistical mechanics is a theory of how matter behaves at the atomic and subatomic level, and it is based on the assumption that all particles behave according to simple laws. However, this is not always the case, as particles can be subject to complex interactions. This discrepancy is known as cosmic variance, and it has been a long-standing problem in physics that has yet to be resolved.  One source of cosmic variance is the lack of a complete theory of the fundamental forces. In classical statistical mechanics, all particles are assumed to be subject to the same set of forces. However, this is not always the case, as different particles can be affected by different types of forces. For example, subatomic particles like electrons are influenced by the force of gravity, while protons are influenced by the strong and weak nuclear forces. It is difficult to account for these different forces in a single theory, and this leads to discrepancies between predictions from classical statistical mechanics and observations.  Another source of cosmic variance is effective field theories. Effective field theories

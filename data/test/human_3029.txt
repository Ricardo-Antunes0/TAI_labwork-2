Dinas Cromlech or Dinas y Gromlech is a distinctive rhyolite rock outcrop at the Llanberis Pass, in Snowdonia, northwest Wales, which has a distinctive "open book" shape that is clearly visible from the road (A4086), and is very popular for rock climbers. Climbing history The obvious traditional climbing route up the deep ninety degree angled corner resisted attempts for many years until it was climbed by Joe Brown in 1952, and called Cenotaph Corner (1952, E1 5c, with Doug Belshaw).  The outcrop is an important rock climbing venue in Britain, and the corner includes some of the famous traditional climbing routes in British rock climbing history, including  Cemetery Gates (E1 6c) by Don Whillans in 1951, Left Wall (E2 5c) by Ron Moseley in 1956, Right Wall (E5 6c) by Pete Livesey in 1974, and Lord of the Flies (E6 6a) by Ron Fawcett in 1979. It also includes some of the most intimidating traditional climbs in Britain, such as Steve Mayer's 1992 climb, Nightmayer (E8 6c), from which climbers risk very large falls.

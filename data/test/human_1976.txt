was the fifty-sixth of the sixty-nine stations of the Nakasendō connecting Edo with Kyoto in Edo period Japan. It is located in former Mino Province in what is now Akasaka neighborhood of the city of Ōgaki,  Gifu Prefecture, Japan. History Akasaka is an ancient place name, and appears in the late Heian period Heiji Monogatari as then location where Minamoto no Shigenari sacrificed his son to rescue Minamoto no Yoshitomo. The area is largely a flat landscape noted for its red earth(hence the name "Akasaka", which means "red slope"). The area was known in the Edo Period for its lime kilns producing quicklime for use as fertilizer, and for its marble processing industry. The village of Akasaka was at an intersection of the Nakasendō with a road to the Buddhist temple of Kegon-ji, the 33rd and final stop on the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage. The town was also an important port located on the Kuise-gawa River.

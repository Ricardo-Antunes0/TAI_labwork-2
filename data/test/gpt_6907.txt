Troy  is an opera in two acts by Heinrich Schütz with a libretto by Christoph Martin Wieland. The work was first produced in 1637 at the court of Duke Johann Friedrich of Saxe-Weissenfels in Weissenfels. It is Schütz's only opera.  The opera tells the story of the siege of Troy and the fall of its king, Ilus. It is notable for its choral writing, including a setting of the Te Deum by Matthias Claudius, and its use of a variety of vocal styles.

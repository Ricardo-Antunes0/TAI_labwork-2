The Theme of the Aegean Sea (, thema tou Aigaiou Pelagous) was a Byzantine province in the northern Aegean Sea, established in the mid-9th century. As one of the Byzantine Empire's three dedicated naval themes (Greek: ), it served chiefly to provide ships and troops for the Byzantine navy, but also served as a civil administrative circumscription. Origins The theme has its origins in the late antique civil province of the "Islands" , which encompassed the islands of the southeastern and eastern Aegean up to Tenedos. The term "Aigaion Pelagos" appears for the first time as an administrative circumscription in the early 8th century, when seals of several of its kommerkiarioi (customs officials) are attested. One seal, dated to 721/722, even refers to an official in charge of all the Greek islands, possibly implying an extension of the old province over the islands of the northern and western Aegean as well. Militarily, the Aegean islands came under control of the Karabisianoi corps and later of the Cibyrrhaeot Theme during the 7th and 8th centuries.  In 726, the Byzantine emperor  Leo III forbade praying for icons and began to remove them from the churches. Against him did Agallianos Kontoskeles - military leader of Hellas (theme) rebel. The rebels were joined by the head of the fleet of the Cyclades islands, Stephen. They proclaimed Cosmas their own emperor, and began a campaign against Constantinople, where they were defeated with the help of Greek fire by the superior forces of Leo III. From the late 8th century, however, two separate commands appear in the Aegean: the droungarios of the Aegean Sea (Aigaion Pelagos), apparently controlling the northern half, and the droungarios "of the Twelve Islands" (Dodekanesos) or "of the Gulf" (Kolpos), in charge of the southern half. The latter command eventually evolved into the theme of Samos, while the former evolved into the theme of the Aegean Sea, encompassing both the islands of the northern Aegean as well as the Dardanelles and the southern coasts of the Propontis.

Dares philippinensis is a species of stick insects. This species is not native to Borneo like most other members of the genus Dares, but to the Philippine island Palawan. Characteristics  The insects show in both sexes the typical habitus for the genus. The antennae consist of 24 segments. Their basal segment (scapus) is flat and has a tooth on the outside. The  long females have a body surface covered by tubercles. While most of the other females of the genus have no spines, the females of Dares philippinensis can often have relatively clear spines at the widest point of meso- and metanotum on the lateral edge, whereby a short spike is formed per segment and side. In the top view, four spines can be seen. The coloring of the females is more contrasting than that of the males. Usually a lighter brown dominates, which often deviates into a reddish shade. There are also darker specimens and those with dark brown patterns. The pair of white spots typical of many older nymphs of the genus at the base of the abdomen is often still a light area in the adult females of this species to find. Overall, the females resemble those of Dares verrucosus. This also applies to the  long males. Their basic color is usually a light brown. Black spots or dots can be found especially on the rear area of the meso- and metanotum and can merge to form lines. In addition, a black-brown continuous line runs along the side of the pleura of meso- and metathorax. There are no distinct spines on the top of the meso- and metanotum. Only on the side are four spines in the same places where they can also appear in the females. In addition, the males have four distinct spines on their heads. The tibiae of their legs are colored black. On the upper side of the abdomen there are small lobes on the segments that grow larger towards the end of the abdomen.

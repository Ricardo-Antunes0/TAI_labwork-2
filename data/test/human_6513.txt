Polina is a Greek (Πωλίνα), French, Russian feminine given name of Latin origin. It is sometimes a short form of the name Apollinariya, a feminine form of the ancient Greek name Apollinaris, a name derived from the Greek god Apollo. In Greek mythology Apollo was the son of Zeus and Leto and the twin of Artemis. He was the god of prophecy, medicine, music, art, law, beauty, and wisdom. Later he also became the god of the sun and light. Apollinaris is the name of several ancient Christian saints.  Saint Apollonia was an early Christian martyr venerated in the Catholic Church and the patron saint of dentists and those battling problems with their teeth. Polina could also be seen as a variant spelling of the name Paulina, a feminine form of the name Paul or Paulus, or Pauline which is a French form of Paulina, a female version of Paulinus, a variant of Paulus meaning the little, hence the younger.

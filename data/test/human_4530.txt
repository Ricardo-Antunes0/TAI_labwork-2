He convinces Princeton University's college football star, Carter "the Bullet" Rutherford, to join the Bulldogs, hoping to capitalize on Carter's fame as a decorated hero of the First World War (like Alvin York, he single-handedly captured a large group of German soldiers).  In addition to his legendary tales of combat heroism, Carter has dashing good looks and unparalleled speed and skill on the field.  As a result of his presence, both the Bulldogs and pro football in general begin to prosper.

Many passenger trains (usually medium and long-distance) stop at stations with toilets. These toilets are usually located in a separate room next to the platform, and passengers have to leave the train and go to the toilet.   Passenger trains have been using toilets since the late 1800s. In those days, most people travelled by horse and carriage, so there was no need for a toilet on the train. However, as more people started travelling by train, it became necessary to provide a toilet on board.   Originally, passenger trains used buckets to defecate and urinate. However, this was not always satisfactory, because it was difficult to clean the buckets after use. In the 1930s, a type of toilet known as a 'passenger train toilet' was developed. This toilet consists of a small cubicle with a door on one side. The cubicle is fitted with a toilet seat and a washbasin. The door can be locked from the outside, so that no one can access the cubicle while it is in use.   Today, passenger trains use toilets almost exclusively. The only exception is high-speed trains, which usually do not stop at stations with toilets. Instead, they use 'toilets in transport' (TIT), which are similar to passenger train toilets but are located in different parts of the train.

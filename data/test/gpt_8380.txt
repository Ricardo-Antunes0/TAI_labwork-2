"The Shakespeare Code" is the second episode of the first series of the British television show Midsomer Murders.  In the episode, Barnaby and Troy investigate a potential murder at a theatre. They realise that the victim may have been killed because they were reading from The Shakespeare Code, a book of Shakespearean plays that supposedly contain hidden messages.  The episode was written by director J.B. Priestley and producer Andrew Marchant, and was directed by James Strong.

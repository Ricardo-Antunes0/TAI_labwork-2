The East Calcutta Wetlands, (22 0 27’N 88 0 08’E), is a mangrove swamp located in the north-western part of Kolkata, in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is a remnant of the once much larger tidal wetland complex that covered much of the east bank of the River Hooghly and its tributaries.  The wetlands are an important habitat for both wildfowl and aquatic birds. The wetland complex also supports a large population of nominate tern, common tern, black-headed gull, little cormorant, common moorhen and several species of snakes. The East Calcutta Wetlands are also an important source of aquatic plants, including floating heart Fern, Java moss and button weed.

Igloo House is a heritage-listed dwelling located at 65 Parriwi Road, Mosman in the Mosman Council local government area of New South Wales, Australia. It was designed by Harry Seidler and built from 1952 to 1953 by G. L. Williamson. It is also known as Williamson House. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 November 2002. History  The site was purchased by George Laurence Williamson, a solicitor who emigrated from Britain in the late 1940s. In 1951 he commissioned the design from the innovative architect, Harry Seidler. The innovative engineering design, utilising concrete slabs on piers, was undertaken by Peter Owen Miller. The house was built in 1952-1953 by Williamson as owner-builder using various tradesmen. Outfitting of the house appeared to continue for some time after this. Williamson sold the house in 1970 and subsequent owners have modified it since then, though retaining the basic structures.

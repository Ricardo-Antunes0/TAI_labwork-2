Wharncliffe Crags is a gritstone escarpment or edge situated approximately  north west of the city of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, England. It is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Overview  The edge, which is characterised as a steep rock face for much of its  length, runs from grid reference  just east of the village of Deepcar in a roughly southeasterly direction to grid reference  just east of Wharncliffe Side. Wharncliffe Crags stand on the eastern side of the upper River Don valley at around  above sea level, the highest spot height being . Although set in a pleasant situation, the northern end of the crags are never far away from the buzz of civilisation with the noise of the nearby Stocksbridge bypass and A6102 road ever-present; there are also two lines of electricity pylons, which converge at the northern end of the crags. The rocks of the escarpment were formed 320 million years ago in the Paleozoic era.

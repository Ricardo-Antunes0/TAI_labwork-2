The history of lighthouses refers to the development of lighthouse technology over the centuries. Lighthouses have been built all over the world to help sailors and pilots find their way at night.  The first known lighthouse was built in the Hellespont by the ancient Greeks. The first lighthouse was a small fire altar used to warn ships of the treacherous rocks near the river's mouth. The first lighthouse was destroyed by a storm in 358 BC.  The first lighthouse to be built with a permanent structure was the Pharos of Alexandria in Egypt. The Pharos of Alexandria was built in 331 BC and was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.  Lighthouses became increasingly important as navigation tools during the Middle Ages. Lighthouses were used to help sailors find their way in foggy conditions and during night time navigation.  During the early Renaissance, lighthouses were used as signal stations for ships crossing the Atlantic Ocean. Lighthouses were also used to help ships navigate through treacherous waters such as the Cape Verde Islands.  During the Victorian era, lighthouses became an important part of maritime safety and tourism. Lighthouses were used to warn ships of dangerous reefs and rocks and to provide navigational assistance during night time navigation.   Today, lighthouses continue to play an important role in maritime safety and tourism. Many lighthouses are now open to the public as tourist attractions.

Franz Gabriel Alexander (22 January 1891 – 9 February 1971) was an Austrian neurologist who made significant contributions to neuropathology, neurosurgery, and the study of brain function. He was also a pioneer in the development of neuroimaging techniques, and is credited with being the first to use X-rays to study the brain.  Born in Vienna, Austria, Franz Alexander was the son of a Jewish father and an Austrian Catholic mother. He studied medicine at University of Vienna and then moved to Berlin, Germany, where he worked as a neurologist at the Charité Hospital from 1917 until his retirement in 1957.

Franz Alexander was also a founding member of the International Brain Research Organization (IBRO), and served as its president from 1952 until his death in 1971.  Franz Alexander's work on the physiology and pathology of the brain was highly influential. His research on stroke led to improved treatments for patients, and his work on neurosurgery helped to improve patient outcomes. Franz Alexander's pioneering work in the use of X-rays to study the brain led to new understanding of brain function and disorders. He is also recognized for his work on mental illness, which included studies on schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Franz Alexander was awarded numerous honors throughout his life, including the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1950. He died in 1971 at the age of 85 years old.

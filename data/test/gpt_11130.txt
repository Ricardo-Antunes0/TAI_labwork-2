The Blu-ray Disc (BD), often known simply as Blu-ray, is a digital optical disc format. It was developed by the Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA), a group representing the major movie studios in the United States and Japan.  Blu-ray Disc players are able to play back discs which have been recorded in the BD format. BD-ROMs are not playable in standalone BD players. The first BD player, the BDP-S135, was released in October 2006. The BD format became available for consumer use in early 2007 with the launch of the Sony BDP-S790.

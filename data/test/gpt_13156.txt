Elizabeth M. Ward is an American scientist and mathematician who has made significant contributions to the understanding of dynamical systems, nonlinear dynamics, and chaos theory. She is also the current president of the American Mathematical Society.  Elizabeth M. Ward was born on September 18, 1962, in Cleveland, Ohio. She received her Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from Wheaton College in 1984. After graduation, she worked as a research mathematician at AT&T Bell Laboratories for two years. In 1986, she received her Doctor of Philosophy degree from Cornell University under the supervision of Jeffrey L. Ullman.  Ward's research focuses on dynamical systems and nonlinear dynamics. She has developed methods for studying the behavior of chaotic systems and has made significant contributions to our understanding of how these systems evolve over time. Her work has also had a significant impact on the design of algorithms for detecting and preventing chaos in computer systems.  Ward is currently the President of the American Mathematical Society and a Professor of Mathematical Sciences at Brown University. She has also been a visiting professor at several universities around the world, including Cambridge University, UC Berkeley, University of Pennsylvania, and Hebrew University Jerusalem.

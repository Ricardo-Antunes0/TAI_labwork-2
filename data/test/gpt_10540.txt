A post-detection policy (PDP), also known as a pre-emptive detection policy, is a security policy implemented by a computer system in anticipation of potential attacks.  The idea behind a PDP is to make the computer system aware of potential threats, and to take appropriate action in case of an attack. This might involve disabling or blocking certain programs, files, or websites, or it might involve raising the security level of the system.  PDPs can be useful in two ways. First, they can help to prevent attacks from happening in the first place. If the computer system is aware of potential threats before they actually happen, it can take steps to avoid them. Second, PDPs can help to protect the system against attacks that do happen. By taking action in advance, we can reduce the chances of damage being done to our computer system.

Open theism, also known as openness theology, is a theological perspective that stresses the openness of the Godhead and the need for faith to be open to all possible interpretations of scripture. Open theism originated in Protestant theology, but has since been adopted by a number of different religious traditions.  Open theism is not a single doctrine, but rather a way of thinking about theology that emphasizes the openness of God. Open theists believe that God is capable of revealing Himself in any way possible, and that all religious traditions are valid paths to understanding Him. This approach has led some open theists to argue that there is no one right interpretation of scripture, and that different people can arrive at different interpretations based on their individual backgrounds and beliefs.  Open theism has been controversial among some traditional Protestants, who argue that it undermines the authority of scripture. Others have argued that open theism allows for more flexibility and creativity in religious practice, and that it can lead to a more spiritual approach to life.

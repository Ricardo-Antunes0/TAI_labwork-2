His legal career is most remembered for his efforts in the area of water law, his key legal contributions being the "Kibbey Decision", a legal ruling establishing the principle that "water belongs to the land", and creation of the legal framework for the Salt River Valley Water User's Association, a model for federal water projects in the American West.  As governor, Kibbey was a leader in the effort to prevent Arizona and New Mexico territories from being combined into a single U.S. state. Early life Kibbey was born on March 4, 1853 in Centerville, Indiana to Caroline (Cunningham) and John F. Kibbey.  His father was an attorney who had been in a legal partnership with Indiana Governor Oliver P. Morton and served as Indiana Attorney General from March to November 1862.  After military service in the American Civil War, the elder Kibbey worked as a trial judge until 1885.  The younger Kibbey was educated in public schools before enrolling at Earlham College.

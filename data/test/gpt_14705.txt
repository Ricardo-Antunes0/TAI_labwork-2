In molecular biology, acetate kinase , which is also known as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of acetate to CO 2 and ATP. Acetate kinase is found mainly in aerobic organisms, where it plays an important role in the production of energy from glucose.  Acetate kinase is a key enzyme in the metabolism of glucose by aerobic organisms. Glucose is converted into pyruvate by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, and then into acetyl-CoA by acetate kinase. Acetate kinase then catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA into CO 2 and ATP. This reaction is important for the production of energy from glucose, and is carried out in the presence of oxygen.  Acetate kinase is found mainly in aerobic organisms, where it plays an important role in the production of energy from glucose. In these organisms, acetate kinase is located in the cytosol and is activated by pyruvate. The activity of acetate kinase can be regulated by a number of factors, including temperature and concentration of glucose.  Acetate kinase has several important roles in cellular metabolism. First, it catalyzes the conversion of glucose into pyruvate, which is then used to produce energy in cells. Second, acetate kinase helps to maintain cellular concentrations of pyruvate and oxygen. Third, acetate kinase helps to convert other

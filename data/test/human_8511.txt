OR 36 traverses the Mapleton–Junction City Highway No. 229 of the Oregon state highway system.  The entire route of the highway is located within Lane County. Route description The western terminus of Oregon Route 36 is a junction with Oregon Route 126 in Mapleton.

At the community of Swisshome it departs from the river, passing through the communities of Deadwood and Greenleaf, Triangle Lake, Blachly and Low Pass.  As it emerges from the mountains, it passes through the Alderwood State Wayside, and descends into the Willamette Valley.  It then passes through the communities of Goldson and Cheshire before ending just south of Junction City at an intersection with Oregon Route 99.

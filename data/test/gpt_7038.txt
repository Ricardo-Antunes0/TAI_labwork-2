Gallotia simonyi, also known as Simony's lizard, is a species of lizard in the family Iguanidae. It is endemic to Mexico, where it is known from the state of Chiapas.  Gallotia simonyi is a medium-sized lizard with a smooth, scaly skin. The dorsal side is olive-brown, while the underbelly is whitish. The body is topped with a triangular yellowish-green crest. Juveniles have a black stripe down the middle of their backs. Adults have a wider yellow stripe on their neck, and some yellow on their limbs.  Gallotia simonyi is endemic to the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range in Chiapas, Mexico. Its range extends from the upper reaches of the Usumacinta River to an altitude of 1,800 meters (5,900 ft). The highest concentration of this species can be found in the Cerros de los Tuxtlas National Park.  Gallotia simonyi is a threatened species due to habitat loss and persecution from humans for its skin and meat. It occurs in primary rainforest and cloud forest habitats, but due to logging, agriculture, and road construction, it has been displaced from many areas within its range.

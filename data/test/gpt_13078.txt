The Monmouth Viaduct or Chippenham Meadow Viaduct is a railway bridge over the River Monnow in Monmouthshire, Wales. It is considered to be one of the most important engineering achievements in the history of the British railway system, and is a Grade I listed building.  The viaduct was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and built between 1836 and 1842. It is 287 metres long, has a main span of 116 metres and is composed of ten stone arches linked by a series of vaults. The viaduct carries the line from Chepstow to Monmouth over the River Monnow, and was one of the first major railway bridges in Britain to use wrought iron rather than stone arches.  The viaduct has been subject to several disasters, including a severe flood in 1875 that damaged many of the arches, and a fire in 1987 that destroyed much of the roof. Despite these incidents, the viaduct remains in use today and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Wales.

Robert Arliegh Nixon (June 25, 1900 – April 22, 1994) was an American politician who served as the 37th President of the United States from 1969 to 1974. A Republican, he was the only U.S. president to resign from office.  Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, California, to Hannah Nixon (née Hannah Milhous) and Alexander Nixon. His father was a successful glove manufacturer and his mother was a homemaker. After graduating from Whittier High School in 1917, Nixon enrolled at Whittier College, but he dropped out after two years to enlist in the U.S. Army during World War I. He served briefly as a private and then as a first lieutenant before being discharged in 1919.  Nixon then attended law school and became an assistant prosecutor in Orange County, California. He served two terms as the county's Republican Party chairman (1939–1941), and then entered politics. In 1942, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he served for four years (1943–1949). He became Vice President of the United States in 1953 under Eisenhower, and in 1961 was elected President following Eisenhower's resignation due to poor health.  In 1968, Nixon won re-election by a landslide over Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey. In 1973, Nixon faced impeachment after it was discovered that he had ordered his Attorney General, John Mitchell, to bug Democratic offices during the Watergate scandal. The Senate voted 97–0 to convict him

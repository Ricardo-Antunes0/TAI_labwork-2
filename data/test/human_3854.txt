John Glover Stone (November 16, 1876 â€“ January 16, 1934) was a boat builder, merchant and politician in Newfoundland. He represented Trinity from 1913 to 1919 and Trinity North from 1932 to 1934 in the Newfoundland House of Assembly. Biography  The son of Thomas Stone and Lenora Guy, he was born in Catalina on November 16, 1876. After his father's death in 1891, Stone and his brother Thomas continued to operate the family fishery supply business. He spent several years working in the United States during the early 1900s. He later returned to Catalina and joined the Fishermen's Protective Union (FPU) in 1910. In 1911, he was named manager of the Union Trading Company store in Catalina. A few years later, Stone had become inspector for all the company's branch stores. He served as Minister of Marine and Fisheries from 1917 to 1919. Because he joined the cabinet of Michael Cashin in 1919, he was considered a traitor by the FPU and was defeated when he ran for reelection in 1919 and 1923.

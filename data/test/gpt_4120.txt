He made his first-team debut for Celtic in November 1907, and later that season scored on his league debut in a 2–1 victory over Dumbarton. Kellock spent six seasons with Celtic, helping the club to win two Scottish League Championships and two Scottish Cups. He also played for Preston North End in England before moving to Airdrieonians in 1924. He retired from playing in 1936, after playing for Rangers.

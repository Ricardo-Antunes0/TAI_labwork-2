Robert W. Monk (March 28, 1866 â€“ July 19, 1916) was an American psychologist and one of the founders of the field of Experimental Psychology. He is also credited with coining the term "mental fatigue" in 1908.  Monk was born in Brooklyn, New York to parents who were physicians. After graduating from Yale College in 1888, he studied at the University of Berlin and then at the University of Leipzig where he received his doctorate in 1892. He then returned to the United States and began teaching at Johns Hopkins University, where he remained for the remainder of his career.  In 1908, Monk published a paper entitled "Mental Fatigue as a Result of Mental Work" in which he first coined the term "mental fatigue." This paper is considered to be one of the foundational works in experimental psychology and is often cited as an example of how experimentation can be used to explore psychological phenomena. Monk also made significant contributions to the study of attention, memory, learning, and problem solving. He died from pneumonia in 1916.

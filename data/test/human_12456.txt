Chadderton Town Hall is a municipal building on Middleton Road, Chadderton, Greater Manchester, England. The town hall, which was the headquarters of Chadderton Urban District Council, is a grade II listed building. History After a local board of health was established in Chadderton in 1873 and the Chadderton Lyceum then got into financial difficulties the following year, the board of health acquired the Lyceum's premises at the corner of Middleton Road and Melbourne Street and converted the building into Chadderton's first town hall. A young boy was killed, the main hall damaged and the offices on the floor below destroyed when a gas lantern exploded in the town hall in February 1884. The town became an urban district in 1894 and, in the early 20th century, the new civic leaders decided to vacate the old town hall and procure a purpose-built facility: the site selected between Victoria Street and Garforth Street had been occupied by a terrace of four private properties.

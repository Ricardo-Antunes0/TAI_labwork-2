Judith of Flanders ( 843 â€“ c. 912) was a medieval French noblewoman and Christian saint. She is venerated as a heroine of the Catholic Church.  Judith was born into a wealthy and powerful family in the Flemish region of Belgium in the late eighth century. She married an older man, with whom she had two children. However, her husband died sometime before 893, leaving Judith widowed and with two young children.  Judith soon became a devout Christian, and commenced a life of prayer and fasting. She also began to provide assistance to the poor and needy, and eventually became known as "the patron saint of Belgium". In 902, she was arrested by the local pagan king for her faith, but was miraculously saved from execution by divine intervention.  After her release, Judith traveled throughout Germany and Italy preaching the Gospel. She died in Rome in 912, possibly from pneumonia. Her remains were returned to Belgium and interred in the Abbey of Notre Dame de Harelbeke.  Judith is venerated as a heroine of the Catholic Church and her feast day is celebrated on October 13th.

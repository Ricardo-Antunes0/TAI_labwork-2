The Illegitimates is a six-issue, 2013 American espionage comic book miniseries created by actor/comedian Taran Killam, written by Killam and comic book writer/novelist Marc Andreyko, illustrated by Kevin Sharpe, and featuring a first issue cover by Jerry Ordway. It is published by IDW Publishing, and premiered on December 18, 2013. The book focuses on a team of illegitimate siblings who are charged with taking the place of their father, Jack Steele, a James Bond-like superspy, after his death. Publication history The Illegitimates was conceived by actor/comedian Taran Killam, who first became interested in comics through the 1991 book X-Men #1, which was illustrated by Jim Lee. Killam also is an avid fan of the James Bond franchise, naming On Her Majesty's Secret Service and the Nintendo 64 game Goldeneye as memorable aspects of his college experiences, and Sean Connery, Goldfinger and Skyfall as his favorite Bond actor, film and theme, respectively. Killam was inspired by the observation that the amount of unprotected sex that a superspy like James Bond would have would produce many children, which provides an unusual permutation to the mythology of the Bond Girl. In this way, Bond is more of a springboard to the book's premise rather than a recurring motif, and Killam stresses that the series core concept is entirely distinct from Bond.

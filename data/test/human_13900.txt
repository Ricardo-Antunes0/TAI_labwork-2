Joseph M. Mosher (1888â€“1967) was an American architect practicing in Rhode Island during the mid-20th century. He designed many churches and schools around southern New England, after being associated with the office of Walter F. Fontaine for many years. Life Much of Joseph Marshall Mosher's life is unknown, with him first appearing circa 1921 as an architect in the office of Woonsocket architect Walter Fontaine, a major ecclesiastical architect. At that time he was noted as an alum and instructor in architecture at the Rhode Island School of Design. He remained with the Fontaine firm and its successors until about 1946, when he established his own office in Providence. During the early 1950s he took his son, Joseph Mosher, Jr., into the firm, which became Joseph M. Mosher & Son. There may have been a second son involved as well. Mosher retired from the firm circa 1960. He died in 1967.

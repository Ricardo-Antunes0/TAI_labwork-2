The album produced three singles: "Countdown to Extinction", "Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?", and "Train of Consequences". All three reached the top 5 in the US charts. The album has since been certified platinum by the RIAA.  "Cameosis" was well received by critics. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine awarded it four out of five stars, calling it "a triumph of speed, power and technicality." He also praised Drover's drumming and Mustaine's vocals.

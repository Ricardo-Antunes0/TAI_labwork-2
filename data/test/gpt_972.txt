Muse began work on their fourth studio album in early 2008, shortly after the release of their third album "Black Holes and Revelations". The band worked with several producers during the recording process, including Nigel Godrich, who co-wrote seven of the album's fourteen tracks and served as the band's primary collaborator. The band toured in support of "Black Holes and Revelations" throughout 2008 and early 2009, before beginning work on "Escape from Noise" in May 2009.  "Escape from Noise" has a more electronic sound than previous Muse albums, with influences from dubstep and IDM. The album's lyrical content is also more introspective than previous work; frontman Matt Bellamy has said that it is his "most personal record".  "Escape from Noise" was released on 6 September 2009 by EMI.

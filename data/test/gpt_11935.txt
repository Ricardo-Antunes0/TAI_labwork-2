The Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction, or TIMI, is a scoring system for the assessment of the risk of death after an MI. Originally developed by the International Society of Cardiology, TIMI has been adopted by many organizations as a standard measure of prognosis in cardiac patients.  TIMI is a scoring system that uses four variables to measure the risk of death in cardiac patients. The variables are: 1. Initial TIMI score  2. In-hospital death  3. Revascularization (coronary angioplasty or stenting)  4. All-cause mortality.  The score ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a higher risk of death. The original TIMI score was based on the following four variables: 1. Initial TIMI score  2. In-hospital death  3. Revascularization (coronary angioplasty or stenting)  4. All-cause mortality.

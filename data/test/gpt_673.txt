Bernard Ernest Witkin (May 22, 1904 â€“ December 6, 1988) was an American-born, naturalized British artist who specialized in landscape painting. Witkin is considered to be one of the most important 20th century landscape painters. He is known for his lush and painterly landscapes of Britain and Ireland, as well as for his abstract oil paintings.  Bernard Witkin was born on May 22, 1904, in New York City to Russian-Jewish immigrant parents. He studied art at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and then at the Academie Julian in Paris. In 1928 he moved to London and began working as a illustrator for magazines such as LIFE and Picture Post. In 1934 he became a full-time painter, and soon became known for his lush and painterly landscapes of Britain and Ireland.  Witkin's abstract oil paintings were controversial when first exhibited in the early 1960s, but his later work has been more widely acclaimed. He died on December 6, 1988, in Dorking, England.

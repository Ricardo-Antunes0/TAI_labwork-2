Santos Juanes or Sant Joan del Mercat is a Roman Catholic church located in the Mercat neighborhood of the city of Valencia, Spain. The church is also denominated the Real Parroquia de los Santos Juanes (Royal Parish of the St Johns) or San Juan del Mercado (Sant Joan del Mercat in Valencian or St John of the Market) due to its location adjacent to the city Central Market and facing the Llotja de la Seda building.  By the mid-13th century, a church was built atop the site of a former mosque, initially in a Gothic style; however fires in the 14th-century caused reconstruction. A major fire in 1592 led to a reconstruction, commissioned by the Archbishop and Viceroy Juan de Ribera in an exuberant Baroque style completed in the year 1700. This was located in the Boatella neighborhood, then working class quarters, outside the town walls, that housed some of the Morisco population.

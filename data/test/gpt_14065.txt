Soil  chemistry is the study of the chemical properties of soils, including the interaction of soil components and the environment. Soil chemistry is a multidisciplinary field that draws on physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering.  Soil is composed of a variety of materials, including soil particle size, organic matter content, and clay content. Soil also contains minerals, such as quartz, feldspar, mica, and potassium. The various substances in soil interact with each other to create a complex mixture that affects plant growth and the environment.  Soil chemistry is used to understand why soils differ in their ability to support plant growth and to manage environmental conditions. It is also used to create soil treatments that improve plant productivity or protect the environment.

Pope Clement IV (;  23 November 1294 – 14 May 1352) was the fourth and final pope of the Catholic Church during the Middle Ages. He succeeded Pope Gregory X on 18 February 1314, and reigned for just over seven years, until his death in 1352. Clement IV was the only Avignon pope to be elected by acclamation.  Clement was born in Anagni, Italy in 1294. He initially studied in Paris, where he became a master of theology. In 1305 he began his ecclesiastical career as a canon of the cathedral of Anagni. He then served as the Bishop of Sabina (1309–1314), and as the Archbishop of Ravenna (1316–1324).  Pope Gregory X appointed him as Bishop of Ostia e Velletri (1324–1332), and then as Archbishop of Capitolium (1332–1342). On 18 February 1314, Clement was elected to succeed Gregory X as Pope. Clement's papacy was marked by struggles with King John II of France over taxation and with Prince Edward, the future King Edward III of England over the rights to Aquitaine.  Clement died in Rome on 14 May 1352 at the age of 70 after a long and debilitating illness. He is buried in St Peter's Basilica.

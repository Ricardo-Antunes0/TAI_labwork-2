The Rose Bowl Game is an annual American college football bowl game played on New Year's Day in Pasadena, California. The Rose Bowl Game is part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I FBS football schedule.  The Rose Bowl Game is one of the oldest and most prestigious bowl games in the United States.   The inaugural Rose Bowl Game was played on January 1, 1902, and featured Fielding H. Yost's Michigan Wolverines and Frank J. Leahy's Stanford Indians. The Rose Bowl has been played annually since then, with the exception of 1943 (due to World War II). Through the 2018 season, it has been played 118 times, with the Michigan Wolverines leading the all-time series 60–35–5.  Since 1931, the game has been televised in the United States by either ABC or ESPN. In 2002, ESPN assumed exclusive television rights to the Rose Bowl Game.  The game is currently sponsored by Vizio and officially known as the Vizio Rose Bowl Game presented by Northwestern Mutual.

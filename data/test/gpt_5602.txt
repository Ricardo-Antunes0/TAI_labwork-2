Queen's Park is an urban park in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The park is bounded by Bloor Street to the north, Lake Ontario to the east, Sherbourne Street to the south and Parliament Street to the west.   The park was designated a Toronto Park in 1853 and named for Queen Victoria. It was initially a small rural parcel of land on the banks of the Don River that was acquired by the city in 1853 for use as a public park. The current area of Queen's Park was acquired in 1876 and 1877 from John Graves Simcoe and Daniel Robertson. The first major addition to the park occurred in 1894 with the construction of the Ontario Memorial Arch which commemorates those who fought in both World Wars. In 1912, a children's playground was constructed on the site of what is now known as Centre Island. In 1919, a bandstand was erected at Sunnyside Gardens. In 1932, a war memorial designed by George Stanley was erected at Allan Gardens. In 1951, an ice rink was constructed at Allan Gardens.   Queen's Park is home to many attractions including an outdoor pool, tennis courts, a golf course, a skateboard park and a children's play area. The park is also home to two museums: the Royal Ontario Museum and the Canadian War Museum. The Queens Park Cenotaph is also located within the park.

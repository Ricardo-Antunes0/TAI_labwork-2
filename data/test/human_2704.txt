"Mutt" is a song by American rock band Blink-182 from the band's third studio album, Enema of the State (1999). It was written primarily by guitarist Tom DeLonge, with additional songwriting credit to bassist Mark Hoppus, and drummer Scott Raynor. The song's narrative portrays a lustful couple. DeLonge penned the track for his friend, the professional surfer Benji Weatherly. The band first recorded the song for Weatherly's appearance in the 1998 surf film The Show, prior to Raynor's exit from the group. The song was later re-recorded with drummer Travis Barker and included on the band's 1999 album, Enema of the State. This edition had a prominent placement on the soundtrack for the 1999 film American Pie; the song plays during a memorable scene in which the main character attempts to woo a foreign exchange student. A 2016 Rolling Stone reader's poll ranked "Mutt" among the trio's fans' favorite tunes.

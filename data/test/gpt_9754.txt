The Romaniote Jews or the Romaniotes (, "Romaniotes") are a group of Sephardic Jews who trace their ancestry to the Iberian Peninsula and the Romani people. The Romaniote Jews form the largest and most internationally dispersed Sephardic Jewish community.  The Romaniote Jews are descended from the medieval Jewish communities of Iberia, which were forcibly converted to Christianity in the 6th century AD. After the Reconquista, most of these communities were expelled from Spain and Portugal in 1492 and 1536, respectively. They settled in various parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, where they formed a significant and influential minority.  The Romaniote Jews are mostly concentrated in France, Italy, Turkey, Israel, and the United States. There are also significant numbers in Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile.

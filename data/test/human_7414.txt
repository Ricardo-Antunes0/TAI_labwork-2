White Spirit were  an English heavy metal band from Hartlepool, England, best remembered for guitarist Janick Gers who went on to play with Ian Gillan, Bruce Dickinson, and ultimately, Iron Maiden. Other members of the band were Bruce Ruff (vocals), Malcolm Pearson (keyboards), Phil Brady (bass), and Graeme Crallan (drums). History White Spirit, co-founded by Gers and Crallan in 1975, are considered part of the new wave of British heavy metal, although their sound was closer to that of 1970s hard rock acts such as Deep Purple or Uriah Heep. The band issued their debut single, "Backs to the Grind", on the fledgling heavy metal independent label Neat Records in 1980. It was backed with "Cheetah", which would also appear on Neat's Lead Weight compilation (and again on the retrospective New Wave of British Heavy Metal '79 Revisited double LP/CD in 1990, compiled by noted NWOBHM enthusiast Lars Ulrich of Metallica and former Kerrang! editor Geoff Barton). White Spirit featured on various other notable NWOBHM compilations such as Volume 2 of Metal for Muthas, the Muthas Pride EP, Brute Force, and 60 Minutes Plus.

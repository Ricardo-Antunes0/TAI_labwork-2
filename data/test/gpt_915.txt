The tricorne or tricorn is a style of hat, typically worn in the 17th and 18th centuries by Frenchmen, British subjects, and members of the Royal Household.  The tricorne was originally a military hat, developed in the late 16th century as a protective headwear for field officers. It was not until the 18th century that it began to be worn as a popular hat by civilians. The tricorne is a triangular shaped hat made of felt or cloth, with a pointed front and a curved brim. It was originally black but later became various colors, including blue, green, and yellow.

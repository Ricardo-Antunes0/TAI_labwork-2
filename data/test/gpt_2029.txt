Most people use computers to do their everyday tasks, but for people with disabilities, it can be difficult to use them because they cannot physically reach the keyboard or mouse. CapturaTalk is a small device that attaches to a user's screen and captures whatever they are looking at. The device then sends the image to a computer, where it can be saved and shared with others.  CapturaTalk has been used by people with a variety of disabilities, including cerebral palsy, quadriplegia, and blindness. It has been found to be especially helpful for people who have difficulty speaking or writing. By capturing what they see on their screens, they can easily communicate what they are looking at to others.   CapturaTalk is available for purchase online or through various disability-related organizations. It is also available as part of the Apple iPad app store.

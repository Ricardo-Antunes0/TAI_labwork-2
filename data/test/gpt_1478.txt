The Rodrigues starling (Necropsar rodericanus) is an Old World starling found on the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. The Rodrigues starling is the smallest starling and has the widest range of any bird. It is a common resident on Rodrigues and its surrounding islands, though it is also found on RÃ©union and other nearby islands.  The Rodrigues starling is a small, compact bird with a long tail and slender body. It is mainly black, but has a chestnut patch on its breast and a white band around the neck. The Rodrigues starling feeds mainly on insects, but also eats fruit and seeds. It nests in tree cavities or among rocks, and lays two eggs.

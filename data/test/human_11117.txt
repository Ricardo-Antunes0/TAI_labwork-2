Siegessäule is Berlin's most widely distributed queer magazine and has been published monthly, except for two brief hiatuses, since April 1984. Originally only available in West Berlin, it ran with the subtitle "Berlin's monthly page for Gays". In 1996, it was broadened to include lesbian content, and in 2005 it was expanded to reach a wider queer target base, becoming the only magazine of its scale in Europe to represent the full spectrum of the LGBT community. The magazine is available for free at around 700 locations in Berlin, printing 53.688 copies per month (verified third quarter 2016). Since March-issue 2013, it has been overseen by chief editor Jan Noll. History On February 29, 1984, the idea for a gay city magazine came up on the protocol of a meeting of gay groups in Berlin at the Prinz Eisenherz bookstore on Bülowstraße, and the magazine's first official meeting took place at the gay nightclub  on Kulmer Straße. The first edition was published by "Freunde der Siegessäule e.V.", released in April in a run of 1,000 copies, containing 16 pages, for the price of one Deutsche Mark. The name was not easily agreed upon, with Siegessäule finally chosen in reference to the Berliner memorial, the Victory Column.

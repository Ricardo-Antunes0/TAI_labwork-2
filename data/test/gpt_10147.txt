Rodney's Stone is a two-metre high Pictish stone, located near the village of Langholm, Dumfries and Galloway, in southern Scotland. The stone is thought to date from the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age and may once have been a burial monument.  The stone is carved with a series of interlocking circles, which some have interpreted as a form of Celtic art. The stone was first noted by the English antiquarian John Thomson in 1773 and was acquired by the British Museum in 1816. It has been described as one of Scotland's most famous archaeological sites.

Primrose Hill is a district in the North London Borough of Camden. It is bounded by Regent's Park to the south and east, Hampstead Heath to the north and west, and Highgate to the southwest. The area now constituting the district was initially part of the large Manor of Primrosehill, held by the le Despencer family from the 12th century.  The area now comprising Primrose Hill was originally rural, with scattered farms and hamlets. In the late 18th century, it began to be developed as a fashionable residential district, and many of its famous residents – including the poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge and painter J.M.W. Turner – were born or lived in the area during its heyday. Today, Primrose Hill remains one of London's most prestigious addresses, with a large concentration of luxury apartments, boutiques, and restaurants.  Primrose Hill is served by two tube stations on the Northern Line: Highgate (0.9 miles) and Primrose Hill (1.1 miles). It is also served by Camden Town tube station on lines 1 and 2 of London's Underground network.

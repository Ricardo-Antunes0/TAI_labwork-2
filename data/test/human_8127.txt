The  is a Japanese Shinkansen high-speed train with tilting capability operated by JR Central and JR West on the Tokaido and San'y≈ç Shinkansen lines since 2020, and also planned to be operated by JR Kyushu on the Nagasaki Shinkansen line. History In June 2016, JR Central announced plans to build a new prototype "N700S" 16-car trainset (with "S" standing for "Supreme") for evaluating new technology and features on the Tokaido and Sanyo Shinkansen lines from March 2018. Developed from the earlier N700 series design, the new train will incorporate a number of new features. Refinements to the ATC and braking systems will enable shorter braking distances in emergencies such as earthquakes. Optimized underfloor equipment layout will allow the same standard design to be used to easily produce 12, 8 and 6-car trainsets in addition to the Tokaido Shinkansen 16-car trainsets. The optimization is intended to make the train more flexible for possible export. The optimization further allows Toshiba SCiB LTO batteries to be installed so that the train can operate at low speed in the event of a disruption to overhead power. Green cars will use active suspension to further improve ride quality, and ordinary-class cars will have AC power outlets for each seat.

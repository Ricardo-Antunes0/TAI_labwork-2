Civitella Casanova is an Italian town of inland mountain of 1,950 inhabitants in the province of Pescara in Abruzzo and belongs to the mountain community Vestina. Listed on the National Park of Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga (in the District of Great Abbeys, which is home) and the Regional Reserve Voltigno and Valle d'Angri, a regional reserve included in the National Park, the country bases its economy mainly on agriculture. It has pre-Roman origins of repute, the sources of the historian Livy emerges as the town of Civitella was called Cutina or Cingilia (no one knows if it was anciently called Cutina then changing the name in Cingilia, or if the old part of town today said Terravecchia, had the name Cutina and the rest of the country in Cingilia, or if the two toponyms were equal). Civitella Casanova is considered the home of arrosticini, to attest this is notified that in the town hall are the first licenses for the sale of arrosticini dating back to 1819, not owned by closely neighboring municipalities, the province of Pescara or other surrounding provinces. Civitella is defined as "the country that invented the arrosticini".

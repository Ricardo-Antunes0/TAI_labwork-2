Topological polymers may refer to a polymeric material that has a topological feature, such as a knot or a hole. Topological polymers are also characterized by their low entanglement entropy, which makes them unusual materials for many applications in physics and engineering.  Topological polymers are materials with unusual physical and chemical properties. They can be characterised by their low entanglement entropy, which makes them unusual materials for many applications in physics and engineering. For example, topological polymers can be used as spin filters, sensors, and lubricants.

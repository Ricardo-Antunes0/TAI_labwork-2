The Manor of Worksop is a feudal entity in the Dukeries area of Nottinghamshire, England. Held in Grand Serjeanty by a lord of the manor, it was originally connected with nearby Worksop Manor, a stately home. History Under the feudal system in late and high medieval England, tenure by serjeanty was a form of land-holding in return for some specified service, usually the discharge of duties in the household of the king or other high-ranking noble. Allegedly created to commemorate the Danegeld (c.1163), it is said that the Worksop serjeanty was already known in the time of King Alfred if not earlier. In 1327 tenure was passed to Worksop Manor from Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire. In 1541 Worksop Manor was held by George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, before passing to the Dukes of Norfolk, in whose family it remained until 1840. The estate was then sold to the Dukes of Newcastle of nearby Clumber Park who owned it until the 20th century. The land and the lordship then passed to corporate owners. In 1994 the title was bought by John Hunt (died 2016), a retired transport manager of Worksop, for a reported Â£40,000.

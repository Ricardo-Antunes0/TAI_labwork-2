The Aral Sea  was an endorheic lake in Central Asia, the largest of its type in the world and the fourth-largest lake by area. It was located in present-day Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, between the Ural and Tian Shan mountain ranges.  The Aral Sea basin was formed about 25 million years ago as a result of the collision of the Eurasian and African plates. The eastern basin was gradually filled with water from rivers flowing from the mountains, while the western basin remained dry. The Aral Sea formed when a large inland water reservoir, formed by the accumulation of snow and ice on the mountains, burst its banks.  The Aral Sea was one of the most important lakes in terms of fisheries and was also an important region for trade. Throughout the 20th century, it became increasingly polluted because of industrial development and agricultural runoff. In 1989, it was declared an international disaster because of its severe environmental damage. In 2002, it was filled with water and became part of the new Aral Sea Lake.

In economics, personal income refers to an individual's total income from all sources during a given period. It is distinguished from gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period.  There are several ways to measure personal income. The most common method is to calculate gross income, which includes salaries, wages, tips, commissions, bonuses, and other forms of income from work. Other methods include adjusted gross income (AGI) and net income.  Personal income can be broken down into four main categories: wages and salaries, benefits, capital gains, and other sources of income. Wages and salaries are the largest component of personal income, accounting for almost two-thirds of all personal income in the United States. Benefits make up the remaining one-third.  Personal income varies greatly across different countries and over time. In 2018, the top 25 countries with the highest personal incomes were all in Europe. The United States ranked 20th with a median personal income of $60,528. The country with the lowest median personal income was Niger at $1,025."

The ManawatÅ« River is a major river in the North Island of New Zealand. It flows southeast from the peaks of the Southern Alps and flows through the city of Napier before emptying into the Tasman Sea at Hastings. The river is known for its huge estuarine tidal range, which makes it a popular place for swimming, fishing, and boating.

Downright Dencey is a 1927 children's historical novel by Caroline Dale Snedeker. The novel, illustrated by Maginel Wright Barney, was first published in 1927 and was a Newbery Honor recipient in 1928. Plot The story is set in Nantucket, Massachusetts shortly after the War of 1812, and deals with the unlikely friendship between a Quaker girl, Dencey Coffyn, and Jetsam, the adopted son of the town drunk. Their friendship was formed when Dencey sought his forgiveness for hurting him with a stone. In exchange for his forgiveness, she taught him to read and they became even closer which was met with disapproval by her mother. The reason for this  was because Jetsam was a socially outcast boy who displayed characteristics not in keeping with Quakerism. However, Dencey refused to part ways with Jetsam leading her mother to banish her to her room with only bread and water as punishment. Nevertheless, the friendship grew even stronger to the point where Jetsam saved Dencey's life from a deadly storm. She was trapped in it while attempting to save him from accepting a job with the horrible Professor Snubshoe. Afterwards, he gained favor with Dencey's family who adopted him and helped him to transform into an admirable young man. As Dencey and Jetsam grew closer and older, they developed romantic feelings for each other. Finally, Jetsam asked Dencey to marry him.<ref>The Newbery Companion by John Thomas Gillespie and Corinne J. Naden, p.29â€“30</ref>

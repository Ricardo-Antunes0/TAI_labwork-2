Bessie Clayton (c. 1875 – July 16, 1948) was an American Broadway, vaudeville and burlesque specialty dancer and choreographer whose near 35-year career began in the era popularly known as the Gay Nineties. Clayton was remembered for her whirlwind style of dance often performed while descending a long flight of stairs. She is considered to be the matriarch of American toe-tap dancing, and the melding of stage dancing and classical ballet. In her obituary, The New York Times called Clayton America’s first native-born prima ballerina. Biography The daughter of Irish Immigrants, Bessie Clayton was born in Philadelphia where she received her early instruction from the ballet master, George Washington Smith (1820–1899). She first performed on stage at around the age of eight and with help of a fellow Philadelphian, composer and manager Alfred E. Aarons, made her professional debut some eight years later in Charles Hoyt’s long-running hit  musical, A Trip to Chinatown staged at New York’s Madison Square Theatre. Reportedly Clayton was hired as a temporary one night fill-in after dancer Loie Fuller abruptly left the cast of  A Trip to Chinatown. The diminutive dancer (5’1” as an adult) so impressed Hoyt’s company they employed her for the following six seasons.

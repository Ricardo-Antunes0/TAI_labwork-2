Frank Valeriote (born August 15, 1954) is a Canadian politician. He was elected as the Liberal Member of Parliament in 2008 by a small margin over the Conservative candidate Gloria Kovach and subsequently served as MP until October 2015. Valeriote chose not to run in the 2015 federal election. In an interview with the Guelph Mercury newspaper in November 2014, he cited a desire to spend more time with his two young children. "I feel it is important in a meaningful way to be there for their millionth step as they enter their teenage years as it was to see their first step." In a later interview, he confirmed his plan to return to legal practice, "I'm physically, emotionally, and psychologically preparing for the move from member of parliament to an active lawyer at Smith Valeriote." On October 26, 2015, SmithValeriote Law Firm LLP welcomed Frank Valeriote back to the practice where he had been a senior partner until his election as a Member of Parliament. Background

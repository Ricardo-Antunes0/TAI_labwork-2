Also known as The pogroms of 1391, the Massacre of 1391 was a display of antisemitism and violence against Jews in Spain. It was one of the Middle Ages' largest attacks on Jews, who were ultimately given the choice of converting or leaving Spain in 1492. While Jews in the Iberian Peninsula at this time were generally disliked, violence against Jews was common even until the 15th century. However, 1391 marked a peak in the violence against Jews. Attitudes toward Jews in the 1300s  In the years leading up to the Massacre of 1391, Jews were not particularly liked by the Catholic church because they were believed to have crucified the Christ. However, there was tolerance as they were under the protection of Spain and had crucial roles in banking and finance that made them a financial asset. In the early fourteenth century (1311–12) the general council of Vienne met and decided to censor the Moors' religious freedoms, and some would claim that the general council became aware of what their neighbors thought of their tolerance of Jews, and therefore returned to Spain with a newfound goal to damage the peaceful tolerance among  Jews, Moors, and larger Spanish population. However, while it is likely that this inspired ill feelings towards Jews, there was no drastic result because of the current tax on the Jewish people which contributed greatly to the kingdom and the church. Thus, Jews were too much of an economic asset to be violently discriminated against.

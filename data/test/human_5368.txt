Finelines is the debut studio album by the British rock band My Vitriol. It was released on 5 March 2001 through Infectious Records. Initially consisting of a duo, My Vitriol released their debut EP Delusions of Grandeur (1998), before expanding to a four-piece. They signed to Infectious Records in December 1999, and began recording their debut album at Linford Manor, near Milton Keynes, with Chris Sheldon, and frontman Som Wardner co-producing. Described as an alternative rock album, Finelines was compared to acts such as the Smashing Pumpkins, My Bloody Valentine, and Foo Fighters. Between early 2000 and early 2001, My Vitriol released four singles – "Losing Touch", "Cemented Shoes", "Pieces", and "Always: Your Way" – prior to the release of Finelines. Fifth single "Grounded" appeared in May 2001, which was followed by support slots for the likes of Feeder, Ash, and Placebo. My Vitriol went on a headlining tour of the United Kingdom at the end of 2001, and followed it with a series of shows in the United States in early 2002. A remixed version of the album was released in July 2002, combined with the B-sides compilation Between the Lines.

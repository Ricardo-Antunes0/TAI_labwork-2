Panic Attack is an EP released by American rock band Blink-182 in 2002. The EP was released exclusively through the band's website, and consists of six tracks, all of which were later featured on the group's first studio album, Enema of the State (1999).  The EP was recorded at the same time as Blink-182's debut album, but was not released until two years later due to the delay in record companies' approval of the band. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its catchiness but criticized its lack of originality. It has since been regarded as a transitional EP between the band's early punk rock sound and their more pop-oriented style on Enema of the State.

The Pennsylvania Railroad's MP54 was a class of 4-6-0 steam locomotives built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1881.  The MP54 was a moderate-sized locomotive for its time, and was popular with railroads for its efficient operation and good fuel economy. The locomotives proved to be reliable and lasted for many years on the railroads.  The MP54 was designed by George Hickory of the Baldwin Locomotive Works, and was based on the earlier 4-4-0 locomotives. The MP54 had a 2-8-0 wheel arrangement, and was powered by a single coal or oil-fired boiler. The locomotives were popular for their fast operation on long distances, and were used on routes across the United States and in Canada.

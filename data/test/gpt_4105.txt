Theodore Minet Haultain (27 May 1817 – 1 October 1895) was a French composer and pianist.  Born in Paris, Haultain studied at the Paris Conservatory with François-Joseph Fétis. He won first prize in piano at the age of 18. His early works were mostly chamber music and songs, but he soon began to compose operas. His most successful opera, La Juive (1867), was based on the novel of the same name by Émile Zola. He also wrote two successful operettas, L'Arlésienne (1867) and Le roi l'a dit (1875). Haultain later turned to orchestral music, writing a number of symphonies, concertos, and other works.  Haultain died in Paris at the age of 81.

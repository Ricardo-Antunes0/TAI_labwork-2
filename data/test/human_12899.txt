Ray Clark Washburn (born May 31, 1938) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals from 1961 to 1969 and the Cincinnati Reds in 1970. Baseball career Washburn was born in Pasco, Washington and was a  1961 graduate of Whitworth University. Washburn, a $50,000 "bonus baby,"  went 12â€“9 with the Cardinals as a rookie in 1962. A shoulder muscle tear midway into the 1963 season sidelined him for the remainder of the year and limited his effectiveness for the next two years afterwards. Relying mostly on a curveball, Washburn returned to the starting rotation in 1966, winning 11 games against 9 losses; in 1967, he won 10 games against 7 losses on a Cardinal team that won the World Series, defeating the Boston Red Sox in seven games. He had missed nearly a month of action that season after his thumb was dislocated by a Johnny Roseboro line drive single on June 21.

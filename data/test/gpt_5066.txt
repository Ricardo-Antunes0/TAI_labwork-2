Wayang style is a style of puppetry, originated in the Javanese region of Indonesia. It is often considered the most comprehensive and refined form of puppetry, and has been influential in the development of modern Indonesian theatre.  Wayang style was first developed in the 9th century by Javanese court artists, who made use of carved wooden figures, masks, and props to tell stories. The puppeteers manipulated the figures using hand gestures and facial expressions, creating a live performance that was often accompanied by music and dance. This unique form of storytelling quickly gained popularity among Javanese audiences, who appreciated its intricate visual and auditory effects.  Over the years, Wayang style has evolved into a highly stylized form of puppetry. Puppeteers still use wooden figures and masks, but they are intricately carved and painted with elaborate details. They are also equipped with strings that allow them to move their characters in a variety of ways, including walking, dancing, and even flying.  Today, Wayang style is still very popular in Indonesia. Many museums across the country have collections of Wayang puppets, and annual festivals dedicated to the art are held throughout the country. The style has also been adopted by Western performers, who use it to create theatrical performances that are often highly innovative and entertaining.

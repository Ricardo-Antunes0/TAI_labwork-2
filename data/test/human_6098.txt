Coldwater Lake is a barrier lake on the border of Cowlitz County and Skamania County, Washington in the United States. The lake was created during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, which blocked its natural outlet, Coldwater Creek, with volcanic debris. It is one of several lakes in the area that were created or otherwise enlarged by the eruption. Geography The lake runs from northeast to southwest, with the west end in Cowlitz County and the east end in Skamania County. The portion of the lake in Skamania County is part of Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Coldwater Creek drains the lake on its southwest end and flows into the North Fork of the Toutle River, a tributary of the Cowlitz River, in turn a tributary of the Columbia River. Coldwater Lake is located  north of Mount St. Helens,  west of Spirit Lake.  Castle Lake, formed in the same manner as Coldwater Lake during the 1980 eruption, is located about  to the south. The area is about  northeast of Longview and  north of Portland, Oregon.

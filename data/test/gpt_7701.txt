WWF Forceable Entry is a soundtrack album by the rock band Kiss, released in 1996. It is their only album with guitarist Tommy Thayer and drummer Eric Singer, who left the band shortly after its release.  The album was produced by vocalist/guitarist Gene Simmons and recorded at Simmons' home studio in Beverly Hills, California. It features nine new tracks and one re-recorded song, "I Was Made for Loving You".   The album was generally well received by critics, who praised its heavy metal sound and Kiss' return to their classic hard rock sound. However, some reviewers found the album too derivative of Kiss' earlier work.

The Fisher Boy is a painting by American painter Edward Hopper. It is housed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.  The painting was created in 1951 and portrays a young man, presumably fisherman, working on a pier. The boy is isolated from the rest of the world, with only the water and his work for company. The painting has been described as "somber" and "depressive".

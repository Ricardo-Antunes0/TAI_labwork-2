Ebora Liberalitas Julia is the name of a Roman colony in the area now known as Peterborough, England. It was founded by the emperor Augustus in the late 1st century AD, and became an important city in Roman Britain.  Ebora Liberalitas Julia was one of the largest and most prosperous Roman settlements in England. The city's prosperity was due to its favourable location, with good access to trade routes both north and south, and its strategic position on the River Nene. Ebora also benefited from its close links with other Roman cities in Britain, and with overseas markets.  Ebora's heyday was during the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, when it was home to a large number of wealthy Roman citizens. However, by the 4th century AD the city had declined in importance, and eventually disappeared altogether around 410 AD. Today, little remains of Ebora other than a small number of archaeological sites.

Explorer 37, also SOLRAD 9 or Solar Orbiter-37, was a solar orbiter launched in 1978 by the United States as part of the Solar System Exploration program. The spacecraft was designed to study the solar atmosphere and to determine the extent of the solar wind. It also studied the sun's magnetic field and performed a number of other scientific investigations. The spacecraft operated for more than 12 years before it was decommissioned in 1987.  Explorer 37 was one of a series of three solar orbiters launched as part of the Solar System Exploration program, which was initiated by NASA in 1977 in response to criticisms of the space agency's lack of knowledge about the outer planets. The other two spacecraft in this series were Voyager 1 and Voyager 2. Explorer 37 was unusual in that it was not designed specifically to study one particular aspect of the solar system, but to perform a comprehensive survey of all aspects of the sun's atmosphere, magnetic field, and outer regions.   The spacecraft consisted of a wingspan of about , a mass of about , and a total mission time of more than 12 years. It was powered by two solar arrays with a total power output of about 260 W each. The spacecraft had an operational orbit with a perihelion (closest approach to the sun) of about and an aphelion ( farthest from the sun) of about .  Explorer 37 carried a variety of scientific instruments, including an ultraviolet spectrometer, an x-ray telescope, an energetic particle detector,

U.S. Route 197 (US 197) is a north–south United States Highway that runs for 753 miles (1,175 km) from the Mexican border at Laredo, Texas, to the Canadian border at Detroit, Michigan. The highway bypasses most of the major cities in between, serving as a major transportation artery between the two countries.  US 197 was predeveloped by various states and federal agencies over several decades. The highway originally began in California as State Route 87 in 1937 and ended in Michigan as State Route 9 in 1963. In 1984, US 87 was realigned onto a new freeway north of San Diego, California, and US 197 was extended its southern terminus to US 95 near Nogales, Arizona. In 1998, US 95 was rerouted onto a new freeway parallel to the Mexican border and US 97 was rerouted to follow US 95 from El Paso to San Diego. As a result of these changes, US 197 had its southern terminus moved north to Laredo and its northern terminus moved to Detroit.  US 197 is a major east–west thoroughfare running through the states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, and Michigan. The highway is also concurrent with Interstate 10 in Arizona and with Interstate 35 in Texas. In California, US 97 is co-signed with US 101 while US 190 runs concurrently with I-5 in Oregon.

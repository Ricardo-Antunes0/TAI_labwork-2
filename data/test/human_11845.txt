Zarya , full name Aleksandra Zaryanova , appears as a playable character in the first-person shooter video game Overwatch, developed in 2016 by Blizzard Entertainment. Zarya also appears as a playable character in the crossover multiplayer online battle arena game Heroes of the Storm. She is voiced by Dolya Gavanski. Concept and creation Aleksandra Zaryanova, or Zarya for short, is a Russian powerlifter and soldier. She was initially conceived for Overwatch by artist Arnold Tsang after watching a weightlifting competition. He recognized that the body shape of weightlifters was non-standard but would make for a great, tough female hero. She was created in part to satisfy calls from fans to add more diverse body types after the initial set of heroes were revealed for the game. Her design was inspired by one of Blizzard's 3D artists, Tamara Bakhlycheva, particularly her pink pixie cut hairstyle. Overwatch director Jeff Kaplan noted her as an example of how character designs challenge the stereotypes of their character types. She is armed with a Particle Cannon that can either emit a continuous beam of energy or launch an energy projectile in an arc. She is also able to project a personal Particle Barrier onto herself or onto one of her teammates (Projected Barrier), and soaking up damage with these barriers raises the power of her own attacks proportionally. Zarya's ultimate ability, Graviton Surge, forms a gravity well that pulls enemies in and damages them, leaving them open to other attacks. Zarya is voiced by Dolya Gavanski.

John Patton (Colonel) was born 1745 in Sligo, Ireland. He immigrated to Philadelphia about 1765. John Patton married Jane Davis on March 7, 1777 and they had 11 children: Rachael, Benjamin, William, John, Francis, Joseph, Edward, Anna, Jane, Samuel and Ellen. John Patton died 1804 in Centre County, Pennsylvania. Patton was a major in Samuel Miles' Pennsylvania State Rifle Regiment and distinguished himself in command of the unit's 2nd Battalion during the New York Campaign. George Washington authorized him to raise Patton's Additional Continental Regiment. John Parke and Peter Scull became the field officers while Patton was promoted to colonel. Seven companies were recruited from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. From May 1777, the regiment fought as part of the 4th Virginia Brigade in the Philadelphia Campaign. In July 1778 the unit was reassigned to the Highlands Department. In January 1779, Patton's Regiment was merged with other units to become the "new" 11th Pennsylvania Regiment. However, Captain Allen McLane's Delaware company was reassigned to the 1st Delaware Regiment.

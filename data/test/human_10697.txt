Tango was a comics anthology published in Melbourne, Australia by Cardigan Comics, with nine issues of Tango, published intermittently from 1997 to 2009, and an additional compilation The Tango Collection, published in 2009 by Allen & Unwin. Overview Tango is described as "the Australian romance comics anthology".  Each issue features contributions by comic artists living and working in Melbourne and other parts of Australia and New Zealand.  The first three issues of Tango were large format publications, inspired by large format anthologies from the United States such as the early issues of RAW.  Later issues became smaller in format, and beginning with the fourth issue in 2001 (Tango Quatro), each has been sub-titled with a theme of "Love and ...".  Respectively, the themes for issues four through nine have been: 'Love and Death', 'Love and the Senses', 'Love and Sex', 'Love and Sedition' 'Love and Food', and 'Love and War'.  Drawing on contributions from the first eight issues of Tango, Allen and Unwin published The Tango Collection in 2009. In 2017-2018 the State Library of Victoria featured 'Tango' in its ongoing exhibition about the history of the book, 'The Mirror of the World'.

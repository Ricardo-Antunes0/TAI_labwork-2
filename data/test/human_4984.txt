Playing their home games at Kilbowie Park, they were elected to the Scottish Football League in 1966. Clydebank had two short spells in the Scottish Premier Division, and reached the semi-final of the Scottish Cup in 1990, whilst a First Division club. After the club's ground was sold off in 1996, their matches were played in a series of groundshares in different towns in front of dwindling crowds. Moves to other locations were rejected, before the club was bought out in 2002 and moved to Airdrie and renamed Airdrie United to replace that town's previous club which had been liquidated. Airdrie United relinquished ownership of the Clydebank name a year later and it was transferred to a new phoenix club, also named Clydebank F.C., which began life in the West Region Junior Leagues.

Up-Tech UAVs are Chinese unmanned aerial vehicles developed by Beijing Up-Tech Co., Ltd. (Up-Tech, 北京博创兴盛科技有限公司). Originally a provider of cybernetics and robotics, Up-Tech is also a provider of aviation subsystem including autopilot, flight control system (FCS), navigational system and aviation software. Recently, Up-Tech has expanded its business to manufacturing the entire UAV thru its IFLY UAS division, in addition to providing subsystems. Twin-boom UAV The first UAV developed by Up-Tech is a twin-boom UAV that was first revealed in June 2008 at the UAV Convention/Exhibition held in Beijing at Wendushuicheng (温都水城) Hotel, which was the second UAV convention / exhibition held in China, after the first of its kind held in China back in 2006. The twin boom UAV developed by Up-Tech utilizes commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) airframe and it is in high wing configuration with twin tail. Propulsion is provided by a two-blade propeller driven pusher engine mounted at the rear end of the empennage. The land gear is rather unusual among Chinese UAVs in that it adopts a combination of landing gear systems that is rarely adopted by other Chinese UAVs: the landing gear consists of a pair of skids, with a pair of wheels on each skid.

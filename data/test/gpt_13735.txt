Schizoid personality disorder (, often abbreviated as SPD) is a mental disorder characterized by a lack of emotional expressiveness, restricted social interactions, and a lack of interest in activities that are typically enjoyed by people with normal personalities. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) defines SPD as "a disorder in which individuals have unusually intense and prolonged feelings of emptiness or loneliness, often accompanied by feelings of detachment from others and a reduced need for social interaction".  The exact cause of SPD is unknown, but it may be related to problems in early development. Some people with SPD also have a history of trauma or abuse. Treatment typically involves therapy and medication. SPD is considered to be a serious disorder and can lead to social isolation and depression. It is estimated that about 1 percent of the population has SPD.

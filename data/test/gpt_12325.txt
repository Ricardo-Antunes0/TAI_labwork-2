A routing algorithm decides the path followed by a packet in a network. The algorithm takes into account the network topology, e.g., the presence of loops and other barriers to routing. One common type of routing algorithm is turn restriction routing.  Turn restriction routing is an algorithm that allows a router to choose a shortest path between two destinations by considering only those possible paths that require a single turn. This is in contrast to the more common algorithm, which considers all possible paths, even those that require multiple turns. By preventing routers from following paths that require multiple turns, turn restriction routing can improve network throughput and reduce the number of routing updates needed.

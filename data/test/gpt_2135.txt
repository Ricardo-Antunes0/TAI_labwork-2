 "Rain Shower", also "Shower" or "Sonagi," (소나기) is a form of Korean traditional dance and music. The dance is often performed during rainstorms to encourage the heavens to provide rain.  It is also a popular event for celebrating milestones, such as weddings and births. The dance is usually accompanied by music played on a shamisen, a three-stringed Japanese instrument.  The dance is believed to have originated in the Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392). Originally, the dancers would perform in front of government buildings during bad weather in order to request rain from the heavens.

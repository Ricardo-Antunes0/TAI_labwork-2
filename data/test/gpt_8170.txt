The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Virginia, often referred to as the Virginia Constitution, is the fundamental law of the state of Virginia. Ratified in 1776, it was designed to unite the Thirteen Colonies that then comprised British North America. The document establishes a parliamentary government for the commonwealth and sets out the rights and responsibilities of its citizens. It also establishes the structure of government, including a bicameral legislature, executive, and judicial branches.  The Constitution of Virginia is one of the most influential written constitutions in American history. It has been used as a model by other states, as well as by the United States Constitution. The Virginia Constitution is also noteworthy for its preamble, which declares that all men are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.

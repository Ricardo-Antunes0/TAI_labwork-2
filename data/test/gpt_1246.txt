Lancero (English: Lancer) is a military course of fire used by cavalry in Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Uruguay.  The lance is a European weapon that originated in the Late Middle Ages. It is a spear with a long, pointed head and a triangular cross-section at the base. The lance's advantage over the sword was that it could be used from horseback without having to dismount.

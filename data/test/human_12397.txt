In Hinduism, the goddess Tara  is the second of the Dasa (ten) Mahavidyas or "Great Wisdom goddesses", and is a form of Adishakti, the tantric manifestations of Parvati. Her most famous centre of worship is the temple and the cremation ground of Tarapithin West Bengal, India. Her three most famous forms are Ekajaṭā, Ugratara, and Nīlasarasvatī(pronounced Neel Saraswati in Hindi) Legends and theology The commonly known origin of Tara is from the 17th chapter of the Rudrayāmala which describes the initial unsuccessful attempts of the brahminical sage Vasiṣṭha in the worship of the deity (his initial locations are usually placed by the ocean or in Kāmākhyā according to the Brahmayāmala) and the subsequent meeting of Vishnu in the form of Buddha in the region of Mahācīna and his eventual success by the means of kaula rites which employ the five makāras of Shaakta kaula tantra. She is also described as the form of the Atharvaveda (atharvavedaśākhinī). Her Bhairava is described as Akṣobhya in the Todala tantra because he drank the deadly halāhala poison without agitation (a-kṣobha).According to the Svatantra Tantra Tara protects her devotees from difficult (ugra) dangers and so she is also known as Ugratārā. The goddess is all-pervading and also manifests in the Earth. A devotee who attains success in her mantra is said to get the ability to create poems and gets complete understanding of all the Shastras and attains moksha.

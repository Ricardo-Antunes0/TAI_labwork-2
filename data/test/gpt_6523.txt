The Corey–House synthesis (also called the Corey–Posner–Whitesides–House synthesis or simply Corey–House) is a mathematical theory of electron correlation in condensed matter, which was developed by American physicists John C. Corey and Sheldon L. Whitehouse and British physicist David P. House in the 1970s.  The Corey–House theory is a quantum mechanical theory of electron correlations in condensed matter, which is also known as a spin-statistics theory. It is based on the exchange of quantum mechanical spin between particles, and uses the Pauli exclusion principle to describe how these spin correlations are constrained. The Corey–House theory has been applied to a wide range of problems in condensed matter, including ferromagnetism, superconductivity, and magnetism on the one hand, and optical phenomena such as light scattering and fluorescence on the other.

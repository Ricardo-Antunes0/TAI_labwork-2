Knowledge were a Jamaican roots reggae group, who achieved international fame in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Formed in Kingston in 1972, the band consisted of Winston Riley (vocals, guitar), Carlton Livingston (bass), Earl Sixteen (drums), and Alton Ellis (guitar, keyboards).   Known for their powerful vocal harmonies and reggae-influenced rhythm section, Knowledge had a string of Top 40 hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including "I Shot The Sheriff", "Ruby Red", "Give It Up", and "In The Summertime". They also released successful studio albums throughout this period, including 1978's self-titled debut album and 1979's Roots, Culture, and Reggae.   By the early 1990s, however, Knowledge had largely retired from live performance. They resumed touring in 2007 and released their first new album in over 20 years, entitled Black & Blue, in 2009.

Flavius Timasius (died 396) was a general of the Roman army in the 4th century AD. He was the son of an officer of the same name.  Timasius served with distinction against the Goths in 376, and in 378 he was appointed governor of Britain by Theodosius I. He played an important part in the victory of Adrianople (378), and in 379 he defeated the Visigoths at the Battle of Aquae Sextiae.  In 380 Theodosius I made him prefect of the Praetorian Guard, and in 381 he was sent to suppress a revolt in Africa. In 383 he was made governor of Syria, where he successfully defended Constantinople against an attack by the Goths in 384. On Theodosius's death (395) Timasius retired to his estates at Sirmium.

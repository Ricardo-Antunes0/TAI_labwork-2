Love Cosmetics (1969 - 1980) was introduced by Menley & James Laboratories on March 1, 1969. By the summer of 1970, the company was marketing and promoting Fresh Lemon bath products and Soft Eyes items to beautify the eyes. Advertising was coordinated by Wells, Rich, Greene advertising agency (1967 - 1990), a company founded by Mary Wells Lawrence. Love's advertising budget surpassed $7 million. There was an emphasis on a long-term building operation, with advertisements on television and in women's magazines. A 4-page spread appeared in the February 1969 Harper's Bazaar. The headline theme was This is the way Love is in 1969. The opening continued with Love today is different than it's ever been. It's freer, more natural, more honest-more out in the open. So are the girls who fall in love these days. Singer Andy Williams hosted a mid-March 1969 Andy Williams Love Special. Love Cosmetics is credited with introducing the lemon craze. Ownership

He spent his younger years in Manila, and California, before moving permanently to the U.S. in 1984.  During his time in the Philippines, Ralph helped found a street performance company called Bodabil, later renamed UP Peryante.  The group, led by Chris Millado, used vaudeville as a form of protest theater against the Marcos dictatorship.     His experiences in performing and organizing would serve him well after founding Ma-Yi Theater Company in New York City, in the summer of 1989, along with colleagues from the Philippines.  He became Ma-Yi Theater’s Artistic Director in 1996.  Since then, and in partnership with Jorge Z. Ortoll, Ma-Yi’s Executive Director, Ralph has worked to make Ma-Yi Theater Company one of the country’s leading venue for new Asian American Theater. As part of his work with Ma-Yi Theatre, Peña directed the world premiere of Hansol Jung's Among the Dead in 2016.

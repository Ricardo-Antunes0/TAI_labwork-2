When he was young, he wanted to become a novelist or journalist, though his father persuaded him otherwise. However, the elder Chang was an official in charge of finance for the Yin county government and later a bank manager. Due to his father's career change and also the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Chang family lived in Nanjing, Guangzhou, Chongqing and Shanghai. Morris Chang spent most of his primary school years in British Hong Kong between the ages of six and eleven. In 1941, the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong began and Chang's family went back to Shanghai and Ningbo to live for a few months, eventually making their way to  the Nationalist government temporary capital in Chongqing. In 1948, as China was in the height of the Chinese Civil War, a year before Peopleâ€™s Republic of China established, Chang again moved to Hong Kong.

Gunkholing is a boating term referring to the practice of intentionally fouling a waterway with refuse or other floating material, to impede or prevent passage.  Gunkholing can be done intentionally or unintentionally, as a form of protest or as a way to create shoals that can be difficult for other boats to navigate. Gunkholing can also be done as part of a futile effort to clean up a polluted waterway.  There are many different ways to gunkhole a river or canal, and the technique can vary depending on the location and the size of the waterway. Some common methods include using tires, barrels, plastic containers, and even refrigerators.  Gunkholing has been used for centuries to protest against pollution, to create navigational hazards, and to clean up waterways. It remains an effective method for cleaning up waterways and preventing pollution, though it is often controversial.

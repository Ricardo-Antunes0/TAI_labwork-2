The Presidential Palace , also referred to by the metonym Pantovčak, is the official workplace of the President of Croatia since late 1991, situated in Pantovčak, Zagreb. However, the president does not reside in the building and it is instead used to house the Office of the President, while the president continues to reside in his or her private residence during the duration of their term of office.  Even so, welcoming ceremonies for visiting foreign dignitaries, state functions commemorating national holidays and consultations with leaders of parliamentary parties during post-election government formation processes, among others, are all usually held at the palace. Furthermore, it has become somewhat customary for the outgoing president and the president-elect to hold a bilateral meeting and a joint press conference in the palace on the former's last day in office, before his or her final departure from the palace grounds and the beginning of the latter's term of office at midnight.

The term physics envy is a phrase used to describe a feeling of dissatisfaction or jealousy toward people who seem to have more success in the field of physics than oneself. It is often due to the feeling that one's own abilities do not measure up to those of others, and that one is therefore not as good as one might be.  The term "physics envy" was first coined in the early 1990s by a group of Stanford University students who were unhappy with their academic standing and felt they did not measure up to their physics peers. The term has since been used more generally to describe a feeling of dissatisfaction or jealousy toward people who seem to have more success in any field of science, particularly those who are considered "nerds" or "geeks".  There are a number of reasons why people may feel physics envy. Some people may feel that their own abilities do not measure up to those of others, and that they are not as good as they could be. Others may feel that they do not have the opportunity or resources to pursue a physics career, and so envy those who do. Finally, some people may simply find physics fascinating and wish they could understand it better.

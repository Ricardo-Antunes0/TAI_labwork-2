Methanol toxicity is poisoning from methanol, characteristically manifested by anemia, CNS dysfunction, and renal failure. Methanol is an industrial solvent and fuel that is also used as a antifreeze and paint stripper. It can be found in various alcoholic drinks and can also be produced from wood by the action of microorganisms.  Methanol toxicity is a serious health concern, particularly in people who are especially vulnerable to its effects, such as the elderly, pregnant women, and children. Methanol exposure can cause anemia, CNS dysfunction, and renal failure. Ingestion of methanol can also cause blindness due to methanol's effect on the optic nerve.

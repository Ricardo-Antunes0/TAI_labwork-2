The slit sensilla, also known as the mechanoreceptor cells, are a type of receptor cell that are sensitive to pressure, movement, and temperature. They are located on the sides of the cilium, which is an extension of the flagellum found in bacteria and other protists.  The slit sensilla are responsible for detecting a variety of environmental stimuli, such as changes in pressure or temperature. They are also used to detect movement and orientation within the environment. This information is then used by the cell to adjust its behaviour or metabolism.  The slit sensilla are located on the sides of the cilium and can detect a variety of environmental stimuli.

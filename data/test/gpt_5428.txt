Margaret MacDonald was born in 1815 in the town of Lochgelly, in the Scottish Highlands. She was the daughter of a weaver and a midwife. MacDonald became interested in the arts at an early age and, after studying at a convent school in Lochgelly, she began working as a teacher.   In 1843, MacDonald moved to Edinburgh to study art. She soon began exhibiting her work, and by 1848, she had become one of the most popular artists in Scotland. MacDonald's paintings depicted scenes from Scottish mythology and history, and she is credited with helping to revive interest in Scottish art.   During the 1850s, MacDonald moved to London to continue her art career. She became associated with the Pre-Raphaelite movement, and her work was featured in exhibitions at the Royal Academy of Arts. MacDonald later returned to Scotland, where she lived until her death in 1885.

Bioorganometallic chemistry is the study of biologically active metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These materials are composed of metal atoms and organic molecules, and display a range of unusual and interesting properties.  Bioorganometallic materials have a wide range of potential applications in fields such as energy, environmental protection, and healthcare. They can act as catalysts, storage devices, and sensors. Bioorganometallic materials also have potential as new drugs and medical devices.  The first bioorganometallic material was developed in the early 1990s. Since then, research has led to the discovery of many new bioorganometallic materials. The field is still growing rapidly, with new discoveries being made every year.

Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511 (1985), is a United States Supreme Court case that tested the constitutionality of a Georgia law that made it a misdemeanor to teach the "subversive doctrine" of black nationalism.  The case was brought by two African Americans, Mitchell and Joseph Hill, who were convicted under the statute for teaching a class on African-American history and culture. The Court ruled in favor of the defendants, holding that the statute violated the First Amendment's freedom of speech guarantee.

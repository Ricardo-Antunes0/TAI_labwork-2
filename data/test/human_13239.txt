Gaius Nymphidius Sabinus (c. 35â€“68) was a Prefect of the Praetorian Guard during the rule of Emperor Nero from 65 until his death in 68. He shared this office together with Ofonius Tigellinus, replacing his previous colleague Faenius Rufus. During the second half of the 60s, Nero grew increasingly unpopular with the people and the army, leading to a number of rebellions which ultimately caused his downfall and suicide in 68. Nymphidius took part in the final conspiracy against Nero and persuaded the Praetorian Guard to desert him, but when he attempted to have himself declared emperor, he was killed by his own soldiers. Life Nymphidius Sabinus was the son of an imperial freedwoman, Nymphidia (daughter of Gaius Julius Callistus). Galba records speculation that his father was a gladiator named Martianus, whom he resembled, but it was rumored (probably falsely) that he was the illegitimate son of a previous Roman Emperor, Caligula.

Silas Dinsmoor (September 26, 1766 – June 17, 1847) was an appointed U. S. Agent to the Cherokee (1794–1798) and to the Choctaw (1801–1813).  He later served as a surveyor in Alabama before eventually retiring to Boone County, Kentucky, where he is buried at the Dinsmore Homestead. Early life  Born in Windham, New Hampshire, Silas Dinsmore was of Scots-Irish descent and was part of a large group of inter-related families who settled in southern New Hampshire in the early 1700s. Through his mother, Martha McKeen, he was related to Joseph McKeen, the first president of Bowdoin College in Maine.  He was also a first cousin of Pennsylvania Governor Thomas McKean, a signer of the Declaration of Independence.  Silas worked his way through Dartmouth College by teaching, a profession he continued to practice after his graduation.  At nearby Atkinson Academy he taught a newly formed co-educational class of students, opening up the chance for young ladies to learn Logic, Greek, and Rhetoric - topics normally reserved for male students.

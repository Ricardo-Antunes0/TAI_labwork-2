The Itchen Navigation is a  disused waterway in the English county of Hampshire. It is a remnant of an ancient river system that once flowed through the county.  The Itchen Navigation was first established in the early medieval period as a means of transportation between the ports of Southampton and Winchester. In later years, it was used to transport goods between the eastern and western parts of the county. The navigation eventually fell into disuse after the construction of the A34 road in the 1960s. Today, it is only used for recreational purposes.

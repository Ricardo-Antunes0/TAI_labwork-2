The Lembaga Kebudajaan Rakjat (EYD: Lembaga Kebudayaan Rakyat, often abbreviated Lekra; meaning Institute for the People's Culture) was a very prolific literary and social movement associated with the Indonesian Communist Party. Founded in 1950, Lekra pushed for artists, writers and teachers to follow the doctrine of socialist realism. Increasingly vocal against non-Lekra members, the group rallied against the Manifes Kebudayaan (Cultural Manifesto), eventually leading to President Sukarno banning it with some hesitations. After the 30 September Movement, Lekra was banned together with the communist party. History Lekra was founded in August 1950 as a response to the socio-nationalist Gelanggang Movement, with A.S. Dharma as its first secretary general. It published the Mukadimah, meaning "introduction", as a manifest calling for young people, especially artists, writers and teacher, to assist in establishing a people's democratic republic. Its efforts in the North Sumatran capital of Medan were made successful by the efforts of Bakri Siregar.

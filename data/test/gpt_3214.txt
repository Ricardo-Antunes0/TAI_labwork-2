Snake Hill (known officially as Laurel Hill) is a small, privately owned hill in the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The hill is located in the southwest corner of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project site and is bounded by Massachusetts Avenue to the east, Northampton Street to the south, and Brattle Street to the west.  The hill is named for a large snake that was once found living in the area. The snake was killed and its body was buried on the hill. Over time, the snake's legend grew and it became known as Snake Hill.  The hill is now a popular spot for residents and visitors to enjoy a quiet walk, sunbathe, or take in the sights and sounds of Cambridge. The hill is also home to several small businesses and a few homes.

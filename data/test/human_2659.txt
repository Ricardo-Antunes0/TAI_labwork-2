Harveys was a department store chain best known for its original store in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. The original Harveys department store was opened by Fred Harvey in 1942 at the corner of 6th Avenue North and Church Street in Nashville, Tennessee.  The site was the former home of a post-Reconstruction Nashville retailer, Lebeck Brothers/Denton & Company, which rose to prominence in the 1870s.  When the Lebeck Brothersâ€™ property became available due to the store's closing, Fred Harvey founded Harveys department store on the property. The store expanded to eventually cover the entire block of Church Street from 6th Avenue to 5th Avenue. The store brought the first escalators to Middle Tennessee and the decor featured several carousel horses which had been salvaged from Glendale Park, a local amusement park that closed during the Great Depression. The store was also known for its lavish Christmas decorations as well as the annual Nativity scene it sponsored in Centennial Park.

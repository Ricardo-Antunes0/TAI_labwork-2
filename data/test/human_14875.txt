The Days  is a novelized autobiography in three volumes by the Egyptian professor Taha Hussein, published between 1926 and 1967.  It deals with his childhood in a small village, then his studies in Egypt and France. It is one of the most popular works of modern Arabic literature. Volumes The first volume was serialized in Al-Hilal, a literary magazine, from January 1926 to January 1927, then published as a book in 1929. It covers the author's childhood, with themes of the ignorance prevalent in rural Egypt and the customs practiced at that time, and provides a detailed description of traditional Islamic education. It is written in a mixture of first and third person narrative. Hussein often interrupts himself, suggesting a lack of control. There are many references to the art of listening and descriptive details about the way things smell or feel, as Hussein subtly reveals that he has gone blind. It was published in English in 1932, titled An Egyptian Childhood and translated by E. H. Paxton.

Egge Church  is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Steinkjer municipality in Tr√∏ndelag county, Norway. It is located in the Egge area, on the northern edge of the town of Steinkjer. It is the church for the Egge parish which is part of the Stiklestad prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nidaros. The white, wooden church was built in a long church design in the empire style in 1870 using plans drawn up by the architect Rasmus Mentsen Overrein. The church seats about 330 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1490, but the church was not new that year. The first church was a stave church that was likely built in the 14th century. The old church stood for several centuries. Records from 1588 indicate that there were 29 farmers that belonged to the church. In 1661, supports were added to the church to keep it standing as it was in very poor condition.

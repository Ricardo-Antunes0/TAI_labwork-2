The Papists Act 1715 (2 Geo., c. 12) was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. It repealed the earlier Papists Act 1714, which had been enacted to punish Roman Catholic priests and followers.  The original Papists Act was passed in order to punish Roman Catholic priests and their followers for their active support of the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715. The Act was introduced in the House of Commons by Robert Walpole on 2 June 1714 and passed with little opposition on 16 June. The main provisions of the Act were as follows:  -Any Roman Catholic priest found guilty of preaching or teaching Catholicism would be imprisoned for a term not exceeding two years, or fined £1,000, or both; -Any Roman Catholic follower found guilty of assisting a priest in violation of the Act would be imprisoned for a term not exceeding six months, or fined £100, or both; -Any Protestant minister who refused to baptize or marry a Catholic would be imprisoned for a term not exceeding twelve months, or fined £200, or both.

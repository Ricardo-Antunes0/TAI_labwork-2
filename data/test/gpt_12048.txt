Pastoral farming (also known in some regions as agroforestry, agroecology, or integrative land use) is an agricultural system in which livestock are used to produce food, fiber, and other products on a small scale on lands that are not devoted to crop production. Pastoral farming systems are considered alternative or complementary to traditional agricultural practices, and may involve management of land in ways that mimic the native flora and fauna.  Pastoral farming has seen a resurgence in recent years as an environmentally friendly, sustainable alternative to traditional agriculture. The systems are often more efficient than traditional agriculture, and they can be more beneficial to the environment because they rely less on chemical pesticides and fertilizers. Pastoral farming systems can also be more labor-intensive than traditional agriculture, which may be a disadvantage in some areas. However, pastoral farming systems are often more affordable than traditional agriculture, and they can be more profitable for small farmers.

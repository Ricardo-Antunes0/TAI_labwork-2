Gnathaena  was an Athenian hetaira (plural: hetairai), a class of ancient Greek prostitutes who were companions to wealthy men. Though there is no source for either her date of birth or date of death, Gnathaena is known to have lived during the 4th century BCE due to her affiliations with various men of the era. Her most notable lover was Diphilus, an Athenian New Comedy playwright. According to Athenaeus, Gnathaena was famous for her lavish parties and witty repartee, and even wrote a treatise on proper conduct at her symposiums entitled, "Rules for Dining in Company". Life as a hetaira  Gnathaena was one of many fourth-century women in the class of prostitutes known as a hetaira, or "companion". The hetairai were a class of courtesans in ancient Greece that were distinct from pornai, another type of prostitute, as hetairai were thought to be women who consorted exclusively in aristocratic circles and with only a few men as opposed to selling sexual acts through a brothel as pornai did. Hetairai were not paid according to what sexual acts they performed with their patrons; instead, they were paid for their companionship over a long period of time. They also provided intellectual stimulation in addition to sexual pleasure and were thought to be well-educated in some circumstances. However, this definition of what hetairai did is contested by the Oxford Classical Dictionary (second edition) as well as by the lawyer Apollodorus in his prosecution speech "Against Neaera". Both of these sources maintain that hetairai were grouped in with pornai as general prostitutes.

Dawgwood is a 1993 all-instrumental album by American musician David Grisman, recorded with his group David Grisman Quintet. It is the second album recorded under Grisman's own label, Acoustic Disc. Grisman's self-named "Dawg" music was well established when this album was recorded — it is influenced by traditional bluegrass, jazz, gypsy music, Latin and more. Most of the songs are composed by Grisman, the two covers being Django Reinhardt's "Bolero de Django" — a gypsy song which Matt Eakle's flute gives a more modern flavour and "Asanhado" by Jacob do Bandolim. The last piece on the album, "New Dawg´s Rag" is a song previously released on album The David Grisman Quintet, but with "updated" arrangement.

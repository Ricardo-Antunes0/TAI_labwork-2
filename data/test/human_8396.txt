Outside of athletics he ran a grocery store and a dry cleaning business and provided the financing to found the Helsingør Pigegarde (Helsingør Women's Guard). He died in January 2011, one month after his hundredth birthday. Early life and athletic career Larsen was born on December 12, 1910 in Helsingør, Denmark. At the age of 13 he began playing football for Helsingør IF (now Elite 3000 Fodbold). By 1928, however, he had switched to track and field athletics and began running for the club in cross-country tournaments.

Biography Andrews was born in Bangor, Maine. His parents divorced when he was 12 months old. He was raised by his mother's parents in Pineville, Louisiana. They moved to Monroe, Louisiana, when he was ten years old. After he graduated from high school in Monroe, he decided to live with his mother in St. Louis. They did not get along very well. He said, "I was young and set in my ways and thought I knew everything like every child does." He worked for his stepfather as a maintenance man at the motel that his stepfather managed. Andrews needed parts to repair a broken vacuum cleaner, so he went to the O.K. Vacuum repair shop co-owned by Rusty Wallace's father and uncle. Gary Wallace, Rusty's uncle, had a conversation with Andrews about vacuum cleaners and other topics. Gary Wallace offered Andrews a job. Andrews helped move the vacuum cleaner repair shop to a larger facility. Andrews worked closely with Rusty Wallace and the two got to know each other well.  After work, he helped fix Wallace's USAC stock car, starting in 1979. He moved with Wallace to the ASA in 1983 when the team won the championship. Wallace moved from USAC to NASCAR in 1984, and Andrews moved to Louisiana to run Wallace's Sportsman for his driver Nicki Fraisson. Andrews quit in 1986.

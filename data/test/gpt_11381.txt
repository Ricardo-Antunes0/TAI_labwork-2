Ronald Haver (January 14, 1939 – May 14, 2016) was an American mathematician and computer scientist.  Ronald Haver was born in 1939 in Boston, Massachusetts. After graduating from high school, he studied at Harvard University, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1961 and his master's degree in 1962. He then went to the University of California, Berkeley, where he received his doctorate in 1965.  Haver began his career as a research fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He then moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he served as a professor until his retirement in 2000.  Haver's research focused on the theory of linearized partial differential equations and their applications to fluid mechanics and mathematical physics. He is particularly known for his work on the Euler–Lagrange equation and its variants. He also developed algorithms for solving these equations and has made significant contributions to the field of computational fluid dynamics.  Haver was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 1976 and a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1988. He died on May 14, 2016 at the age of 80.

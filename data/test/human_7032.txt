Jacob Moorer (April 1863 â€“ February 27, 1935) was a South Carolina lawyer and civil rights activist. He frequently fought cases in opposition to the elector provisions of the 1895 South Carolina Constitution, which he viewed as disenfranchising blacks. His most famous case was Franklin v. South Carolina, a murder case involving black sharecropper Pink Franklin which he and John Adams, Sr. appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Life Moorer was born during the Civil War in Orangeburg County, South Carolina to Wilson and Hazel Moorer. He learned to read and write by age 8, and worked on his father's farm. He graduated from the college of the Normal School at Claflin University in 1892 and was admitted to the bar in 1896. Education was very important to him, before passing the bar he was principal of LaGrange Academy in Georgia and he believed in universal education. In 1898 in a debate society, he argued in the negative on the question, "Does the present system of education among the colored people create a supply for which there is no demand?" He was one of few black lawyers in the area, it was reported in 1905 that he was the only black at the Orangeburg bar. He was noted for his formal dress, which was remarkable in the summer South Carolina heat. In 1899, he married renowned black poet, Lizelia Augusta Jenkins Moorer; they had no children.

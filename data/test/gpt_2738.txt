Orbiculariae is a potential clade of araneomorph spiders, comprising all spiders that have a habitus characterized by an orbicular or spherical body plan, as opposed to the more common linear body plan of spiders. Orbiculariae is monophyletic, and includes all known orbicular-bodied spiders, as well as groups of spiders traditionally classified as other araneomorphs. Orbiculariae is the sister group of the Euophrysinae, which includes all euophrysid spiders.

Orbiculariae is the sister group of the Euophrysinae, which includes all euophrysid spiders.  Orbiculariae was first proposed in 2009 by Michael Sibley and Peter J. Makovicky and is included in the 2007 World Spider Catalog by Nomenclature Committee International (NCCI). The clade was named for the orb-like shape of many of its members' bodies.

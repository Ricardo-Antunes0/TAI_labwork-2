Ganja Gate  is one of the four entrance gates to the Shusha fortress in Shusha—known to its historical Armenian population as Shushi—a city in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, currently part of Azerbaijan. The fortress and the city were part of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast; they later were under the control of the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh, from the Battle of Shusha on May 8, 1992 until 8 November 2020, when the Azerbaijani Armed Forces retook the city after a 3-day long battle. Description In compliance with medieval traditions in urban development of the khanate period, Shusha castle walls were built with four gates. The main gate was facing north towards the road to Ganja, Azerbaijan and was therefore named Ganja Gate. The western gate was facing western regions including the Iranian Erivan Khanate and was hence called Erivan Gate. The other two gates opened to surrounding highland villages. Shusha's internal castle was located on a peak near the Ganja Gate. The Ganja Gate bears architectural importance and is often mentioned among other significant 279 attributes of Shusha State Historical and Architectural Reserve of the 18th century. Ganja Gate is located on Niyazi street.

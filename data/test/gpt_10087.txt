Save Point Lowly is a community action group in the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was founded in 2006 by a group of neighborhood activists who wanted to address the lack of safe places for kids to play in their community.  Save Point Lowly works to create and maintain safe, green spaces in the city for kids to play. We do this by working with the city to create and maintain public playgrounds and by organizing cleanup events and community mural projects. We also offer educational programs about healthy living and environmental stewardship for kids.

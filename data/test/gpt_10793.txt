National security, or national defence, is the process of protecting the citizens of a country from threats to their safety and security. National security is also the prevention of hostile actions by other countries, or by terrorists.  National security is a complex and multi-layered phenomenon that cannot be fully understood without a comprehensive understanding of the political, social, economic, and military dimensions of international relations. It is also an ever-evolving field and constantly evolving due to new threats and methods of attack.  National security is a responsibility shared by the government, the private sector, civil society and the international community. It involves protecting citizens from physical harm, economic ruin, social chaos, and psychological trauma. It also involves securing the nation's borders and protecting its critical infrastructure.  National security is an important part of democracy and it should be safeguarded at all costs. However, national security cannot be guaranteed without strong economic and social foundations. The government must work cooperatively with all sectors of society to ensure that national security is achieved.

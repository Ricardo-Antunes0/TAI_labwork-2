Scientastic! is an elementary to middle school science education program that uses hands-on science experiments, games, and learning tools to help students learn about the physical and chemical properties of matter.  Scientastic! was created by Dr. Michael A. Ciarcia in 2006 as a way to help students learn about science while having fun. The program has since been used in schools all over the world, and has been praised for its engaging and fun approach to science education.  Scientastic! is divided into three main sections: Elementary, Middle, and High School. In each section, there are different levels of difficulty so that everyone can enjoy the program. There are also multiple learning tools available, including online games, quizzes, and learning modules that can be used with or without a computer.

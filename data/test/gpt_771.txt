About Your Sexuality, or AYS, was a website that offered educational information on human sexuality. It was founded in 1998 by Dr. Laura Berman and Dr. Judith S. Reisman, both clinicians and educators in the field of human sexuality.  YS offered information on a variety of sexual topics, including relationships, contraception, STIs, sex education, and gender identity. The site also featured a forum and chat room where users could discuss sexual topics and connect with other AYS users.  YS was shut down in December 2017 due to financial difficulties.

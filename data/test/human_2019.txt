Goeznovius (died c. 675 according to one account but more probably fl. sixth century.), also known as Goueznou, was a Cornish-born Bishop of Léon in Brittany, who is venerated as a saint in the region around Brest and the diocese of Léon. According to his Legenda he was born in Cornwall and became one of many of his countrymen who moved to the continent in the wake of the Anglo-Saxon invasions and helped found the Brittonic settlement in Armorica that became established as Brittany. His feast day is celebrated on 25 October. Legenda Sancti Goeznovii Goeznovius is known through his hagiography, the Legenda Sancti Goeznovii. The author names himself as William, a Breton chaplain in the familia of the otherwise-unattested Bishop Eudo of Léon, and gives a date of 1019 for the work, though it is now dated to the late 12th or early 13th century AD. The Legenda includes an unusual preface detailing the history of Brittany and including some episodes from Britain's traditional history.

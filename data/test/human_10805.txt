Peter Terson (born Peter Patterson; 16 February 1932 â€“ 8 April 2021) was a British playwright whose plays have been produced for stage, television and radio.  Most of his theatre work was first produced at the Victoria Theatre in Stoke-on-Trent in conjunction with director Peter Cheeseman who championed his work and directed over twenty of his plays.  Cheeseman was crucial in helping Terson to learn how to edit and structure his work. Terson was born in Walker, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. His father, Peter Patterson was a joiner.  His first play was A Night to Make the Angels Weep in 1964 - the last was Rumpelstiltskin, a play for children, in 1984.  Many of his plays focused on the Vale of Evesham where Terson lived before becoming resident dramatist at the theatre. He also became an astute adaptor of novels by Arnold Bennett and Herman Melville.  As a result of the success of his work in Stoke, he was invited to write for the National Youth Theatre where his work focused on growing up in the dead-end working-class culture of industrial England. From 1956 to 1958 Terson trained at Redland Teacher Training College in Bristol, a college of Bristol University. He taught for 10 years before writing professionally. He taught History and P.E. at what was then Blackminster County Secondary School, near Littleton, Worcestershire. Terson left Blackminster in the mid-1960s.

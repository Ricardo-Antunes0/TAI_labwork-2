Plot Bobby Day (Bobby Rydell) is the leader of a rock 'n roll band called Bobby Day and the Four Knights. The band members live on an old bus named The Lucinda, driven by their manager, P. J. Cunningham (James Dunn), and travel to one-night gigs across the country seeking their big break. In the pilot, P. J. has booked them at a country club benefit. They set up and start playing "The Twist", but are told to leave by the organizer, Linda Craig (Stefanie Powers), who objects to their style of music. P. J. collars Linda's father and threatens him with a lawsuit. Her father apologizes to the band members and assures them that they will be able to continue. At the benefit, the band plays "The Start of Something Big", energizing the crowd. Bobby attempts to speak with Linda, who is still unhappy with their style of music, but when they launch into a cover of "Let's Twist Again", Linda's father encourages her to join in the dancing and she begins to enjoy it.

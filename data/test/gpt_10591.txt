The Hoko River Formation is a Late Cretaceous geologic formation in the North Island of New Zealand. It preserves fossils dating back to the Cretaceous period and was first described in 1853 by geologist James Hector. The formation is made up of sand, mud, and clay deposits and is around thick. The majority of the fossils that have been found in the Hoko River Formation are from the Campanian stage, dating back to around 83-78 million years ago.   The Hoko River Formation is notable for its many fossilized tree stumps, which can be seen throughout the area. These tree stumps are a result of a period of intense forest growth that took place during the Campanian stage. The Hoko River Formation is also home to a number of other rare fossils, such as an iguana that has been found preserved in mudstone.

In biology, homeostasis is the state of being within a specified range of values. It is a physiological process that maintains equilibrium between the internal environment and the individual's metabolic, hormonal, and neural activities. The term is derived from the Greek words "homo" (meaning "same") and "stasis" (meaning "standing still").  Homeostasis is a cornerstone of physiology, as it ensures that organs and cells maintain their appropriate levels of function by regulating many variables. This can be accomplished through a variety of mechanisms, including feedback mechanisms, feedforward loops, and integrative regulation. In addition, homeostasis interacts with other systems in the body to maintain overall health.  There are several types of homeostasis: thermal homeostasis, fluid balance, blood pressure, acid-base balance, and electrical homeostasis. Each is important for maintaining an organism's health. Thermal homeostasis keeps body temperature within a narrow range; fluid balance regulates the amount of water and other liquids in the body; blood pressure maintains the flow of blood through the vessels; acid-base balance keeps pH levels within a narrow range; and electrical homeostasis keeps the level of ions in the cells within a set range.  The term was first introduced by the French physiologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1809.

Gilles Mureau (also Mureue, as he spelled it in his own hand) was a French painter, printmaker and sculptor. He was born in 1875 in Saint-Étienne, France and died in 1946 in Saint-Cloud, France.  Gilles Mureau was born in Saint-Étienne, France on September 21st, 1875. His early years were spent in the city of his birth, before he relocated to Paris to study at the École des Beaux-Arts. There he met the influential painters Paul Signac and Camille Pissarro, earning the nickname "Mureau" from Pissarro who thought he resembled a bulldog.  Mureau made his debut as a painter in 1900 with a series of watercolors entitled "Vue de la cathédrale de Saint-Étienne". This early work displayed the influence of Pissarro and Signac, and Mureau would continue to draw on their techniques and style for the remainder of his career.  In 1902 Mureau exhibited a series of lithographs entitled "Les Fêtes de la Ville de Lyon". These works are characterized by their bright colors and sharply defined lines, displaying the influence of both Signac and Pissarro.  In 1905 Mureau exhibited a series of paintings entitled "La Baraque à boules" which depicted life in the working class district of Montmartre. This series was influential on the later work of Jean Dubuffet.

Guillaume d'Amiens or Guillaume le Peigneur (floruit 1190sâ€“1230) was a French nobleman and troubadour who dedicated much of his life to courtly love. He is the subject of the first great medieval love poem, the Chanson de Guillaume d'Amiens.  Guillaume was born into a wealthy and influential family in northern France around 1190. He began his career as an army officer, but he soon abandoned military life to pursue a career in poetry. He became one of the most celebrated troubadours of his time, and his poetic works reflect his deep love for women. In 1219 he married Agnes de Poitiers, sister of King Henry II of England. The couple had four children, but all died before they reached adulthood.  In 1230, Guillaume fell ill and died. His funeral was attended by many of his friends and fellow troubadours, who eulogized him as a great poet and lover. His legacy continues to be celebrated today through the works he left behind.

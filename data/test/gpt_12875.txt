Mall Madness is a shopping themed board game for two to four players. The game is a fast-paced, strategic, auction-based game where players are competing to buy and run their own mall.  Players start the game with a hand of cards that represent different shops in their mall. On a turn, each player will choose one of these shops to sell items from. Players then draw cards from the deck to purchase items in the shop, and must also choose an action card that will guide them during the turn.  The goal of the game is to buy as many items as possible at auction, and then sell them at the highest price possible. Players can also build new shops and upgrade existing ones, but this will cost them resources which they will need to earn during the game. The first player to reach $10,000 in total sales (or gain control of all eight shops) wins the game!

The glaucous-winged gull (Larus glaucescens) is a large gull found in North America. This species has a white head, neck, and underparts with a conspicuous black band running from the beak to the tail. The wings are bluish-gray with a pale yellowish band across the primaries. The bill is black, and the legs and feet are black. Juveniles have a yellow bill and head, and they have a white patch on the shoulder where the black band joins the wing. The glaucous-winged gull is found in open areas near water, often in disturbed habitats such as agricultural areas or urban areas.

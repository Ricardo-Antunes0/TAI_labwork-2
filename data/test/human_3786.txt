Eliot, 1917-1932 Study Guide</ref> It was published in 1932 by his employers, Faber & Faber, costing 12/6 (2009: £).  In addition to his poetry, by 1932, Eliot was already accepted as one of English Literature's most important critics. In this position he was instrumental in the reviving interest in the long‐neglected Jacobean playwrights. A Dialogue on Dramatic Poetry was originally an addendum to Eliot's preface to Dryden's Essay of Dramatick Poesie (1928 reprint). Further essays include The Metaphysical Poets (1921) in which Eliot argued that a "dissociation of sensibility" set in...  due to the influence of ... Milton and Dryden. Furthermore the modern poet ‘must be difficult’... ‘to force, to dislocate if necessary, language into his meaning’. Philip Massinger (1920) contains his aphorism "Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal".

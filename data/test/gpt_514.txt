Half-pipe skiing is the sport of riding a ski down a halfpipe, a curved, steep-walled ski jump. The halfpipe is usually 8–10 m (26.2–33.3 ft) wide and 30–50 cm (12.6–19.7 in) deep. Competitors must ski down the pipe as fast as possible, using any combination of tricks and turns to stay ahead of the ski jump's walls.  Half-pipe skiing was developed in the early 1990s in the United States by two skiers, Jamie Anderson and Louie Vito. Anderson is generally credited with inventing the halfpipe, while Vito is credited with popularizing it. The sport has since become popular worldwide, with events held in many different countries.

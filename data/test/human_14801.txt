Sade-Sati is the   years long period of Shani. This astrological phase is much feared by those in India who believe Indian Astrology. This is a period with many challenges, but also a time of great achievements and recognition. Traditional calculation of start and end of Sade Sati The period of Sade-sati starts when Saturn enters the zodiac sign immediately before the zodiac sign of Moon at the time of the birth of the individual. That is, if the Moon sign (Ayamsha) at the time of birth of the native was Taurus, then the Sadesati will begin when Saturn enters sign Aries. The Sadesati will continue while Saturn transits over this sign and the next two signs, i.e. the birth sign and the sign after it. Saturn spends around  years in each sign. To cross these three signs it takes about  years. Thus the name Sadesati which literally means seven and a half.

Paulina Susana Rubio Dosamantes  (; born 17 June 1971) is a Mexican singer. She first achieved recognition as a member of the successful pop group Timbiriche from 1982 through 1991. After leaving Timbiriche, she embarked on a solo career. Referred to as the "Queen of Latin Pop", Rubio has sold over 15 million records, making her one of the best-selling Latin music artists of all-time. Rubio's first two studio albums, La Chica Dorada (1992) and 24 Kilates (1993), were commercial successes and made her then EMI Latin's best-selling Mexican female artist. In the mid-1990s, she adopted a more mature and electronic style for her next two albums, El Tiempo Es Oro (1995) and Planeta Paulina (1996), and made her feature film debut with a starring role in BÃ©same en la Boca (1995). Following a series of concerts with Timbiriche and ending her contract with EMI Latin, Rubio's career was interrupted before the release of her fifth album and first with Universal Music Group, the homonym Paulina (2000), which is critically referred to as her best album. Paulina was an international success and made her the best-selling Latin music artist of the Billboard Year-End (2001-2002). She returned to the top of the charts again with her sixth and seventh albums, the crossover Border Girl (2002) and Pau-Latina (2004), respectively. Rubio garnered critical praise, including nominations for the Grammy Award and Latin Grammy Award. Her next albums, Ananda (2006) and Gran City Pop (2009), were also critically and commercially successful. She followed it with Brava! (2011), which delved into American dance-pop.

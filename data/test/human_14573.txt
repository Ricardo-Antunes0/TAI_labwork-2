Shawnee Methodist Mission is also referred to as the Shawnee Mission today but is most appropriately called the Shawnee Indian Manual Labor Boarding School. In July 1830, Shawnee Tribal leadership formally requested that the US government make arrangements to establish a mission on tribal lands for childhood education. Day schools were then established by several Christian denominations, with the first Methodist school established by missionaries in 1830 in Turner, Kansas to educate children of the Shawnee tribe of Native Americans who had been removed to Kansas.  In June 1838, the Methodist Mission Society, led by Thomas Johnson, requested and received authorization and financial support from the U.S. government to build a large boarding school “mission,” consolidating the training of Indigenous children in manual trades from different tribes, thereby reducing costs through an economy of scale. In 1839, with approval of Shawnee leadership, Shawnee Indians and others labored to build and establish the school along with supporting infrastructure of almost 2000 acres in the heart of the Shawnee Reservation (currently in the City of Fairway in northeast Johnson County). A substantial portion of the construction costs were drawn from the Shawnee Tribe’s treaty funds. In addition, Shawnee treaty funds were used at this school to educate Shawnee children, even if they wanted to go to a different mission school on the tribe’s reservation. The site contained the three large buildings and thirteen smaller ones, with a maximum enrollment of nearly two hundred Indian boys and girls. Although the Shawnee Tribe was the only tribe that provided land for the school, the school was attended by children from all tribes in the region.

The Prisoners (Polish: Aresztanci, also known as Na etapie) is an 1883 oil painting by Polish painter Jacek Malczewski. It depicts a group of Polish political prisoners exiled to Siberia for their participation in the national January Uprising of 1863–1864 against Tsarist Russia. It is now displayed at the National Museum in Warsaw. Background January Uprising began on 22 January 1863 and was aimed at the restoration of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The conflict was the longest lasting insurgency in post-partition Poland and engaged all levels of society. The uprising was suppressed in 1864 and among the many reprisals of the Russian Empire against the insurrectionists were forced deportations to Siberia. Jacek Malczewski, similarly to fellow painter Józef Chełmoński, witnessed the January Uprising as a child, which had exerted a lasting impact on the artist as an adult. He created many paintings forming a significant part of Poland's rich iconography portraying the country's fight for independence during the Age of Partitions and The Prisoners is one of the artist's works directly referring to the fate of Poles sentenced to resettlement in Siberia.

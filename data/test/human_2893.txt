The Melrose Road Bridge is a historic bridge at the western end of Melrose Road in East Windsor, Connecticut.  Built in 1888, it is  one of a small number of surviving 19th-century lenticular pony truss bridge in the state.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.  It has been closed for many years, and lacks stringers and decking. Description and history The Melrose Road Bridge is located in a rural area of northeastern East Windsor, at the western end of Melrose Road, where it would otherwise cross the Scantic River.  This portion of the river is now part of Scantic River State Park.  The bridge now consists of a wrought iron lenticular truss structure, spanning the river and mounted on brownstone abutments. The truss elements are joined by pins.  The bridge measures  long and  wide, and would be capable of carrying one lane of traffic if rehabilitated.  Guardrails have been welded across each of the truss's ends to impede access to the structure, which lacks any sort of decking.

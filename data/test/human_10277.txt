An outstanding junior, Jetta was twice named in the Under 18 All-Australian Team as well as being adjudged the joint winner of the Kevin Sheehan Medal, awarded to the Best Player in Division 1 at the Under 16 National Championships. He was also a graduate of the AIS-AFL Academy in 2005. The speedy forward was drafted by the Bombers with the priority selection (18th overall) in the 2006 AFL Draft from South Fremantle. He was drafted as a player renowned for outstanding pace, good foot skill and terrific vision on the ground. He made his AFL debut in the opening round of the 2007 season, along with another of the club's 2006 recruits, Alwyn Davey. Jetta went on to play the following 3 matches before being sidelined by a groin complaint. Despite returning to play with Essendon's VFL affiliate, the Bendigo Bombers, this injury ultimately ended his 2007 season.

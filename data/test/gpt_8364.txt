Pieter de Groot (28 March 1615 â€“ 2 October 1675) was a Dutch Golden Age painter and draughtsman.  Pieter de Groot was born in Utrecht, Netherlands, the son of a miller. He began studying painting with his father, and then moved to Amsterdam, where he became a pupil of Rembrandt van Rijn. After completing his training, he worked in Deventer for a year before travelling to Italy, where he spent about five years painting mainly for the court of the Duke of Mantua. He returned to the Netherlands in 1651 and settled in Amsterdam, where he spent the rest of his life.  De Groot is considered one of the most important Dutch painters of the seventeenth century. He is particularly noted for his portraits and historical scenes, as well as for his skill in capturing light and atmosphere. His paintings are popular in art galleries. De Groot died in Amsterdam at the age of 71.

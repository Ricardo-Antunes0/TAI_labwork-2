Dalem was a title for the kings of the ancient kingdom of Raja in what is now northwestern India. The kingdom was located in the region now known as Jammu and Kashmir.  The kingdom emerged around the middle of the first millennium BC and was ruled by a line of Dalem kings. The kingdom reached its peak around the fourth century BC, when it was one of the most powerful states in northern India. However, by the first century AD, the kingdom had been reduced to a minor regional power. It was eventually annexed by the Gupta Empire in the fourth century AD.

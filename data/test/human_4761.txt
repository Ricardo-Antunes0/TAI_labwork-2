Phrynocephalus vlangalii, also known as the Qinghai toad-headed agama, the Ching Hai toadhead agama, the Pylzow's toadhead agama, or gecko toadhead agama, is a species of viviparous agamid lizard endemic to the Tibetan Plateau in China. This lizard lives in burrows at high elevations of 2,000 to 4,600 meters. It is also known for its aggression, especially between females during mating season since females usually only have one mate. P. vlangalii curls its tail and shows a patch on its underbelly as defense displays against conspecifics. This lizard also has a variety of gut microbiota that help perform metabolic and biological functions depending on the altitude at which the lizard lives. Description  As a small lizard, P. vlangalii can grow up to 80 mm from snout to vent. Sexual dimorphism is present in this species and most evident among adults. Adult males tend to have larger heads and tail lengths while adult females have larger bodies and abdomen lengths. Males and females are also distinguishable by their tail-tip badges: males have black tail-tips and females have orange tail-tips. Both males and females display their tail-tip badges and underbelly patches as a method of defending their territory against rival lizards. There is a positive correlation between a lizard's body size and temperature, air pressure, and active season length, demonstrated by differences in the body size of P. vlangalii among different elevations in the Tibetan plateau. This is because as the elevation increases, air temperature and pressure decrease. To avoid hypoxia, or lack of oxygen to the body, these lizards have smaller bodies to help maintain a constant body temperature.

LTE-M (LTE-MTC [Machine Type Communication]), which includes LTE-FDD (LTE-FDMA [Frequency Division Duplexing], LTE-TDMA [Time Division Duplexing], and LTE-UFDMA [Ultra-Wideband Direct Mode]) is a 3GPP telecommunications standard for high-speed mobile communications. It is based on the Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) terrestrial radio frequency band and uses OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) with MIMO (Multiple In, Multiple Out) and SC-FDMA (Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiplexing) for multiplexing.  LTE-M has been designed to provide increased spectral efficiency over LTE, with up to 100 Mbit/s downlink and 50 Mbit/s uplink speeds. In addition, it introduces new features such as support for Cat 16 (4G) services, which are capable of reaching download speeds of up to 1 Gbit/s. Finally, LTE-M is also backward compatible with LTE, allowing it to coexist with existing LTE networks.

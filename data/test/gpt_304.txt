Zero Critical (also known as Satin Rift) is a novel technique used in audiovisual editing and production. It is a way of creating an image or video with no visible lines or artifacts, resulting in a smooth and seamless image.  The technique is made possible by using very low levels of noise, or grain, in an image. This can be achieved by reducing the amount of digital noise removal applied to an image, or by deliberately introducing noise into an image to create the desired effect.  Zero Critical is often used in movie and video production to create clean and smooth footage, without the use of traditional editing techniques such as fades or cuts. By eliminating the visible lines and artifacts that can occur with editing, Zero Critical footage can often look more natural and fluid than traditional footage.

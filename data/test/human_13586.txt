George Colin Ogilvie - Junior (12 May 1899 – 9 February 1957) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Richmond in the Victorian Football League (VFL), and for Footscray, Port Melbourne and Yarraville in the Victorian Football Association (VFA). He joined Richmond from Echuca in late 1920, and played in two games – the club's round 18 match and its semi-final – to high acclaim, before his permit was revoked after it was determined that he was tied to 's district and was ineligible to play for Richmond; Ogilvie had lived in Essendon's district prior to the World War I, and although he served almost three years in France during World War I, the time away was not long enough for Essendon's residential claim to him to have expired. Consequently, he missed Richmond's Grand Final victory. The following year, Ogilvie crossed to VFA club Footscray without a clearance, earning him a disqualification from the VFL. He spent one year at Footscray.

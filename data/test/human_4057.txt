"Feelings" is a song by South African singer Zonke from her third studio album Ina Ethe (2011). It was released as the parent record's second single on 12 July 2012 through TMP Entertainment. Solely written and produced by the singer herself, "Feelings" is a jazz song that is accompanied by a combination of African drums and beats. The single was nominated for "Record of the Year" at the 2013 South African Music Awards, but lost to "Kulungile Baba" by Sifiso Ncwane in the category. The accompanying music video was directed and produced by Shawn Borcherding and won the recognition of "Most Gifted Female Video" at the Channel O Music Video Awards, also in 2013. Zonke performed "Feelings" live on several occasions, including as part of the pre-show for select Lionel Richie concerts and during her 2013 Give and Take Live Tour. The live rendition would later be included on her first live album, Give and Take Live (2013).

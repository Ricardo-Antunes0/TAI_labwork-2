Astropecten polyacanthus, the sand sifting starfish or polyacanthus, is a species of starfish in the family Astropectenidae. It is found in the Indo-Pacific region where it lives on sandy bottoms at depths from 0 to 100 metres. It can grow to a size of 1.5 metres. The animal has five arms and a disc-shaped body with a smooth surface. The colour varies from light brown to dark brown and the animal can be distinguished from other starfish by its lack of an operculum and its ability to sand filter food from the water.

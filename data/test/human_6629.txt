A passenger train is a train used to transport people along a railroad line. These trains may consist of unpowered passenger railroad cars (also known as coaches or carriages) hauled by one or more locomotives, or may be self-propelled; self propelled passenger trains are known as multiple units or railcars. Passenger trains travel between stations or depots, where passengers may board and disembark. In most cases, passenger trains operate on a fixed schedule and have priority over freight trains. Passenger trains may be made up of a number of passenger cars hauled by one or more locomotives, or may be made up of self-propelled railcars.  Car design and the general safety of passenger trains have dramatically evolved over time, making travel by rail remarkably safe.  Some passenger trains, both long-distance and short-distance, use bi-level (double-decker) cars to carry more passengers per train.  Passenger trains hauled by locomotives are more expensive to operate than multiple units, but have a higher passenger capacity.

Ponte Sant'Angelo, originally the Aelian Bridge or Pons Aelius, is a Roman stone bridge in Rome, Italy, that connected the Vatican City with the Trastevere district. It was erected by the governor of Africa Proconsul Lucius Aelius Gallus in 184 BC as part of the public works of the city to mark the victory of his troops over the Gauls.  The bridge is named after Saint Angelus, one of the seven original apostles of Jesus. The bridge is also known as the Ponte Sisto because it links the Piazza di Sisto with the Piazza Navona. The bridge was severely damaged by a flood in 1966 and was completely rebuilt between 1976 and 1982.  The bridge is currently undergoing restorations that are expected to last until 2020.

Gerd Lüdemann (July 5, 1946–May 23, 2021)  was a German biblical scholar and historian. He taught first Jewish Christianity and Gnosticism at McMaster University, Canada (1977–1979) and then New Testament at Vanderbilt Divinity School, U.S.A. (1979–1982). In 1983, he was appointed to the chair in New Testament Studies in the Evangelical Theological Faculty at the University of Göttingen (Georg-August-Universität Göttingen), Germany, and taught New Testament until 1999. In the same year, his chair in “New Testament” was renamed “History and Literature of Early Christianity” in the Institute for Special Research (Institut für Spezialforschungen) at the University. Thus, he was removed from the professorship to train future Protestant pastors and stayed in the new department until his retirement in 2011. Early life and education  Gerd Lüdemann was born on July 5, 1946, in Visselhövede, a town in the district of Rotenburg an der Wümme in Lower Saxony, Germany.  His parents were not poor but they lived modestly; his mother was religious and a devout churchgoer. Lüdemann was a born again Christian by conversion at a “tent mission” of his home town, Visselhövede, in May 1963.

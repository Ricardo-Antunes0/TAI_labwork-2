As of the 2010 census, the population was 17,837.  Jersey Village was founded in 1887 as a small farming community on the banks of the San Jacinto River. The community's name is derived from a Jersey cowshed that operated on land now within Jersey Village. The Jersey Cowshed was a stop on the Buffalo Bayou Navigation Company's Galveston-Houston line. The stop served as an agricultural market and shipping point for local farmers.  The Jersey Village post office opened in 1888 and remained open until 1982. The Jersey Village Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.  In the early 1990s, development in Jersey Village increased rapidly with the construction of residential subdivisions and commercial centers. This rapid growth has resulted in significant changes to the character of the community, including loss of some historic buildings and a decline in population density.  Today, Jersey Village is a diverse community that is home to families and businesses of all ages and backgrounds.

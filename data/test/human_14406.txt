The Cyrix Cx486SLC is a x86 microprocessor that was developed by Cyrix. It was one of Cyrix's first CPU offerings, released after years of selling math coprocessors that competed with Intel's units and offered better performance at a comparable or lower price. It was announced in March of 1992, and released 2 months later in May, with a price of $119. It was priced competitively against the Intel 486SX, causing Intel to lower the price of their chip from $286 to $119 in just days. Specifications  The 486SLC is based on the i386SX bus, and was intended as an entry-level chip to compete with the Intel 386SX and 486SX. SGS-Thomson and Texas Instruments manufactured the 486SLC for Cyrix. Texas Instruments also sold it under its own name as TX486SLC. Later, Texas Instruments also released their own version of the chip, the TI486SXLC which featured 8kB internal cache vs 1kB in the original Cyrix design. These chips went under the name Potomac, and Cyrix would receive full royalties for them. The similarly named IBM 486SLC, 486SLC2, 486SLC3 (16-bit external bus version of IBM 486DLC aka Blue Lightning) and IBM 386SLC are often confused with the Cyrix chips, but are not related and instead based on an Intel CPU core.

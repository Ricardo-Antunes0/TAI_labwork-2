Feeler was supposed to have been the Toadies's follow-up album to the critically acclaimed debut Rubberneck; however, its release was denied by Interscope Records. In June 2010, the band announced that they had re-entered the studio to "rediscover" and re-record the album. This nine-song version was released on August 10, 2010. 1998 recordings In 1997, the band decided to end their Rubberneck tour and began work on their follow-up album. In the beginning of 1998, the band entered Arlyn Studios and Pedernales Studio with producer Paul Leary. They recorded 15 songs in consideration for the album, initially planning for a fall 1998 release. By August, due to 'scheduling problems', the album, which now had the tentative title Feeler, was still not mixed or mastered, although there was still hope that it would be released in early 1999. During this time, the band was considering adding more songs for consideration for the album, including the new songs "You'll Come Down" and "Trust Game", as well as older songs including "Cut Me Out" and "Broke Down Stupid". Interscope Records did not approve the finished product, and rejected its release. The band went back into the studio, salvaging some of the songs recorded during the Feeler sessions, and eventually released their second full-length album Hell Below/Stars Above in the spring of 2001.

Caerlaverock Castle is a moated triangular castle in the south-west of Scotland, in the county of Dumfries and Galloway. The castle occupies a commanding position on a rocky outcrop overlooking the Solway Firth, and is surrounded by a curtain wall.  The first castle on the site was probably built by the Romans, and was known as Castrum Rotomagum, after the River Maguma which flows close by. The earliest recorded mention of the castle is from 1113, when it was held by King David I of Scotland. In 1165, King Henry II of England besieged and captured it, but he later had to give it back to David in exchange for other Scottish territories.  The castle changed hands several times during the Middle Ages, until it was captured by Sir William Douglas in 1455. Douglas made extensive modifications to the castle, including the addition of a keep and a new outer wall. The castle remained in Douglas' hands until 1488, when it was seized by James IV of Scotland. In 1512, James V of Scotland gave it to his half-brother Francis I of France in exchange for French assistance in his war against England.  The castle changed hands again in 1543, when it was captured by the English under Sir Thomas Howard. Howard made further modifications to the castle, including the addition of two new towers. The castle remained under English control until 1547, when it was recaptured by Scottish forces under James Hamilton. Hamilton later gave it to Cardinal Beaton

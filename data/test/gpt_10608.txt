The whorls are convex, the suture well impressed. The protoconch is small, smooth and oblong. The teleoconch contains 5 to 6 whorls, of which the first two are well rounded, flattening rapidly towards the apex and ending in a rather sharp point. The subsequent whorls are more or less sharply angulated at the shoulder and form an acute angle with the preceding whorl. They are also convex, but less so than the preceding whorl and gradually become more granular on the base. The aperture is oval-shaped, wide at its base and narrowing gradually towards the apex. The columella is moderately strong, curved and notched near its summit. The inner lip is thin, elastic and slightly concave above. This species is light brown above and white below, with a few brownish spots scattered over the surface.  This species is found in the Indian Ocean off East Africa; in the Pacific Ocean off New Zealand; in the Atlantic Ocean off Senegal;

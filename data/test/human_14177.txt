The Floating Bethel was a river going vessel that planted churches and served as a platform for the missionary work of Rev. George T. Clayton, his wife Lizzie, B.F. Roe and Herbert M. Riggle in the early Church of God movement during the 1890s. Origins  The Bethel was an unpowered barge; described also as a "converted rolling mill paddler", that was converted to a three hundred seat chapel. It operated in the northern Ohio Valley starting in In the fall of 1893. Clayton bought a sunken barge and for several years conducted evangelistic work on the Ohio river. The evangelists that worked on the barge were representatives of the Church of God (Anderson, Indiana). The barge was paid for by Riggle who used his inheritance to start the project. Riggle worked on the project for a time until one of his children nearly fell into the river. There was no financial collection made during the services held during this ministry; volunteers paid for the expenses. The mission was planned to last for 5 years with stops planned for various lengths.

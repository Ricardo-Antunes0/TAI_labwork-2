Newman's Energy Machine was a DC motor-driven device invented by American engineer and inventor George H. Newman in the early 1920s. It was a precursor to modern electric powertrains and used rotating magnets to produce rotary motion.  Newman's Energy Machine was a DC motor-driven device invented by American engineer and inventor George H. Newman in the early 1920s. It was a precursor to modern electric powertrains and used rotating magnets to produce rotary motion. The device used a commutator, which allowed it to be powered by direct current (DC), making it an important step in the development of electrical machines. Newman's Energy Machine was widely used in early electric vehicles, including the first automobile, the Stanley Steamer.

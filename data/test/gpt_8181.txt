Main aur Charles  is a 2015 Indian Hindi-language romantic comedy film directed by Siddharth Malhotra and produced by Ronnie Screwvala. The film stars Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor Khan in the lead roles and is a remake of the Telugu film Oppam starring R. Sarathkumar and Tamannaah.  The film is about a middle-class couple, Charles (Shahid Kapoor) and Geeta (Kareena Kapoor Khan), who are trying to conceive a child. Charles is often berated by his friends for his low income, but he remains hopeful that one day he will be able to provide for his family in the same way as they have done for him. Geeta is a stay-at-home mom who feels constrained by her traditional Hindu values, but she gradually starts to adopt more modern attitudes as she gets closer to Charles. When Charles learns that he may have a genetic disorder that may prevent him from fathering children, he begins to focus on his relationship with Geeta and their future together.    Main aur Charles tells the story of an average middle-class Indian couple who are struggling to conceive a child - thanks in part to Charles' low income. Despite this, they remain hopeful and enjoy spending time together, learning about each other and growing closer in the process.

Guillermo de Torre (Madrid, 1900 – Buenos Aires, 1975) was a Spanish painter, sculptor and printmaker.  He was the son of the sculptor and painter Domingo de Torre. After studying at the Escuela Superior de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid, he travelled to Paris, where he worked with Cubists and Surrealists such as André Breton. In the late 1920s he settled in Buenos Aires, where he became one of the leading exponents of Abstract Expressionism. He is best known for his paintings and prints based on a simplified form of abstraction, characterized by their use of bright colours and strong lines.

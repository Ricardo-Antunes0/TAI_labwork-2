In the fields of digital electronics and computer science, a multi-channel memory architecture is a computer system design that incorporates multiple levels of cache memory, typically with different levels of access latency. It is also called a multi-cache architecture or a hierarchical memory architecture.  Multi-channel memory architectures offer improved performance over single-channel architectures by reducing the number of datapaths required to fetch data from memory, and by allowing more than one processor to access data simultaneously. Multi-channel architectures also improve performance by hiding latency variations among the channels.

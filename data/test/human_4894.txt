Count Sesto is the title borne by the current head of the existing noble family of that name, of ancient Genoese and subsequently Sicilian origin. The comital family traces its origins as a collateral branch of the patrician Spinola family of Genova, subsequently created Marquis and then Duke of Sesto and Marquis of Venafro (sometimes called Benafro).  The Spinola, Doria, Grimaldi and Fieschi were the principal four families of Genoa, rivals for authority within the republic of Genoa in the 13th and 14th centuries.  The Spinola family were allied to the Squarciafico family (created Marquess of Galatone), the Princes of Belmonte, and the Counts of Galerata.  Distinguished members of the Spinola family include the celebrated general Ambrogio Spinola, Duke and Marquis of Sesto (1569-1630), his son Filippo Spinola (1596–1659) and Ambrose Spinola de la Cerda y Colonna, 5th Marquis of los Balbases and Duke of Sesto (1701–1757), all of whom were Knights of the Order of the Golden Fleece.  All bore the title of Marquis or Duke of Sesto, as well as the title of Duke of San Severino, later to become celebrated by Stendhal.

"Searching" is the 150th episode of the ABC television series, Desperate Housewives. It is the sixteenth episode of the show's seventh season and was broadcast on March 6, 2011. Plot Gabrielle Solis (Eva Longoria) sees Lee McDermott (Kevin Rahm) teaching Jenny Hunter-McDermott to play the violin. Gabrielle finds out that Jenny will be performing in a school talent show and is rather impressed at Jenny's abilities. However, Gabrielle questions and downgrades Lee's form of parentingâ€”forcing his child to do many things to make him proud. Angered, Lee challenges Gabrielle that both Jenny and Juanita Solis (Madison De La Garza) should compete against each other at the talent show to see whose form of parenting is better. After agreeing to this, Gabrielle gets worried when Juanita seems to spend her time eating ice cream and her ability (or talent, as she sees it) to make farting noises with her armpit. Annoyed, Gabrielle forces Juanita to try tap dancing in the talent show. A few days later, Gabrielle's ongoing pressurizing finally takes its toll on Juanita who decides to give up after having been very exhausted from the daily training. Gabrielle then convinces her to not let her talent go to waste and Juanita gives in. At the talent show, while Gabrielle and Lee exchange smirks and underestimating remarks, Gabrielle is shocked that Juanita's practice routine is very odd and untalented and to prevent being embarrassed when Juanita gets to perform onstage, Gabrielle purposely hides Juanita's tap dancing shoes under a heater, forcing Juanita to drop out of the talent show. Gabrielle is then impressed at Bob and Lee applauding and encouraging Jenny after her performance and realizes that she, herself, is the one who has no good parenting skills and is surprised at Juanita's disappointment at not being able to perform. Just before the talent show ends, Gabrielle gains the courage to have Juanita perform after revealing where her shoes are and as Juanita performs onstage, a proud Gabrielle smiles at her daughter's accomplishment.

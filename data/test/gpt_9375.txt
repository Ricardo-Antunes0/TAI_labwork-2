Neurophysin II is a carrier protein with a molecular weight of about 70,000 daltons. It is produced exclusively by the human brain and is responsible for the transportation of neurotransmitters between cells. Neurophysin II has been shown to interact with a number of different proteins, including the NMDA receptor, calcium channels, and phospholipase C.  Neurophysin II was first identified in 1992 and was initially thought to be a protein responsible for the transport of neurotransmitters between cells. However, in 2001, it was shown to interact with a number of different proteins, including the NMDA receptor, calcium channels, and phospholipase C. This interaction is important, as it allows for the proper transmission of signals between cells. Neurophysin II is also important in the development and function of the brain. It is produced exclusively by the human brain and is responsible for the transportation of neurotransmitters between cells. Neurophysin II has been shown to play an important role in the development of synaptic connections and in the function of neurons.

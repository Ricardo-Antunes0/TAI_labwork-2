The Intercity Express (commonly known as ICE) is a high-speed train service operated by Deutsche Bahn in Germany and Austria. It is the fastest train service in Germany and Austria, with a top speed of 320 km/h (200 mph).  The IntercityExpress is one of the few high-speed rail services in the world that operates on standard gauge tracks. The trains are made up of three classes: first, second and business. Each class has its own seating and sleeping arrangements.  The IntercityExpress was originally conceived in the early 1970s as an upgraded version of the then existing InterCity network. Construction started in 1974 and the first trains ran on the network in 1979. The original concept was for hourly services between major German cities, but this was later changed to a two-hourly frequency due to high demand. In 1994, ICE services were extended to Paris, making it the first non-European high-speed rail service to reach that city.

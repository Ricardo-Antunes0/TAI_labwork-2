The   or sea ban was a set of Japanese domestic regulations governing the conduct of foreigners in Japan during World War II. The regulations were introduced on November 25, 1941, and were in effect until September 2, 1945.  The term "haijin" is a Japanese word which means "foreigner." The regulations were introduced to restrict the activities of foreigners in Japan during World War II, as Japan was engaged in a war against foreign countries. The regulations were based on the premise that foreigners were not loyal to Japan and would therefore be a threat to national security. The regulations prohibited foreigners from owning land, working in certain professions, or living in specific areas of Japan. They also required foreigners to register with the Japanese government and carry a registration card. The regulations were enforced by the Japanese police force, known as the kosei keibu.

Mixed-member proportional representation (MMP or MMPR) is a voting system used in multi-member constituencies in which members are elected by proportional representation. In an MMP election, each voter casts two votes, one for a constituency representative and one for the party list. The constituency representative is typically a member of the incumbent party, while the list candidates are from all parties competing in the election.   MMP was originally developed in the Netherlands, where it has been used since 2002. It has been advocated as a way to increase representation of minorities and women, and to reduce the influence of party leaders and elite factions. MMP has been used in several European Union member states, including Germany, Italy, and Sweden.

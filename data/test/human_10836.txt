Jungledyret Hugo is a Danish media franchise featuring the cartoon adventures of a little primate named Hugo. It was created by Danish author and filmmaker Flemming Quist MÃ¸ller from a lullaby he made for his son, and later evolved into a full-length animated feature, produced at A. Film A/S. The franchise currently consists of two traditionally animated features, an animated television series, books, music album, and a third film animated in CGI. The first two films were translated, edited, and released in the United States on a single DVD in 1998 by Miramax Family. The first movie was released as Go Hugo Go and the second movie was released as Hugo The Movie Star. The third film was released on region 1 DVD on August 12, 2014 under the title "Amazon Jack".  A CD-ROM side-scrolling platform game for the PC based on the first movie was also made in 1995 and released in Scandinavia.

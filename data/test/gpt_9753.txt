The Lunenburg campaign was executed by the British Army during the Seven Years' War. The British Army marched from Derby to Lunenburg, Nova Scotia in 1758 in order to remove the French forces from the area and to fortify Halifax.  The campaign began on July 9, 1758, and ended on July 27. The British Army was successful in removing the French forces from the area and fortifying Halifax. The campaign was also significant because it marked the first time that a British army had campaigned in Nova Scotia.

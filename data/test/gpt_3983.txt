Mary Fedden, OBE RA RWA (14 August 1916 â€“ 17 July 2006) was a British artist.  Fedden was born in 1916 in Liverpool, England to Scottish parents. She attended the Liverpool Institute of Art from 1934 to 1937 and the Royal College of Art from 1937 to 1940.  Fedden's early work was Surrealist in style, but she later turned to more conventional painting. Her work often features women in traditional dress, or in abstract or landscape settings. She has been called "one of the most important British artists of the 20th century".  Fedden was made an OBE in 1976 and a RA in 1984. She died in 2006.

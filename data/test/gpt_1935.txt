Robert Laurence Binyon, CH (10 August 1869 â€“ 13 October 1941) was an English poet, writer, and critic.

Born in West London to a successful family of wine merchants, Binyon spent much of his early life in France where his father had been appointed consul. Returning to England in 1892, Binyon attended Eton College before reading Classics at Balliol College, Oxford. There, he became friends with W.B. Yeats and other members of the Irish Literary Revival. After leaving Oxford in 1894, he spent a year travelling in Europe and the Middle East.  In 1896, Binyon married Agnes Mary Russell; they would have two sons and one daughter. In 1897 he began writing for the London Evening Standard, and two years later he became poetry editor of the magazine. In 1902 he was made a Companion of Honour.  In 1908, Binyon left London for the French Riviera where he lived until his death in 1941. He was a regular contributor to Punch and other magazines throughout his career. His final book of poems, After Long Silence (1941), was published posthumously.

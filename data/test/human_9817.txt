The Leighton Brothers (alt. "Leighton and Leighton") was the name of a vaudeville performance team consisting of brothers Frank Leighton and Bert Leighton..  They also composed various songs, most notably "Steamboat Bill," the tune used in the Disney animated short, Steamboat Willie. Biography  Born to Irish immigrants, the Leighton Brothers grew up in Decatur, Illinois during the latter part of the 19th century. Frank Leighton was the first of the brothers to enter show business, joining a Medicine Show in 1897 and then the Burt Sheppard Minstrel Show in 1898. Bert joined Milt G. Barlow's minstrel group in 1899. The brothers came together for the first time in 1900, joining Vogle and Deming Minstrels. The duo found success as both blackface performers and vaudeville performers for the next few years, culminating in their joining of the Lew Dockstader minstrel group in 1904. The Leighton Brothers were invited to perform on the Orpheum Circuit, highlighting their original music as well as their new compositions of popular songs. Frank Leighton died in 1927, after which Bert went into real estate. Bert died in 1964.

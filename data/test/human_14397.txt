The Snow Bowl is the nickname of a National Football League game played on December 1, 1985, between the Green Bay Packers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin. It is known for its heavy snow. Only 19,856 were in attendance, with over 36,000 "no-shows", the most in Packers history (though due to the game selling out well in advance, it was not blacked out on local television, nor has any Packers home game since 1973 been blacked out, with one exception, due to a sell-out streak dating back to the early 1960s). About two-thirds of the stadium was empty.  of snow fell before the game and another  fell during the game. The game itself saw the Packers dominate the Buccaneers en route to a 21â€“0 victory. Despite four turnovers, the Packers offense gained 512 total yards on 31 first downs, with the Buccaneers recording only 65 yards on 5 first downs. Packers wide receiver James Lofton received passes totaling over 100 yards from quarterback Lynn Dickey by halftime. Packers defensive end Alphonso Carreker sacked Buccaneers quarterback and future Pro Football Hall of Fame enshrinee Steve Young a then team-record four times. It was Young's second game in the league after he left the USFL.

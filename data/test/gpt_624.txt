Gentry (from Old French genterie, from gentil, meaning 'kind, courteous') is a social rank in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries. The term usually refers to hereditary landed aristocrats.  The term derives from the Old French gentil, meaning 'kind, courteous'. It originally referred to the feudal class of landed nobles who were not part of the medieval English nobility. However, over time it came to be used more generally to describe any landed aristocrat, regardless of their feudal or English origins.  Today, the term gentry is often used to describe those who are considered to be of good breeding and who have a high level of education. It is sometimes used as a synonym for aristocracy, but this is not always the case. For example, there are many aristocrats who do not consider themselves to be gentry.

Darüşşafaka Society, the first non-governmental organization in Turkish history in the field of education, was founded in 1863 with the mission of providing “equity in education.” Bright and talented children who have lost one of their parents and who have limited financial resources become eligible to study at Darüşşafaka after passing a competitive exam when they are ten years old, and Darüşşafaka provides them access to quality education at international standards. In its 150 years of existence, Darüşşafaka has maintained its position to be the only school in Turkey with the specific mission of providing equity in education. Today, at Darüşşafaka, 954 children from 68 different provinces of the country receive boarding co-education in English with a full scholarship from the 5th grade until high school graduation. Spending 24 hours and 7 days a week at Darüşşafaka, their students not only receive a high quality education but also develop their personal skills and social orientation that enable them to become leaders in different segments of the society, nationally and internationally.

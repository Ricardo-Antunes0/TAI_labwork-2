Moisés Sánchez Parra (born September 21, 1980 in Palma de Mallorca) is a retired amateur Spanish Greco-Roman wrestler, who competed in the men's welterweight category. He represented his nation Spain at the 2004 Summer Olympics and later capped his sporting career in 2005 with a silver and bronze at the Mediterranean Games and European Championships. Before his retirement from wrestling in 2010, Sanchez trained full-time for Budokan Wrestling Club in Palma de Mallorca under his coach Eusebio Capel. Sanchez qualified for the Spanish squad in the men's 66 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Earlier in the process, he finished second at the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Tashkent, Uzbekistan to guarantee his spot on the returning Spanish wrestling team after a 12-year hiatus. He lost two straight matches each to Kyrgyzstan's Kanatbek Begaliev (1–9) and Iran's Parviz Zeidvand (1–3) that left him on the bottom of the prelim pool, placing eighteenth in the final standings. As two wrestlers were both disqualified by a forfeit in the fifth-place match, Sanchez's position was upgraded to sixteenth.

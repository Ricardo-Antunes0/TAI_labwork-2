Special Temporary Authority (STA)  in U.S. federal law is an authorization granted by the President of the United States to a Federal Officer or employee to carry out certain duties or functions for a limited period of time. The authority may be granted for a specific purpose, such as during a national emergency. The President may also delegate the authority to an individual or group.  STA is typically used when the head of an agency cannot fulfill his or her duties because of an event outside of their control, such as a natural disaster. In order to allow the agency head to return to their full duties, an STA is issued that allows the officer or employee to carry out their duties for a set period of time. The duration of the authority can range from short-term, like three months, to long-term, like three years.

Sarah Goodridge (February 5, 1788 â€“ December 28, 1853; also referred to as Sarah Goodrich) was an American painter who specialized in portrait miniatures.  She was the older sister of Elizabeth Goodridge, also an American miniaturist. Life Goodridge was born in Templeton, Massachusetts, the sixth child and third daughter of Ebenezer Goodridge and his wife Beulah Childs. At an early age, she began drawing and showed an aptitude for art. Women's educational opportunities were limited at the time and where Goodridge lived, so she was largely a self-taught artist. She attended the local district school. Her early sketches of people around her were on birch bark since she lacked the resources to purchase paper. She stayed with her brother, William M. Goodrich, for a few months in Milton, and attended a boarding school there.  She also got a few drawing lessons in Boston where she accompanied her brother.  In Boston, she also met Gilbert Stuart who took an interest in her work.

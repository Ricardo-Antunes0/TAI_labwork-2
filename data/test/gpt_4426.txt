KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is a database of genes and genomes that is jointly developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the genomes projects of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, the JGI, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. KEGG is a freely accessible database that contains information about the function of proteins and genes from a variety of organisms, including plants, animals, and microorganisms.  KEGG was created in 1997 as a resource for scientists to share information about the proteins and genes found in various organisms. The database has since been used to study a wide range of topics, including diseases, genetics, and pharmacology. KEGG also provides users with tools to search for specific proteins or genes.  As of February 2016, KEGG contained more than 5.3 million entries, including information on more than 2.7 million proteins and 3.1 million genes.

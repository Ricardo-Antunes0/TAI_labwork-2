Disgorge Mexico is the eighth album by Canadian grindcore band Fuck the Facts. It is their second album on Relapse Records from a three-album contract with the label. The instruments were recorded from the 6th to the 17th of August 2007 at Liverpool Court Studios in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The vocals were recorded in November 2007 at Fuck the Facts own home studio (The Tower of Self Medication Studio). The album was mixed and mastered at CB Audio in Winnipeg from December 2007 until March 2008. An enhanced portion of the CD includes a story accounting the events leading up to the writing of the album. There is also a video, "High Street," which was created by David Hall (who also directed the video for "The Sound of Your Smashed Head") which features music by the band. A studio video and audio journal from the road trip are also included.

The subterminal fascia is slightly waved to vein 2 where it is constricted, then inwardly oblique to the inner margin at one half. The terminal band is chamois edged with fuscous-black. The hindwings are concolorons with the forewings, the postmedial fascia forming on the forewings is continuations of the postmedial and subterminal fasciae which join on the median nervure and continue as a single band to the inner margin.

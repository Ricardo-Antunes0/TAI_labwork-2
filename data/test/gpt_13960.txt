The Schreyer Honors College (or SHC) is a selective, undergraduate honors program at the University of Rochester in upstate New York. The college is named for Claremont Schreyer, who donated $5 million to the university to create it in 2002.  The SHC was designed to provide an enriched academic experience for talented and highly motivated students who have achieved outstanding academic achievement. The college enrolls about 100 students each year and offers a wide range of opportunities, including access to faculty advisors and resources not available to other students on campus.  The SHC has been nationally recognized for its innovative approach to undergraduate education and its dedication to providing a unique educational experience to its students. In 2016, the Princeton Review ranked the SHC as one of the best undergraduate honors programs in the United States.

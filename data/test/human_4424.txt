The Owens-Rogers Museum, was the home of Hollywood screenwriter and producer Lela Rogers and is the birthplace and childhood home of the American actress, dancer, and singer, Ginger Rogers. The home was a tourist attraction and museum and is located in Independence, Missouri, United States, at 100 W Moore Street. This small craftsman style bungalow was built between 1906 and 1910 by Oscar Mindrup, a local real estate investor, banker, and city councilman. This site is the birthplace of Hollywood film actress/dancer Ginger Rogers. Virginia Katherine McMath (Ginger) was born on July 16, 1911 to Lela Owens McMath, who was estranged from her husband. The house is no longer under the control of the museum, which had to close in May of 2020. The owners have plans to create a digital online version of the Museum in 2020. Usage  Lela Owens-McMath rented the home and she and Ginger likely lived here for approximately four years. Lela insisted on having her baby at home because she lost her first child in a hospital when the doctor used forceps. She obtained employment as a typist on July 15 at the Sand Company, promising to appear for duty in early August. On her way home from the job interview, Lela went into labor and had to walk home while doubling over in pain. She stopped at a drugstore to call the doctor and met him at the house. The next day, Ginger was born.

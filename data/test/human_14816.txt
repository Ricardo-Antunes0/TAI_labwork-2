Orote Field is a former air base in the United States territory of Guam built by the Empire of Japan with Chamorro forced labor during the Japanese occupation of Guam (1941-1944). It is separate from the Marine Corps amphibious airplane base at located at Sumay village that was operational from 1921 to 1931. Following the liberation of Guam in 1944, the U.S. military repaired the field for further use in the Pacific War. Located on Naval Base Guam, Orote Field was largely abandoned after World War II except for occasional training exercises. One major event in 1975 was Operation New Life, when a tent city for tens of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees was erected at the field. The field was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. History  On August 6, 1941, Naval Governor George McMillin sent a letter reporting surveys indicating that the Orote Peninsula could sustain a 4500-by-400 foot landplane runway. However, the U.S. did not actually start construction of such a runway. However, the Japanese also recognized the suitability of the location. During the Japanese occupation of Guam, villages were required to supply levies of able bodied men to work on airfields and other defense projects. Orote Field was the first of the Japanese airfields on Guam to be completed by Chamorro laborers, largely by hand, in 1943.

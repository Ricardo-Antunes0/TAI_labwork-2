San Jerónimo is a volcano in Argentina. It is located  from San Antonio de los Cobres and the lava flows are visible from the road. Also known as San Gerónimo, it is a monogenetic volcano like Negro de Chorrillos and with it part of the geological Piedras Blancas Formation. The volcano has a cone with three craters and reaches an elevation of , which covers an area of about . It developed on top of ignimbrites of Miocene age of the Aguas Calientes caldera and is formed by lava, lava bombs and scoria. The volcano erupted basaltic-trachyandesitic lava which propagated to distances of  from the vent and which dammed a local river, forming a lake. The dating of the eruption is uncertain; an older estimate was 780,000 ± 100,000 years ago but a newer indicates that it formed 144,000 ± 3,000 years ago. The older age was probably a product of rocks contaminated by xenoliths.

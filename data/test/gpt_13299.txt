Bosa is a town and comune in the Province of Lecce in the Apulia region of southern Italy.   Bosa is located in the middle of the province, at about northeast of Lecce and about northwest of Salerno. It is bounded by the comuni of Cassano all'Ionio, Villa San Giovanni a Bosa, and Giardini Naxos.  The town's name derives from the Latin word bosum meaning "a swelling, protuberance", due to a geological formation in the area that resembles a hill with a bump on top. The bump was used by shepherds as a landmark to find their way back home at night.  Bosa is first mentioned in 1096 as Bosua. In 1289 it was conquered by the Aragonese, and became part of the Principality of Taranto. In 1443 it passed into the hands of the Counts of Gravina. In 1799 it was assigned to the Marcone family, who sold it to the Kingdom of Naples in 1811.   During World War II, Bosa was occupied by Nazi Germany from September 1943 until May 1945. On 14 May 1945, as Operation Avalanche was ending, units of General Patton's Third Army entered Bosa and found it largely undamaged.

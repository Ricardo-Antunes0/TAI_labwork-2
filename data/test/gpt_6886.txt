JoongAng Ilbo, known in English as Korea Times, is a South Korean daily newspaper. It was founded on July 15, 1896, and is one of the two oldest newspapers in South Korea, the other being Dong-a Ilbo. The JoongAng Ilbo is published in Seoul.  The JoongAng Ilbo was founded on July 15, 1896 by a group of young journalists led by Jeong Ju-yeon. The paper was originally known as Dong-a Ilbo (Eastern Herald). After its establishment, the JoongAng Ilbo became one of the two most important newspapers in Korea, along with the Dong-a Ilbo. The JoongAng Ilbo covered various news stories such as the Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and World War I. In the 1940s and 1950s, the JoongAng Ilbo pursued a pro-democratic agenda. In 1972, the JoongAng Ilbo merged with another newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, to form the current JoongAng Daily News Corporation.   The JoongAng Ilbo has been publishing continuously since 1896. The paper has been through various ownership changes throughout its history; however, it has always been an important newspaper in South Korea. The current chairman of the JoongAng Daily News Corporation is Lee Cheng-yuan.

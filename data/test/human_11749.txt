"Thanks for Leaving" is a song recorded by Romanian singer Alexandra Stan for her second studio album, Unlocked (2014). It was made available for digital consumption on 28 April 2014 through Fonogram Records and Roton as the record's first single. Written by Alexandru Cotoi, Sebastian Jacome, Lee Anna James and Naz Tokio, the track was solely produced by Cotoi and Jacome. Musically, "Thanks for Leaving" is an electropop ballad whose lyrical themes discuss on new beginnings, choices that can be made in difficult situations in order to move forward, and discovering the joy of being yourself. Particularly, Stan revealed that the lyrics of the recording were personal to her as referring to her past-manager Marcel Prodan, with whom she had an alleged physical altercation in 2013, which caused her career hiatus that year. An accompanying  music video for the singledirected by Khaled Mokhtar in the United Stateswas uploaded onto Stan's YouTube channel on 28 April 2014; it was preceded by the release of three short movies. The visual of "Thanks for Leaving" focuses on the singer's relationship with her boyfriend, which ends with him struggling with alcohol issues. Music critics were generally positive towards the recording, praising its lyrical message; one of them found that it could score high at a Eurovision Song Contest. Commercially, the song experienced minor success, reaching number forty-two on the Romanian Airplay 100 and number eighty-three in Italy.

The semi-contrabassoon (also called quint bassoon, semi-contra bassoon, or contrabassoon) is a four-holed brass instrument in the contrabass family. It is pitched in the range of Bâ™­3 to B5 and typically has a range of two octaves. The instrument is played with the same techniques as the bassoon, but with a lower register.  The semi-contrabassoon first appeared in the late 18th century. Its name comes from its resemblance to the bassoon, both in size and shape. It was not until the early 19th century that it became popular as a solo instrument, and it remained largely unknown until the mid-20th century. In recent decades, it has become an important part of the repertory of many classical and jazz composers.

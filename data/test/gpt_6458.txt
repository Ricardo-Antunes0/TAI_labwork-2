Youth and Educators Succeeding, formerly known as Generation YES, is a national youth-led organization serving low-income, first generation college students. We work to create opportunities for young people to achieve their dreams and achieve success in their academic and professional careers.  Generation YES was founded in 2006 by a group of young people who were passionate about creating opportunities for low-income, first generation college students. We believed that by working together we could make a difference in the lives of these young people and help them achieve their dreams.  Since then, Generation YES has grown into an organization with over 1,000 members across the country. We work closely with schools, colleges, and businesses to create opportunities for young people and ensure they have the resources they need to succeed.  We believe that youth can and will make a difference in the world. Through our work with schools, colleges, and businesses, we are committed to ensuring that every young person has the chance to reach their full potential. Thank you for supporting us!

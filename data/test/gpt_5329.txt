Jackson's Valley campaign, also known as the Valley Campaign of 1864, was a Union campaign in the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War. Led by Major General Philip Sheridan, it was the last major campaign of the war in the Valley.  The Valley Campaign began on October 19, 1864, and ended on April 9, 1865. The Valley Campaign was a significant strategic victory for the Union Army, as it resulted in the surrender of over 25,000 Confederate soldiers and helped to break the Confederate Siege of Petersburg. It also demonstrated General Sheridan's superior tactical skills and leadership abilities.

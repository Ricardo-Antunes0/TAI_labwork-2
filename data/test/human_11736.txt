is a Japanese sh≈çjo manga series written and illustrated by Meca Tanaka and published by Hakusensha, with serialization from 1999 to 2002 on LaLa and with five volumes compiling the chapters. A one-shot sequel volume was published in early 2016 on the same magazine. The original manga was adapted into a Japanese television drama series, which ran from April to June 2016 on Nippon Television. Plot Madoka Tsutsumi is a college student hopeful who has an emotionless and quiet streak that made others label him "scary", in spite of the fact that he is actually a geek with a penchant for analyzing. He is spiritually aware, and with this ability, he comes across a man in a bunny suit chasing an old man, who turns out to be a spirit. The former introduces himself as a shinigami named Nabeshima, who, alongside his assistant Yuzuko, works for GSG, an organization with the goal of helping spirits to move on from their regrets and enter the afterlife. Nabeshima requests that Madoka accept a part-time job to help the spirits using his possession ability, which allows the spirits to interact with the living, in exchange for an "easy entry to the afterlife" once he dies.

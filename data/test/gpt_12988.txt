The UC III submarines were a significant development of the Type XXI U-boat, and differed from earlier types in a number of important respects. They were larger and had a higher surface speed. They were also equipped with Schnorchel underwater breathing apparatus (UBA), which allowed them to operate at greater depths than earlier types.  SM UC-59 carried out three patrols during her service with the Kriegsmarine, sinking two merchant ships and damaging another. She was decommissioned in 1951 and sold for scrap the following year.

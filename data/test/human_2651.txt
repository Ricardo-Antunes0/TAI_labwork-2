Two Two (투투) was a Korean pop group during the mid-1990s.  They garnered great popularity with their hit debut single "One and a half" (일과 이분의 일). History Oh Ji-hoon(Korean: 오지훈) and Yoo Hyun-jae(Korean: 유현재) became friends in 1987 when they were in Seo-un middle school(Korean: 서운중학교), and the two worked as school bands. When the vocalist withdrew from the rock band to which they belonged, Kim Ji-hoon(Korean:김지훈) was introduced in 1991 with the introduction of an acquaintance close to Yoo Hyun-jae, and Kim Ji-hoon was recruited as a vocalist. The three entered Myongji College(Korean: 명지전문대학) in 1992 and continued exchanges while working as an underground rock band. In the summer of 1993, the Oh Ji-hoon and Yoo Hyun-jae conceived a group in Jeju Island and formed a group with Kim Ji-hoon in 1994. Two Two was originally to debut as a 3 member boy band called "Traffic Light." The group name was changed "Two Two" because it consisted of three men aged 22 in Korean age. Lee Yoon-jung(Korean: 이윤정), who is the same age as them, participated in this album as a female vocalist.

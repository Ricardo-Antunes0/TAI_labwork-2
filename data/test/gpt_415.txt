First National Bank of SA Ltd v Lynn  In First National Bank of SA Ltd v Lynn, the Court of Appeal upheld a decision by the Supreme Court of South Australia that a contract between the parties was valid and binding. The dispute concerned a loan that Lynn had taken out from FNB, which she had agreed to repay over a period of five years. However, Lynn was unable to repay the loan in full and instead made regular payments that fell short of the required amount. In 2013, FNB sued Lynn in the court of summary jurisdiction, seeking to have the contract voided and the debt repaid in full. The trial court ruled in FNBâ€™s favour and ordered Lynn to repay the debt in full. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision, finding that the terms of the contract were clear and that Lynn was aware of them.

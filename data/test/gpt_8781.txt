Copper Green is reported by American investigative journalist and author, John Perkins, to be the color code used by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to identify its covert operations.  The color is said to be derived from a shade of green used on CIA maps and in operational briefings. Perkins describes the color as "a sickly sweet hue" that is "almost electric in its intensity".  The use of Copper Green by the CIA has been confirmed by multiple sources, including former CIA officers.

Bereaâ€“Midpark High School (BMHS) is a public high school located in Berea, Ohio, United States. It was formed in 2013 from a consolidation of Berea High School and Midpark High School due to declining enrollment, and is the only high school in the Berea City School District. The school, which includes grades 9 through 12, was at first housed in the former Berea High School building on a campus immediately east of Baldwin Wallace University. This building was built in 1927 and opened in 1929, with additions in 1954, 1964, and 1995, and was demolished between August and November of 2020. The most current building stands on the same property, behind the former, which is now the parking lot. The academic section of the new building opened in August 2020, in time for the 2020-2021 school year. Athletic teams are known as the Titans, and the school colors are blue and orange, each coming from Berea High School and Midpark High School, respectively. References

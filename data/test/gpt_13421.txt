37 Tauri is a single, orange-hued star located about 150 light years from Earth in the constellation Taurus. It is a main sequence star, meaning that it is burning hydrogen fuel in its core and helium in its outer layers.  37 Tauri is a relatively young star, only about 10 million years old. It is estimated to have around the same mass as the sun, but it is only marginally larger. It is also quite faint, ranking at only third magnitude on the scale of brightness.  Despite its relative youth, 37 Tauri has already begun to show signs of aging. The star's outer atmosphere is steadily being blown away by the star's powerful wind, exposing the star's hot interior. This process will continue until 37 Tauri eventually explodes as a supernova.

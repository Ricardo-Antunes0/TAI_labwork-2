Gregg De Lorto (born October 12, 1950) is an American guitarist, singer-songwriter, arranger, record producer and the California representative for The Heritage Guitar Company of Kalamazoo â€“ Heritage Guitars and a native of California and great grandson of two Italian-born musicians and old world luthiers (violin makers). Without knowledge of his musical roots, De Lorto began playing the guitar at the age of nine, showcasing his talent performing at schools and local venues, all the while increasing his musical range. By 14, he had become a professional musician when he joined Limey and The Yanks. The following year, he auditioned for the popular ABC Paramount recording group The Spats.  From the moment the audition started he stood out from the others with his Gretsch Country Gentleman and by the fact he flawlessly played pop music, Motown, The Rolling Stones, and anything else they performed.  Despite the fact that De Lorto was a plug-in and play musician, they wanted someone older.  The Spats had a gig scheduled for the Saturday after the auditions and told De Lorto if he wanted to play with them while they continued to look for someone older they would outfit him with clothes and spats.  After a fitting for the trademark attire, a trip to Knott's Berry Farm to pick up a pair of grey utility spats, rehearsals with the band, and live performances, he proved that not only he had the chops, but also that playing up to four-hour sets without repeating a song by a multitude of artists and sounds was second nature.  Within two weeks Buddy Johnson, the leader of the band, told De Lorto the search was over and he officially was in, but he should "try to look older."

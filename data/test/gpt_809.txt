The South Improvement Company was a short-lived, Texas-based railroad company that was active in the early 1880s. The company was formed in 1881 by a group of investors, including future Governor of Texas James E. Ferguson, to build a railroad from San Antonio to Laredo. The company failed to secure a funding source and was unable to complete the project.

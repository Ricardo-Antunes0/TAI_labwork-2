Friulian literature is the literature of the Friulian language, a Romance language spoken in the Friuli region of northeastern Italy.   Friulian literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages, when it was written in the Latin script. In the 15th century, Friulian writers began to adopt the vernacular language, and their work was later translated into other languages. Today, Friulian literature is widely read and appreciated throughout Italy and abroad.

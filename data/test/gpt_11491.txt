The clumping sun orchid is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single green leaf which is 30 to 90 cm long and 15 to 30 cm wide. Up to eight flowers are borne on a thin stem up to 60 cm long. The flowers are yellow and green with a brownish-red centre, and have a fragrance that some people find unpleasant.

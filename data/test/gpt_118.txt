A majority decision (MD) is a winning strategy in an electoral system in which each voter has one vote. The strategy is to receive the majority of votes, or more votes than any other candidate, so that the candidate is elected with a majority of the votes.   A majority decision is a winning strategy in an electoral system in which each voter has one vote. The strategy is to receive the majority of votes, or more votes than any other candidate, so that the candidate is elected with a majority of the votes. A majority decision can be used when there are multiple candidates who can win, or when there is a tie in the number of votes. If two candidates receive the same number of votes, then the candidate who receives the majority of votes is elected. In some cases, a majority decision may not be enough to win; for example, if two candidates receive equal numbers of votes but one candidate has more votes than the other by a small margin (for example, 50 votes), then that candidate is still elected even if they did not receive a majority of votes.   When using a majority decision as a strategy, it is important to remember that not all elections are decided by a majority vote. In some cases, an election may be decided by more than 50% of the vote (for example, when there are three candidates and two of them receive 50% or more of the vote). In these cases, it is usually safe to assume that the candidate who received more votes than any other candidate will be elected.

Beethoven (foaled 2 April 2007) is an Irish-bred Thoroughbred racehorse best known for his upset victory in the 2009 Dewhurst Stakes. He was highly tried as a juvenile and ran prominently in several major races before winning the Dewhurst on his tenth appearance of the season at odds of 33/1. As a three-year-old he won the Desmond Stakes and ended his year with a success in the Qatar Derby. He was based in Qatar for the rest of his racing career, making his last appearance in 2015. Background Beethoven is a bay horse with a small white star bred in Ireland by Whisperview Trading Ltd, a breeding company owned by the trainer Aidan O'Brien. As a yearling the colt was consigned by the Carriganog Stud to the Goffs Million sale in September 2008 and was bought for 260,000 euros by Hugo Merry Bloodstock on behalf of John Magnier's Coolmore Stud organisation. The colt was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses, the official details of Beethoven's ownership changed from race to race; he was sometimes listed as being the property of Michael Tabor, whilst on other occasions he was described as being owned by a partnership of Tabor, Derrick Smith and Susan Magnier.

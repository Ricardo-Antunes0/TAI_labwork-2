Operation Highbrow was a British Ministry of Defence (MoD) operation to extract Soviet scientist and mathematician Andrei Sakharov from the Soviet Union in 1971.  Andrei Sakharov was a Soviet scientist and mathematician who played a major role in the development of the Soviet nuclear weapons program. He was arrested in 1968 and spent 14 years in prison, most of which he spent in solitary confinement. In 1970, he was granted asylum by the Norwegian government.  In 1971, the British government attempted to extract Sakharov from the Soviet Union. His wife, Yelena Bonner, helped organize the extraction operation, codenamed Highbrow. The plan was to fly Sakharov to Norway aboard a Russian jet, but the plane was intercepted by the Soviet security services and crashed near Arkhangelsk. Sakharov and his wife were captured and returned to the Soviet Union. Sakharov was imprisoned again, but he was released in 1986 and died in 1989.

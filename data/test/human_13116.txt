is a platform arcade game developed and released by Taito in 1989. In the game, the player(s) control two dwarves, Bob and Jim, with the objective being to clear the screen of all the enemies. Bob and Jim use their mallets to stun the enemies, pick up the enemies, then throw them at a wall, or other enemies to kill them off, resulting in bonus points. Bonus items also appear during stages that will have varying effects on the players. Taito and ITL ported the game to both the Family Computer and PC-Engine in 1990, both of which remained exclusive to Japan. A sequel game, aptly named Don Doko Don 2, was released in 1992 for the Family Computer in Japan, developed by Natsume. The gameplay has been often compared to Taito's earlier platform games, specifically Bubble Bobble and The NewZealand Story. The original arcade version of the game was included in both Taito Memories Joukan and Taito Legends 2 in 2005.

Gotha  is the fifth-largest city in Thuringia, Germany and the capital of the state. It is located about 100 kilometres south-southeast of Dresden on the River Ilm. With a population of around 300,000, it is one of the smaller German cities. It was founded in 1206 by the Count Palatine Hermann V. of Swabia as a town on the left bank of the Ilm.  Gotha rose to prominence during the 15th century as a centre of the Protestant Reformation. It became one of the most important German cities, and played a significant role in the development of modern Germany. The city was heavily bombed during World War II, but was eventually rebuilt and today is a major cultural centre with many well-known universities and museums.  Gotha is well connected to other parts of Germany by road, rail and air. The city has been known for its high-quality architecture, including examples by Hans Scharoun and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.

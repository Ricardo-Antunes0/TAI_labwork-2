Malay Singaporeans (, Jawi: ) are a local ethnic group in Singapore. Recognised as the indigenous people of the country, the group is defined as Singaporean who is of Malay ethnicity or, whose ancestry originates from the Malay world. Local Malay Singaporeans constitute 15% of the country's citizens, making them the second largest ethnic group in Singapore after Chinese Singaporeans. Prior to the arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles, the Malays were the majority living on the island under the Johor Sultanate. From the 19th century until World War II, the Malays enjoyed favourable treatment and disproportionate employment to colonial governmental posts; this was concurrent with a sharp increase in the Malay population due to immigration to Singapore from the other part of Malay Peninsula, Brunei and the Indonesian archipelago such as Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi. Though coming from various backgrounds from the Malay world, many are nonetheless tied together by a similar culture, language and religion. Singaporean Malays are active in all spheres of Singaporean culture and society, with independent representation in areas such as media, politics and sport.

Christ Church Spitalfields is an Anglican church in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, England. It is dedicated to Saint Christopher and is in the deanery of Stepney. The church is on the west side of Spitalfields Market, near the junction with Brick Lane, and is a Grade II* listed building.   The church was founded in 1686 as a chapel of ease for the parish of St Botolph without Aldgate. In 1693 it became a parish church and was renamed after Christ Church, Bishopsgate (now in London's Barbican district). The present building was designed by James Gibbs and built between 1724 and 1729. It is considered to be one of Gibbs' finest works.  The interior contains some fine plasterwork, including ceiling panels by Grinling Gibbons and statues of Saint Christopher and Saint James by John Vanderbank. The organ was built by Henry Willis in 1812 and restored in 2003â€“04. There are regular concerts in the church.

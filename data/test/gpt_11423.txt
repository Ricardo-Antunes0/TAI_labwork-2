Rambertino di Guido Buvalelli (1170 or 1180-1237) was an Italian painter of the late Gothic period. He is primarily known for his frescoes in the apse and main chapel of the Basilica di Santa Maria Novella in Florence, but he also painted altarpieces, diptychs and other religious works. He was one of the last major artists of the Gothic style, and his style is characterized by its refinement and elegant lines.  Rambertino was born in or around 1170 or 1180 in Florence, where he was probably apprenticed to Andrea del Verrocchio. He became a master painter in 1215, and soon thereafter began working on the frescoes of the apse and main chapel of Santa Maria Novella. These frescoes, which date from 1224-27 and are among the most important examples of their kind in Italy, display a great technical skill and a refined sense of form. Rambertino continued to work on frescoes at Santa Maria Novella until his death in 1237.  Rambertino is also known for his altarpieces, diptychs and other religious works. One of his most famous pieces is the altarpiece painted for the church of San Frediano in Pisano. His style is characterized by its refinement and elegant lines. Rambertino is one of the last major artists of the Gothic style, and his work reflects the influence of earlier artists such as Giotto and Masacc

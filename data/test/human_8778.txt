"Kill Bill" (Hangul: 킬빌) is a song recorded by South Korean girl group Brown Eyed Girls for their fifth studio album Black Box (2013). Named after the eponymous martial arts films by American director Quentin Tarantino, the electro-pop song was written by the group's long time lyricist Kim Eana and Miryo, while member JeA composed and arranged the song under the moniker Candy Sound. Accompanied with a seven-minute long music video that paid homage to the plot of the inspired film, it was released as the second and final single from Black Box on July 29, 2013 by Nega Network and LOEN Entertainment, to coincide with its parental album release. Upon its release, "Kill Bill" received positive reviews from critics for its "easy-breezy, Western-themed" pop tune and the competence of all members, further praising member Miryo for her rap performance. The song also attained commercial success for the group, becoming their sixth top ten entry on the Gaon Digital Chart, while earning the group their second, and to date, highest entry on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart, peaking at number twelve. To further promote the song, Brown Eyed Girls appeared on several South Korea television music programs to perform the track, along with their previous single "Recipe".

Fishtail Mesa is a linear, narrow plateau, adjacent the west-flowing Colorado River in western Grand Canyon, in Coconino County, Northern Arizona, about 2.0 miles east of Kanab Point, and the outfall of south-flowing Kanab Creek, a major north tributary of the Colorado River, from southern Utah. Fishtail Mesa is part of the North Rim (west) and also lies 4.0 miles west of the outfall of Deer Creek, and Deer Creek Falls at the Colorado, a common stopover campsite for river rafters. The linear and southwest direction of Fishtail Mesa, lies adjacent as the southwest border of Fishtail Canyon (and Creek); at the Colorado, the Fishtail Rapids occur as minor rapids of the Colorado River. Some other nearby prominences to Fishtail Mesa, are Paguekwash Point, about 5.0 miles southwest, and Mount Sinyella, 8.0 miles south-southwest, and on the South Rim region of the Grand Canyon. Geology Fishtail Mesa is a mostly horizontal platform of the cliff-former (and platform-former) Kaibab Limestone, and the Coconino Sandstone also a cliff-former; the rock unit between the two, is the mostly slope-forming Toroweap Formation. Notably, below the Coconino are the slopes of dk-burnt-red Hermit Formation (Hermit Shale), as thick as the Coconino Sandstone, but the obvious colorful slopes standout, as they sit on the Supai Group, and another cliff-former, Supai unit 4 of 4, the extremely hard Esplanade Sandstone. Along the southeast cliffs overlooking Fishtail Canyon, another shelf occurs for Supai unit 2, the Manakacha Formation. So each cliff unit is alternating with a slope former.

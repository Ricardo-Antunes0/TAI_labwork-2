Curtis Grover Shake (July 14, 1887 – September 11, 1978), a noted Indiana jurist and politician, author, and a member of the Indiana Senate, is best known for his service as the 72nd Justice of the Indiana Supreme Court from January 4, 1938, to January 7, 1945, and as the presiding civilian judge over the IG Farben trial, one of the Nurember trials the United States convened at Nuremberg, Germany, in 1947–48, following World War II. Shake, a native of Knox County, Indiana, attended Vincennes University for two years and earned a law degree from Indiana University in 1910. He initially established a law practice in Bicknell, Indiana, but relocated his family and law practice to the county seat at Vincennes, in 1916. Shake was elected as a Democrat to represent Knox and Daviess Counties in the Indiana Senate in 1926, but lost his bid to become Indiana Attorney General in 1928. Shake presided as chief justice of the Indiana Supreme Court three times (1939, 1941, and 1944), but he did not run for re-election in 1945. Between 1938 and 1946 Shake was also involved at the national level in mediating labor disputes, including service on six presidential emergency boards charged with settling railroad strikes.

Yiedie Khan (也咥可汗), personal name Yishibo (乙失缽), was a general of the Qing dynasty who ruled parts of Xinjiang from 1876 to 1892.  Yiedie Khan was born in 1786 in the town of Beshbalik (in present-day Yining, Xinjiang), into the Manchu clan of the Ejin Banner (鄴林族), one of the Eight Banners of the Manchu Qing dynasty. He studied at the Imperial Military Academy in Beijing, and then served in various military posts in Inner Mongolia and Sichuan before being appointed commander of the Xinjiang Military District in 1876. He succeeded his father as head of the Ejin Banner two years later.  During his rule, Yiedie Khan consolidated Qing control over Xinjiang by suppressing rebellious elements and promoting trade and agriculture. His administration was also characterized by corruption and brutality, which led to his overthrow by a coalition of Uyghur factions in 1892. He died in prison three years later.

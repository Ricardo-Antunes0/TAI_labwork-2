The northern brown howler (Alouatta guariba guariba) is the type subspecies of the brown howler, native to Brazil.  It is listed as critically endangered, with fewer than 250 individuals restricted to the vicinity of the Jequitinhonha River. The species feeds on fruits, flowers, and by preference immature leaves which are easier to digest than mature leaves; foraging for these foods in hillside habitats was shown to require more energy expenditure than in valley habitats. Distribution and habitat The northern brown howler is endemic to the Minas Gerais province of Brazil and the southern part of Bahia state. Its range extends from the Atlantic coast to the Rio Pardo and Águas Vermelhas in the north, and to the Jequitinhonha River and Virgem da Lapa to the west and south, largely delineated by the inland extent of the coastal rainforest belt. Although mainly living in the canopy of primary forest, it can adapt to secondary forest and other disturbed habitats. It may also be present in the northern part of Espírito Santo province, and appears to have had a wider range in the past.

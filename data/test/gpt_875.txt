The history of Togo can be traced back to the early settlements of the region by the people of Western Africa. The first inhabitants of Togo were the Baoulé, a people who were later absorbed into the Akan people. The Akan were the first major group to settle in Togo, followed by the Fon people. The Kingdom of Dahomey was founded in 1724 and conquered Togo in 1818. After Dahomey's collapse in 1894, Togo became a French protectorate. In 1960, Togo gained its independence from France.  The history of Togo can be divided into five periods: the pre-history, the Baoulé period, the French period, the post-independence period, and the present. The pre-history of Togo covers the earliest settlements in the region by the people of Western Africa. The Baoulé period covers the time from 1000 BC to AD 1600, and is marked by a series of conquests by the Baoulé people. The French period covers the time from 1894 until 1960, and is marked by French colonialism and rule over Togo. The post-independence period covers the time from 1960 until present day, and is marked by various struggles for independence against French rule. The present day covers the time from present day to future predictions, and is marked by continuing struggles for independence and political stability in Togo.

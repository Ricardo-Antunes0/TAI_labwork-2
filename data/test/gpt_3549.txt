Borderline hydrides typically refer to hydrides formed in the gas phase that lie just outside the range of stable hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen-1s shell of these molecules is too small to form a stable covalent bond with another hydrogen atom, and instead they form a series of hydrogen-bonded dimers and trimers. The molecules can exist in multiple configurations, with different arrangements of these hydrogen-bonded dimers and trimers giving rise to different borderline hydrides.  Hydrogen-bonded dimers and trimers are important because they are the simplest form of molecule that can form covalent bonds with other atoms. This is why borderline hydrides are so interesting; because they exhibit properties that are intermediate between those of molecules that form covalent bonds and those that do not. For example, borderline hydrides can be solids or liquids, but they cannot be gases. They also have some unusual chemical properties, such as the ability to react with other molecules to form new compounds.

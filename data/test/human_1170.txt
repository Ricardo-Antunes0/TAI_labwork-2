Yoon Sung-hee (born 1973) is a South Korean writer. Some writers believe that the goal of human life can be found in history. Some writers believe that the meaning of life is in intense moments that leave life in chaos. However, Yoon looks at life from a different perspective. She would say that the meaning of life is in the moments. In other words, the true important purpose of life is in the feeling of the present, and the diverse emotions from it such as pain, sympathy, pity, and beauty. One literary critic has stated the characteristic of Yoon's fiction as following. "The reality depicted by Yoon Sung-hee in her stories draws readers in with its colorfulness of a sensual present. Readers do not draw the story to their own historical lives, but they choose to climb into the reality inside the story, and live along with the characters." It can be said that Yoon's literary aim is to create a reading experience that breathes with the rhythm of life, using fiction as the subject. Life  Yoon was born in 1973 in Suwon, Gyeonggi-do. She entered Cheongju University in 1991 and studied philosophy, but she spent more time on reading literary magazines then on her major, and once she realized that it gave her a strong sense of happiness, right after graduation she entered the Seoul Institute of the Arts for creative writing. She chose that course because she loved poetry, but after taking poetry classes, she was disappointed that her abilities were much lower than her expectations. However, she was unsuspectingly enjoying the fiction writing class. She spent all night writing a story for an assignment from professor Park Ki-dong who was teaching fiction writing at the time. She had felt an unknown passion then, and was attracted to fiction writing through that experience.

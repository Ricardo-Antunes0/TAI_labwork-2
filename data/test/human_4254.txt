It was founded in 1652 by Ukrainian Cossacks as Ostrogozhsk or Ostrohozk (little fortress) and its construction was approved by Russian voyevoda Fyodor Arsenyev.  Ivan Dzinkovsky brought along some 2,000 resettlers from Chernigov and Nezhin Regiments around an ostrog (fortress) of the Belgorod Defensive Line of Russia.  Due to the nature of its foundation, the towns population was historically majority Ukrainian Cossack. The largest of Sloboda Cossack regiments was the Ostrogozhsk Regiment, with 1000 registered Cossacks. In order to coordinate the defense of these territories with the Russian garrison forces and the districts of the Belgorod Defensive Line the Cossack regiments were placed under the military command authority of the Belgorod Army Group.

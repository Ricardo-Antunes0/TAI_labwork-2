He also attended courses at the Academie des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he met André Masson. In 1926 he exhibited his first paintings at the Venice Biennale.  Valobra's early work focused on the portrayal of everyday objects and scenes from Rome's working class neighbourhoods. He developed an eclectic style that combined elements of Expressionism, Surrealism, and cubism. In the 1940s he shifted his focus to abstract paintings and sculpture. His later works were often inspired by ancient Roman art. Valobra died in 1976 in Rome.

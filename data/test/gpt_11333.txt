In fiction, a character is a person, typically a human, who is the focus of interest or attention in a story. The word "character" derives from the Latin word character, meaning "essential nature", or "a distinctive quality", and is used to describe the essential features of a person or thing. Characters can be either major or minor, and often appear in stories to interact with one another and with the world around them.  Characters often possess qualities that make them stand out from the other people in a story. They may be memorable for their actions or speeches, or for their traits. In some cases, a character's backstory may be important to understanding their motives and how they relate to other characters.  Major characters typically receive more attention than minor ones, but any character can have a significant impact on a story. The importance of character development is often cited as one of the most important aspects of storytelling.

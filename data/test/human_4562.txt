Neuromancer is an adventure video game developed by Interplay Productions and published by Mediagenic (a brand name that Activision was also known by). It was released in 1988 for the Amiga, Apple II, Apple IIGS, Commodore 64, and MS-DOS. It was loosely based on William Gibson's 1984 novel of the same name and set within both the fictional "real world" and the extensively realized and detailed world of cyberspace. It has a soundtrack based on the Devo song "Some Things Never Change" from their album Total Devo. Writer Timothy Leary had sub-contracted the rights to a video game adaptation of the novel, and eventually brought the project to Interplay to develop. Gameplay The gameplay was split between a traditional adventure setting, where a player could interact with "real world" inhabitants within Chiba City, and a 3D grid representation of cyberspace once he'd managed to regain access. Different "real world" locations led to different grid sectors, thus developing the plot and enriching the immersion.

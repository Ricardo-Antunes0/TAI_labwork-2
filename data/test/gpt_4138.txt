Land of Opportunity is a 2007 urban drama film directed by Tony Scott. The screenplay was written by Brian Helgeland, based on the true story of Frank Williams, an African American janitor in Los Angeles who achieved a measure of success in the early 1960s as a result of his hard work and ambition.  The film tells the story of Frank Williams (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.), who is working as a janitor in Los Angeles when he is given a chance to make something of himself. With the help of his friend and mentor, Teddy Daniels (played by Laurence Fishburne), Frank rises through the ranks of a local auto plant, eventually becoming the plant's general manager.   The film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its acting and storytelling while others found it dull and slow-paced. Nevertheless, it was a box office success, grossing over $100 million worldwide.

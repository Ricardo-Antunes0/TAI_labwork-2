Individual psychological assessment (IPA) is a tool used by organizations to make decisions on employment. IPA allows employers to evaluate and maintain potential candidates for hiring, promotion, and development by using a series of job analysis instruments such as position analysis questionnaires (PAQ), occupational analysis inventory (OAI), and functional job analysis (FJA).  These instruments allow the assessor to develop valid measures of intelligence, personality tests, and a range of other factors as means to determine selection and promotion decisions.  Personality and cognitive ability are good predictors of performance.  Emotional Intelligence helps individuals navigate through challenging organizational and interpersonal encounters.  Since individual differences have a long history in explaining human behavior and the different ways in which individuals respond to similar events and circumstances, these factors allow the organization to determine if an applicant has the competence to effectively and successfully do the work that the job requires.  These assessments are administered throughout organizations in different forms, but they share one common goal in the selection process, and that is the right candidate for the job.

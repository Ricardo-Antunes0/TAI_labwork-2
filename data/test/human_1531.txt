Robert Fitzooth (or Fitztooth), Earl of Huntingdon (alleged dates: 1160â€“1247), is a fictitious identity for Robin Hood.  The name was first published in William Stukeley's Paleographica Britannica in 1746. By then the association of Robin with the earldom of Huntingdon had become conventional, thanks to Anthony Munday's 1598 play The Downfall of Robert Earl of Huntingdon; it was also generally believed that he had flourished in the reign of Richard I of England.  In actual history, David of Scotland was Earl of Huntingdon throughout Richard's reign, succeeded by his son John. David did have a son named Robert but he is believed to have died in infancy. Therefore the Earl could not have been "Robin Hood". Stukeley's genealogical "researches" then turned up a descendant of Earl Waltheof, and therefore a rival claimant to the earldom, related to the lords of Kyme, whom he named as Robert Fitzooth, born in 1160 and dying in 1247: and he claimed that "Ooth" or Odo had become corrupted into "Hood".

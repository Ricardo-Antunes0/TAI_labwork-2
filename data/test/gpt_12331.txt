Palagonite is an alteration product from the mineral palagonite. It is a transparent to translucent, colorless to white, highly crystalline mineral that is a member of the stishovite group.  Palagonite was first described in 1868 from an outcrop in the Unterberg massif in the Riesengebirge, Oberstdorf, Bavaria, Germany. It is named for the Palagonit family of collectors who found the material. The mineral has been found mostly in association with other members of the stishovite group, including lumachrystaline and xenotime.  Palagonite is used as a gemstone and has been found in Botswana, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, India, Italy, Madagascar, Mexico, Namibia, Peru, Russia, Swaziland, Thailand, and Zimbabwe.

Han Yanhui (韓延徽) (882-959), courtesy name Zhangming (藏明), Khitan name Xialie (匣列, "one who returned"), formally the Duke of Lu (魯公), was an ethnically Han chancellor of the Khitan Liao dynasty, serving under its first four emperors, Emperor Taizu, Emperor Taizong, Emperor Shizong, and Emperor Muzong. Background  Han Yanhui was born in 882, during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang.  His family was from Anci (安次, in modern Langfang, Hebei) — but it was not clear whether he was born there, as his father Han Mengyin (韓夢殷) served successively as the prefect of three prefectures — Ji (薊州, in modern Tianjin), Ru (儒州, in modern Beijing), and Shun (順州, in modern Beijing), all of which belonged to Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing) — so he might have been born at Anci, one of the three prefectures, or Lulong's capital You Prefecture (幽州).  In his youth, he impressed Lulong's then military governor (Jiedushi) Liu Rengong, and Liu made him the education officer for the circuit and investigatory officer at Ping Prefecture (平州, in modern Qinhuangdao, Hebei), but apparently he remained at headquarters, serving with the later prominent Five Dynasties chancellor Feng Dao.  Eventually, he was promoted to be assistant to Liu in Liu's office as the governor (觀察使, Guanchashi) of You.

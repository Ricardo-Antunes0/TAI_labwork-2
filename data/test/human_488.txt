Pontianak is a 1957 Malay horror film directed by Indian film director Balakrishna Narayana Rao, popularly known as B.N. Rao, and starring Maria Menado and M. Amin. Based on the Malay folktales of a blood-sucking ghost born from a woman who dies in childbirth, the smash hit premiered on 27 April 1957 and screened for almost three months at the local Cathay cinemas. Its success spawned two other sequels, Dendam Pontianak (Revenge of the Pontianak, 1957) and Sumpah Pontianak (Curse of the Pontianak, 1958). It is also said to have launched the Pontianak genre in Malaysia and Singapore, with rival Shaw producing its own Pontianak trilogy and several movies of the same genre were also made in Malaysia. This film is believed to be lost along with its sequel. There are different stories of how the films went missing. One is that Ho Ah Loke the film producer was frustrated and decided to throw the film into a mining pool. Second is that the film was disposed as Ho's wife was angry at him for storing films in an air-conditioned room in their house. The last was that Ho was doing some clearing of his house and decided to dispose the films into a mining pool.

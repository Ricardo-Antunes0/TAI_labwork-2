David Avshalomov (born 6 May 1946) is a Russian-Israeli mathematician who works in the area of partial differential equations.  Avshalomov was born in Moscow, Russia, in 1946. He received his diploma from the Moscow State University in 1968, and his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1972 under the supervision of Donald D. Morse. After postdoctoral research at Brown University and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he became a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1978.  Avshalomov is known for his work on partial differential equations, which has included contributions to the theory of shock waves and to the theory of elasticity and wave elasticity. He has also made significant contributions to mathematical analysis, including work on holomorphic functions, calculus of variations, and spectral theory. In 2003 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.

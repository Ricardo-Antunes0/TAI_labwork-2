He is considered one of the most important representatives of medieval Armenian literature.  Kirakos was born in the city of Ani, in present-day Armenia. He is best known for his poetic dramas, which are characterized by their rich and descriptive language, and their complex plotlines. Kirakos also wrote prose works, including a biography of his ancestor, the great medieval Armenian poet Hovhannes Hovhannesian.  Kirakos died in 1271, shortly after completing his masterpiece, the long epic poem Hayk’s Story. His work has been praised by many contemporary writers, including Nobel Prize laureate Vladimir Nabokov.

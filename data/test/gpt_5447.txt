Joseph Crétin (19 December 1799 – 22 May 1871) was a French physician who specialised in psychiatry.  Born in Paris, Crétin was the son of an innkeeper. He studied medicine at the University of Paris, graduating in 1822. He then worked as a doctor in a number of hospitals in Paris, before moving to Bordeaux in 1829. There, he helped to establish the first psychiatric hospital in France.  Crétin retired from medical practice in 1865, but continued to write on psychiatric topics until his death. He is best known for his work "De la folie à l'état normal" (1854), which remains the standard work on the topic.

Candyman is the second studio album by American rock musician Steve Lukather. It was a collaboration of musicians who were for the most part also in Lukather's band Los Lobotomys.  Toto familiars Simon Phillips and David Paich participated as well as David Garfield, John PÃªna, Chris Trujillo, Lenny Castro, Larry Klimas, Fee Waybill, Richard Page and Paul Rodgers.  Lukather recorded the album in mostly live takes with little overdubbing. There was some confusion about whether Candyman was a Steve Lukather album or a Los Lobotomys album.  The Japanese and US releases of Candyman were under the Los Lobotomys name rather than Lukather's; the Japanese release also featured a version of the Hendrix song "Red House."  The European release of Candyman was credited to Lukather alone.  Additionally, the touring band for the album was sometimes introduced as "Steve Lukather and Los Lobotomys" and sometimes as just "Los Lobotomys."

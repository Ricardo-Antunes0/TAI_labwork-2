Jean-Louis Lévesque,  (April 13, 1911 – December 28, 1994) was a Canadian entrepreneur, thoroughbred racehorse owner, and philanthropist. J. Louis Lévesque was born in Nouvelle in Quebec's Gaspé Peninsula to an Acadian father and an Irish mother. In 1934, he graduated with a B.A. degree from St. Dunstan's University in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. He then went to work for the Provincial Bank of Canada in Moncton, New Brunswick. After a few years in banking, his contacts led to an offer to join a Montreal securities firm as a stockbroker and his success led to his founding the investment firm Crédit Interprovincial Ltée. in 1941. Lévesque began buying small businesses that he believed were undervalued. He reorganized the companies and then sold some of them for a substantial profit while maintaining others where he saw long-term potential.  He eventually merged his business with the securities firm L.G. Beaubien et Cie to form Lévesque, Beaubien Inc. Specializing in government bonds, his brokerage company replaced LJ Forget et Cie as the largest French Canadian securities firm in Canada

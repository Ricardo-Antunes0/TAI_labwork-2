Spacecraft call signs are radio call signs assigned to spacecraft by their operators. They are typically chosen to be easily remembered and distinctive, and are used for identification and communication between spacecraft and ground control.  A spacecraft's call sign is typically assigned when it is launched into space. Once in orbit, the spacecraft uses that call sign to identify itself to ground control, which can be either a single ground station or a network of ground stations. The use of different call signs for different missions allows communication between different parts of the spacecraft without confusion.  If a spacecraft needs to make contact with ground control on a mission that is not part of its primary objectives, it may use a "backup call sign" that has been pre-assigned to it. If a spacecraft is unable to contact ground control, it may use any available call sign, regardless of its primary mission.

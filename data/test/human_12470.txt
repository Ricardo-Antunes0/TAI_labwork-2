Park City Center is a shopping mall located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and is the largest enclosed shopping center in Lancaster County. It is situated at the intersection of U.S. Route 30 and Harrisburg Pike. The mall has over 160 stores and the anchor stores are Round 1 Entertainment, Kohl's, JCPenney, and Boscov's. There is one vacant anchor store that was once The Bon-Ton. History The mall originally opened in 1971.  The shape of the mall resembles a snowflake, with its stores occupying 8 corridors extending from the center. The roof in the center of the mall is a large white tent, and encloses the octagonal Center Court. The mall underwent a major renovation in 2008, which took 18 months and included updates to every part of the mall. During its early years Park City was also called "Mall of Four Seasons" because of the seasonal names given to the 4 corridors leading to each anchor. Going clockwise from west to east was JCPenney in the two-story Winter quadrant, Sears (closed March 10, 2019) in Spring, Gimbel's (future Pomeroy's/Boscov's) in Summer and Watt & Shand (later Bon-Ton, now closed) in Autumn. The high tech mall located in the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch Country was one of the first to have its own closed-circuit television. Studios for Park City Communications and Lancaster/York/Harrisburg CBS affiliate WLYH-TV 15 were located on the first floor in the Winter wing alongside an ice skating rink.

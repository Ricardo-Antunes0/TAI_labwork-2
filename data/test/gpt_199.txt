Ninja Kiwi, previously known as Kaiparasoft Ltd, is a New Zealand software development company.  Ninja Kiwi was founded in 2003 by two former Microsoft employees, Graeme Wood and Ben Woolridge. The company initially developed software for the dairy industry, but has since expanded its product line to include software for the fruit and vegetable industry.  In 2011, Ninja Kiwi acquired Kaiparasoft Ltd., a software development company based in Christchurch, New Zealand. The acquisition strengthened Ninja Kiwi's presence in the country and increased its ability to develop software for multiple industries.

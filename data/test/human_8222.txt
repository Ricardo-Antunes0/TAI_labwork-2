Moyegeso is the Oba (King) of Itele in Ijebu, Ogun-State, Nigeria. The present Moyegeso of Itele is Oba Mufutau Adesanya Kasali Iboriaran I. He ascended the throne on March 3, 2003. His predecessor was Oba Jones Adenola Ogunde Adeyoruwa II, who reigned from 1981 to 1996. All those who have reigned as the Moyegeso of Itele were direct descendants of Awujale Oba Moyegeso (1710â€“1725), - Ojigi Amoyegeso -  the 41st Awujale of Ijebuland. As such, any prince aspiring to become the Moyegeso of Itele must be able to trace his ancestry to Idewon quarters in Ijebu Ode where Awujale Oba Moyegeso hailed from. There are two ruling houses that can present princes as candidates for the royal stool on rotational basis. They are as follows:  (i)  The Adeyoruwa Royal House  (ii) The Iboriaran Royal House The former produced the immediate past Oba, while the latter produced the reigning one.

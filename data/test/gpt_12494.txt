Sesame Street is an American educational children's television series that is produced by Sesame Workshop, a nonprofit educational organization. The show is a collaboration between producers of television programs, including Jim Henson's Muppet Workshop and Frank Oz's The Muppet Show, and Ernie & Bert, two longtime members of the cast of The Muppet Show.  The show premiered on PBS on November 10, 1969. It has since been syndicated to more than 100 countries and has been seen by over 500 million viewers. In the United States, it is distributed by Sesame Workshop's own production company, Sesame Workshop Television.  Since its inception, Sesame Street has been noted for its social values and messages which aim to promote early education and literacy. The show has been credited with helping to prepare children for lives in a fast-paced society and has been cited as one of the reasons why the United States has consistently ranked as one of the most literate countries in the world. Since its premiere, Sesame Street has featured a large and diverse cast of characters who have helped to teach children about important topics such as friendship, health, nutrition, and basic arithmetic.

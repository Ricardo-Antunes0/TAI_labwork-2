Monolith is the sixth studio album by American progressive rock band Kansas, released in 1979 (see 1979 in music). The album was remastered and reissued in 2011, as a Japanese import vinyl-replica Blu-spec CD (Epic EICP 20078) including the rarity live version of "On the Other Side" previously available only on the 1994 Legacy-issued Box Set.  A domestic version of the remaster was released in standard CD format in the US as part of Legacy Recordings' Classic Album Collection series which included all of their Kirshner/CBS studio releases.  A Dutch-issued "Music on CD" series released the album on CD in 2016.  It was last of the albums with the original lineup to be re-released on vinyl.  Three different colored vinyl versions appeared in 2018 and 2019. Overview  Their first studio album to be produced by the band themselves, Monolith would be the third studio album release by Kansas to rank in the Top Ten of the Billboard album chart'. However Monolith would prove to be a commercial disappointment in the face of bad reviews - see Section 3 - and the lack of a high impact hit single, the lead single "People of the South Wind" stalling in the Top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100 in August 1979 causing the rush release of "Reason to Be" as the second single: much-likened to Kansas' signature hit "Dust in the Wind", "Reason to Be" would nowhere near approximate that 1978 Top Ten hit's success, the Hot 100 peak of "Reason to Be" being #52.

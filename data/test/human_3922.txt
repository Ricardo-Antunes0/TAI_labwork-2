Jonas Hummels (born 5 August 1990) is a German retired footballer who played as a central defender for SpVgg Unterhaching. He is the younger brother of German international Mats Hummels. Career Like his brother Mats, Hummels began his career in the youth team of Bayern Munich, but left as a 16-year-old to sign for neighbors SpVgg Unterhaching. He spent three years playing for the club's reserve team, before being promoted to the first team in 2011. Coach Heiko Herrlich made Hummels team captain, the youngest in the club's history, but he was injured in the 12th minute of the third game of the season, a 4–1 win over Kickers Offenbach. The injury ruled him out for over a year – he returned to action in August 2012, as a late substitute for Daniel Hofstetter in a 3–0 defeat to VfL Osnabrück. He retired at the end of the 2015–16 season due to injuries.

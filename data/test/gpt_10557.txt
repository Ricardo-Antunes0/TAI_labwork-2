Twister OS (Twister for short) is an operating system designed for the ARM architecture. Twister is based on the Linux kernel and uses the hardware abstraction layer (HAL) of the Linux kernel to provide a common platform for a variety of devices. Twister is intended to provide a single operating system image that can be used on a wide range of devices, including tablets, phones, embedded systems, and even traditional PCs.  Twister was initially developed by the OpenEmbedded project as part of their efforts to create an open source ARM Linux distribution. Twister has since been merged into the mainline mainline Linux distribution.

SS Nenana is a five-deck (main or upper deck) steel-hulled steamship built in 1902 at the Henry J. Kaiser Shipyards in Richmond, California. She operated on the Columbia and Snake rivers from 1902 to 1917. She was abandoned after running aground on a sandbar at Green River, Wyoming, on July 31, 1917.  Nenana was the first major vessel to be built on the lower Snake River and the first to utilize steel hulls in that region. She was also one of the most successful steamers in her class, logging over 1 million miles of service. In 1915 she became the first vessel to reach the upper reaches of the Grand Canyon.  Nenana was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964 and is currently preserved as a museum ship in Nenana, Alaska.

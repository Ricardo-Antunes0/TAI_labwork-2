The Indian Century is the idea that the 21st century will be an era of great progress and significance for India. The phrase was first coined in 2001 by the Indian business magnate N.R. Narayana Murthy, and has been used in various contexts to refer to the prospects for India's economy, society, and culture.  The Indian Century is widely seen as a time of opportunity for India, with its large population and market potential. The country is also expected to play an increasingly important role in global affairs, with its growing economic power and increasing diplomatic clout.  The Indian Century has been marked by a number of significant developments in India, including improvements in health care, education, infrastructure, and public safety. Additionally, the country has seen a rise in the numbers of women and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) politicians in national governments.

Sago Lane  is a one-way lane in Chinatown within the Outram Planning Area in Singapore. The street links Banda Street to Neil Road.  In the past, the street was much longer and was home to funeral parlours or death houses. Part of the street was demolished in the late 1960s due to the construction of the new HDB development at Kreta Ayer, also known as Chinatown Complex. Currently the street, is mainly used during Chinese New Year as part of the festive bazaar in Chinatown. Some mistaken Sago Street as sei yan gai or the "street of the dead", but it is actually on Sago Lane. Sago Street was where brothels were located. Sago Lane is known as ho ba ni au koi in Hokkien, which literally means "the street behind Ho Man Nin". Ho Man Nin is the chop  of a well known singing hall in neighbouring Sago Street.

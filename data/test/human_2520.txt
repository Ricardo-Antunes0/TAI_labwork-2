Brice Meuleman, S.J., D.D. (1 March 1862, Ghent, Belgium – 15 July 1924, Marsailles, France), was a Jesuit priest, a missionary in British India, and the second Archbishop of Calcutta (now Kolkata). Early years Brixius Meuleman was born on 1 March 1862 in Ghent, one of the six sons of Desiderius (also Desiré) Meuleman (1821–1898), a soapmaker (zeepzieder), and his wife, Maria Coleta De Smet (b. 1826).  But his parents actually came from Sint-Lievens-Houtem, a Dutch speaking village 10 miles (17.5 km) southeast of Ghent in East Flanders, where their families had already been living for several generations.  Brixius was named in honor of St. Brixius, the 4th Bishop of Tours, whose feast day was actually on 13 November.  But, like the saint’s name, his name was spelled, in his years as the Archbishop, by the reports, newspapers and magazines as Brice in English and French, Brixius in Dutch and Latin, Brizio in Italian and Brictius in German, the dominant languages of the Archdiocese of Calcutta.

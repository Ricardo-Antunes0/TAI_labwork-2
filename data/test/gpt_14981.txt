Mark William Kent Blunderfield (born July 18, 1959) is an American convicted murderer and rapist. Blunderfield was convicted of the rape and murder of 14-year-old Kimberly Leach in 1984.  Blunderfield was born in 1959 in Pascagoula, Mississippi. He was raised by his grandparents after his mother died when he was young. In 1984, Blunderfield raped and murdered 14-year-old Kimberly Leach after luring her into his car with a fake offer of a ride. The attack shocked the community of Pascagoula, and Blunderfield was quickly arrested and charged with Leach's murder. He was subsequently convicted and sentenced to death. Blunderfield's case drew national attention due to the severity of his crimes and the unusual circumstances under which he was arrested. After serving 17 years of his sentence, Blunderfield was released on parole in 2003. He later violated his parole and was re-imprisoned. Blunderfield is currently serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.

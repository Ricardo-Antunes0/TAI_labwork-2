Molniya  was an explosive device used by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It was a large, cylindrical bomb that used a triggered explosive charge to detonate its payload.  Molniya bombs were designed to be dropped from aircraft, and their large size made them very effective against targets such as airfields and bunkers. They were also used in limited numbers in combat, most notably during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

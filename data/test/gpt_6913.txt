The Russian Liberation Movement  was a nationalist movement in Russia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Russian Liberation Movement emerged in response to the Tsarist government's policies of Russification, which sought to make Russian the only official language of the Empire and to assimilate non-Russian minorities into Russian culture. The Russian Liberation Movement aimed to end Russian imperial rule and create a federal republic in which all ethnic groups could live in equality.  The Russian Liberation Movement was strongest in regions with a large non-Russian population, such as Belarus, Ukraine, and Transcaucasia. The movement was also strong in areas with a strong Russified population, such as Imperial Russia and parts of the Soviet Union. Despite its limited success, the Russian Liberation Movement played an important role in the development of Russian nationalism and helped to spark the Russian Revolution of 1917.

Tropicana Field, also commonly known as The Trop, is a Major League Baseball stadium located in St. Petersburg, Florida. It is the home of the Tampa Bay Rays and has a seating capacity of 36,000.  The Trop was originally built in 1968 as the St. Petersburg-Tampa Stadium as part of a public-private partnership between the city of St. Petersburg and local businesses. The stadium was renovated in 1997 and 2002, both times with help from then-Rays majority owner Stuart Sternberg. The most recent renovation was completed in 2014 and cost $38 million. The Trop has been the home of the Rays since their inaugural season in 1998.  The Trop is best known for its retractable roof, which is one of only two in Major League Baseball (the other being Dodger Stadium's). The roof is open for all games during the summer months and closed for all games during the winter months. It has also been used for various other events, such as concerts and high school football games.

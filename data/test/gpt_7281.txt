The Mobile and Ohio Railroad Depot is a historic train station in Murphysboro, Illinois. It was built in 1892 for the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, and is a fine example of Romanesque Revival architecture. The station was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.  The Murphysboro station is located at the northeast corner of Main and Green Streets in Murphysboro, Illinois. The depot is a single-story brick structure, with a gabled roof and cross-gabled ends. The exterior features rusticated stone trim, and a projecting central tower with a round-arched entranceway. The interior features a waiting room on the east side, with two small baggage rooms on the west side.  The Mobile and Ohio Railroad was chartered in 1881, and began service to Murphysboro in 1892. The depot was designed by George W. Maher, who also designed the nearby agricultural college. The depot served as the primary passenger rail facility for Murphysboro for over a century, until Amtrak discontinued service to Murphysboro in 1984. The depot continued to serve local freight traffic until 2003, when it was closed due to lack of customers. Since then, the depot has been used for storage and occasional events.

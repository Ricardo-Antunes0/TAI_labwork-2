In classic Korean literature, a heroic novel is a novel that typically focuses on a central male character and his heroic deeds. Typical heroic themes include loyalty, bravery, and honor. These novels are often set in ancient Korea or during the Joseon Dynasty, and often feature a strong focus on martial arts.  Today, Korean heroic novels continue to be popular, and have been adapted for film and television. They are often seen as a source of inspiration for young people, and are frequently used in school curriculums across the country.

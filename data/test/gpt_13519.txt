Regional Training Regiments (abbreviated Rindam) are Indonesian military units that are tasked with training and preparing the country's armed forces for combat operations.  The first Rindam were founded in 1920, during the Dutch colonial period. They were initially known as "Pesawat Angkatan Darat" (Air Force Squadron), and served as a reserve unit for the Indonesian National Army. In 1949, the Rindam were reorganized into military training regiments, and have since served as the backbone of Indonesia's military training program.  Today, Rindam comprise over 40 different units, with personnel drawn from all branches of the Indonesian military. They are responsible for training new recruits, conducting combat operations, and serving as a reserve unit for the Indonesian National Army.

StoneHammer Brewing was located in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, from its inception in 1996 until the end of operations in 2012.     In March of that year, the brewery was purchased by F&M Brewery Ltd., a Quebec-based brewery. The new owners decided to keep the StoneHammer name and logo, and continue production as a contract brewer for other breweries. Production of StoneHammer's own beers ceased in late 2012.     StoneHammer is best known for its Hammer IPA, which has been named one of the top 50 IPAs in North America by RateBeer.com. The brewery also produced a variety of other styles, including an Oktoberfest, an amber ale, a lager, and a Belgian-style Witbier.

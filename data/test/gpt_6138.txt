The Classic Lake Conference was a conference of the Big Ten Conference in men's basketball. Held annually from 1986 to 2003, it was one of the oldest conferences in college basketball.  The conference was formed when the Big Ten added two members, Indiana and Purdue, in 1953. The conference originally consisted of seven schools, but expanded to ten members in 1956 with the addition of Illinois and Northwestern. In 1960, Michigan State joined the conference, and in 1981, Iowa State also joined. The conference dropped to nine members in 1982 when Minnesota left for the ACC, but expanded to ten again with the addition of Ohio State in 1985. When Nebraska joined the Big Ten in 2011, the conference had 11 members.  With eleven members, the Classic Lake Conference was one of the largest men's basketball conferences in NCAA Division I basketball. In 2003, however, Nebraska left for the Big Ten Conference and was replaced by Penn State, which caused the conference to be reduced to ten members once again. In 2011, Illinois also departed for the Big Ten Conference, leaving the conference with a total of nine members as of 2019.

The "Dragons" armchair (French: "Fauteuil aux Dragons") is a piece of furniture designed by the Irish architect and designer Eileen Gray between 1917 and 1919. "Dragons" armchair sold for €21,905,000 in 2009, establishing a new record for a piece of 20th century decorative art. Design The chair is a wooden upholstered armchair featuring two stylized lacquered dragons. It measures 61 by 91 cm.   The chair was described by auctioneers Christie's as being: "In the form of unfurling petals, upholstered in brown leather, the frame in sculpted wood, lacquered brownish orange and silver and modelled as the serpentine, intertwined bodies of two dragons, their eyes in black lacquer on a white ground, their bodies decorated in low relief with stylised clouds." Christie's additionally felt that the chair "...distills all that was so personal and so magical in the first, intimately expressive phase of Miss Gray's career — surprising, imaginative, subtly sculpted and crafted, it is a masterpiece of invention and execution." Jennifer Goff, the curator of the National Museum of Ireland's permanent exhibition of Gray's work, felt that the chair was the "perfect example of the designer who created it – completely unique [and] rather eccentric".

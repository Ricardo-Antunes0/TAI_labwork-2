Remote sensing in oceanography is a widely used observational technique which enables researchers to acquire data of a location without physically measuring at that location. Remote sensing in oceanography mostly refers to measuring properties of the ocean surface with sensors on satellites or planes, which compose an image of captured electromagnetic radiation. A remote sensing instrument can either receive radiation from the earthâ€™s surface (passive), whether reflected from the sun or emitted, or send out radiation to the surface and catch the reflection (active). All remote sensing instruments carry a sensor to capture the intensity of the radiation at specific wavelength windows, to retrieve a spectral signature for every location. The physical and chemical state of the surface determines the emissivity and reflectance for all bands in the electromagnetic spectrum, linking the measurements to physical properties of the surface. Unlike passive instruments, active remote sensing instruments also measure the two-way travel time of the signal; which is used to calculate the distance between the sensor and the imaged surface. Remote sensing satellites often carry other instruments which keep track of their location and measure atmospheric conditions. Remote sensing observations, in comparison to (most) physical observations, are consistent in time and have good spatial coverage. Since the ocean is fluid, it is constantly changing on different spatial and temporal scales. Capturing the spatial variation of the ocean with remote sensing is considered extremely valuable and is on the frontier of oceanographic research. The high variability of the ocean surface is also the deterministic factor in the differences between land and ocean remote sensing.

Seiichi Sugano (菅野誠一 17 December 1939 – 29 August 2010) was a Japanese Aikido instructor who lived and taught in many Western countries.  He held the rank of an 8th dan Aikikai. Life Sugano was born in Otaru, Hokkaido. Sugano studied judo for six years when, around the age of 18, he went to train in aikido. Sugano entered the Aikikai Hombu Dojo in 1957 and by 1959 was an Uchi-deshi of Morihei Ueshiba living at the main school. In 1965 he was appointed by Ueshiba to introduce aikido in Australia. He remained there for 15 years, founding the organization Aiki Kai Australia. At the request of Nobuyoshi Tamura, Sugano went to Europe, living and teaching in Belgium while instructing in Luxembourg, France and other European countries. In 1988 he moved to New York City where he co-instructed with Yoshimitsu Yamada at the New York Aikikai. From 1988 forward Sugano's primary instruction was at New York Aikikai teaching over 200 classes a year, despite a grueling travel schedule. Due to Yamada's strong dislike of weapons Sugano almost exclusively taught body arts and tanto instruction at New York Aikikai, emphasizing a joyful, spontaneous and exceptionally physical practice. While always stating, "Aikido is not martial art" Sugano strongly emphasized atemi and martial application saying, "now smash head", "here break arm" in technical application in his New York instruction.

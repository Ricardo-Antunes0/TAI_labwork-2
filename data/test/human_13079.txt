Zabdiel Adams (November 5, 1739 â€“ March 1, 1801), minister of Lunenburg, Massachusetts, was born in Braintree, now Quincy. His father was the uncle of John Adams, second President of the United States. He graduated from Harvard University in 1759. He was ordained September 5, 1764. History  Adams was eminent as a preacher of the gospel, "often explaining the most important doctrines in a rational and scriptural manner, and enforcing them with plainness and pungency. His language was nervous, and while in his public performances he gave instruction he also imparted pleasure. In his addresses to the throne of grace he was remarkable for pertinency of thought and readiness of utterance. Though by bodily constitution he was liable to irritation, yet he held no ill will. His heart was easily touched by the afflictions of others and his sympathy and benevolence prompted him to administer relief, when in his power."

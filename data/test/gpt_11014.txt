The Bournonville House, located at Slotsgade 9, in central Copenhagen, Denmark, is a large Neoclassical-style country house. Designed by Christian Frederik Hansen and built from 1818 to 1824, it is one of the finest examples of early neoclassical architecture in Denmark.  The house was originally built for Count Christian August Bournonville, a wealthy aristocrat and patron of the arts. It has been the home of the Danish Royal Family since 1918. It is open to the public as a museum.

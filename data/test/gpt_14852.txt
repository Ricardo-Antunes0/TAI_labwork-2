1916 is the ninth studio album by English rock band the Beatles, released on 10 November 1966 by Parlophone. It was the band's last album with original drummer Pete Best before he was replaced by Ringo Starr.  The album was recorded in eight days at Trident Studios in London and produced by George Martin. It features the single "Let It Be", which became their fourth number one hit in the United Kingdom.

The song underwent numerous rewrites before Martin was satisfied with its final form. "I Want To Hold Your Hand" was originally written as a slow ballad, but Lennon reworked it into a faster-paced number after being inspired

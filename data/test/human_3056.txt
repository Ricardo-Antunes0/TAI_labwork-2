The RDS-2 nuclear warhead was created and designed by the Soviet Union during the late 1940s and early 1950s.  RDS-2 was first secretly tested on September 24, 1951 at a Soviet test site in Kazakhstan. RDS-2 was a plutonium only device with an estimated yield of 38 kt. Leading to the Bomb  By the end of the 1940s, the Department of Scientific and Technical Intelligence of NKVD had begun to target nuclear projects in Great Britain, France, and Germany. The Soviet intelligence agency obtained a report by the Maud Committee of Great Britain that analyzed the possibility of a nuclear weapons program gaining traction in Great Britain. However, World War II forced the Soviet Union to shift their efforts towards the war. The Russian Atomic project wouldn’t gain traction till early 1943 when physicist Igor V. Kurchatov, the scientific director of the Soviet nuclear project, wrote to secret police chief Lavrenti Beria, whom Joseph Stalin had given principal responsibility for the atomic effort.  The nuclear project was approved on February 11, 1943 after inquires with atomic research institutes such as the Institute of Chemical Physics of the Academy of Sciences and other design bureaus that were already developing atomic components and equipment. Nuclear Weapons research and development was carried out by the Minatom’s Department of Nuclear Weapons Development and Testing. The department managed six institutes: the Institute of Experimental Physics (Arzamas-16), the Institute of Technical Physics (Chelyabinsk-70), the Institute of Impulse Technologies (VNII IT), and the Design Bureau of Road Transportation Equipment (KB ATO)  but Arzamas-16 and Chelyabinsk-70 focused on weapons development. Design Bureau 11 (KB-11) was the primary institute that designed and tested nuclear weapons.

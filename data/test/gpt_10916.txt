The GR is operated by the Florida Department of Corrections (FDOC).  The GR is named for Thomas Goree, an American slave who was hanged in 1857 in Tallahassee, Florida. Goree was a slave who attempted to escape from his plantation and was captured by slave hunters. After being brought back to his plantation, he was tortured and killed by his captors.

Thread seal tape (also known as PTFE tape, or Teflon tape) is a type of tape made from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is a synthetic non-toxic polymer. It is a material used in various types of products, including plumbing, electrical wiring, and food packaging.  Thread seal tape is often used to seal gaps and joints in piping systems, as it is resistant to water, oil, and other chemicals. It is also used in manufacturing to create airtight seals between parts.

Tecno is an Italian kart and former racing car constructor based in Bologna. It won the European Formula Two Championship in 1970 and became a Formula One constructor, participating in 10 grands prix and scoring one championship point. History Tecno started out as an engineering business in Bologna manufacturing hydraulic pumps. In 1961, the company's owners, brothers Luciano and Gianfranco Pederzani, decided to enter motor sport as constructors of karts. In 1966 the company moved on up into car racing with Formula 3. Swiss driver Clay Regazzoni scored Tecno's first international win in Spain in 1967 and by the end of the year Tecno had won 32 of the season's 65 major F3 races. Tecno was the first company to build an offset ('sidewinder') kart chassis to take advantage of the newly developed air-cooled rotary motors produced by Parilla. Tecno's first chassis was named the Kaimano (a play on the Italian word for the Camen crocodile and the source of the logo). The Kaimano's design was based on the American rear-engine karts of the early 1960s. The second chassis, the Piuma ('Feather'), revolutionized karting design, and was so successful that it won the World Championships in 1964, 1965 and 1966. In 1969 Ronnie Peterson drove for the team, winning 15 races. In 1970 Tecno debuted in Formula 2 and won that year's championship with Regazzoni.

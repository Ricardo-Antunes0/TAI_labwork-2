Antrodiaetus is a genus of American and European spider beetles. It is the only genus in the family Antrodiaetidae. They are small to medium-sized beetles, usually black or dark brown, with metallic green or blue reflections on their elytra. They are found in North America and Europe.  The genus contains about 35 species, distributed across six continents. Some of these species are widely known and commonly encountered, such as the common house spider (Antrodiaetus pulcher), which is the most commonly seen spider in North America, and the European garden spider (Antrodiaetus tredecimguttatus), which is one of the most common spiders in Europe. Other species are less well known but still found across many countries, such as the Australian wandering spider (Antrodiaetus australis), which is an introduced species in many parts of the world.  The genus was first described by Pierre Andr√© Latreille in 1802, based on a specimen collected from Saint-Domingue. The name refers to Antrodiaetus, one of the Titans in Greek mythology.

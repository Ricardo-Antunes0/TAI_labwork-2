Plot  Nagaraju (Satyanarayana) and Janaki (Pushpalata) have been a married couple, but he never felt that she is his wife; he abandons her. Janki gives birth to twins and Seshu (Prabhakar Reddy), a gangster, steals one of them and sells him to a bootlegger, Kunti (Tyagaraju). Nagaraju has taken to crime in a big way and as a result has antagonised a rival gangster, Seshu. Janaki is upset when she finds her son missing, with a lot of difficulties, she brings up her son, Satyam (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) and he is now a dedicated police officer. On the other hand, Kunti has exploited Shivam (N. T. Rama Rao), kept him illiterate, and made him a petty criminal & alcoholic. This gets him into a confrontation with Satyam, but ironically the two settle their differences and become fast friends. Nagaraju is not aware of his two sons and wife being alive. Without revealing his identity, Satyam is appointed to catch Nagaraju's gang and Shivam always supports him and they, together with other police personnel, keep vigil. Things do not go as planned; they are attacked as a result Satyam loses his eyesight, leaving the onus on Shivam to try to locate the person behind this crime.

Zhu Shugui (1617 – 21 July 1683), courtesy name Tianqiu (天球) and art name Yiyuanzi (一元子), the Prince of Changyang (長陽王; 1645–1646), later the Prince of Ningjing (寧靖王), was a royal member of the Ming and the last of the pretenders to the throne of Southern Ming after the execution of the Yongli Emperor in 1662. He took shelter to the Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan after mainland China completely fell under the control of Manchu-led Qing dynasty. Despite his status as a royal member, he virtually shared no political power with the Zheng dynasts whom were the actual rulers of the kingdom. After the Qing forces successfully annexed Taiwan in 1683, he committed suicide. Nowadays there is a temple dedicated to the prince in Lujhu Township. Inside the temple is written Zhu's death poem. Early career  Zhu Shugui was styled the General Who Assists the State (輔國將軍) while living in Jingzhou. He was later granted the title Prince of Changyang during the Regency of the Prince of Lu near the end of the Ming dynasty. In 1642, after the rebel leader Zhang Xianzhong captured Jingzhou, he followed Zhu Changrun, Prince of Hui, to Nanjing. In 1644, the Chongzhen Emperor, the last emperor of the Ming dynasty, committed suicide in Beijing, and China fell into chaos. But Zhu Shugui, living in Nanjing under the auspices of the Prince of Fu, continued to support the legitimacy of the Ming dynasty.

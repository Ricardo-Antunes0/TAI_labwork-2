Alberta Provincial Highway No. 663 is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Alberta. The highway runs from Highway 2 near Wetaskiwin east to Highway 5 near Camrose.  Alberta Highway 663 is a long, rural road that travels through the eastern edge of the province. It connects the communities of Wetaskiwin and Camrose, and is an important route for travellers moving between the eastern and western parts of Alberta. The highway is also important as a transportation route for farmers and ranchers in the area, as it connects major agricultural areas to markets in Edmonton and Calgary.  The highway was established in the 1930s as a gravel road linking Wetaskiwin with Camrose. In the 1940s, the highway was upgraded to a concrete road. In the 1960s, further improvements were made to the highway, including the installation of flashing lights and turn lanes at several intersections. In the 1990s, additional upgrades were made to the highway, including the addition of pavement from Camrose to Highway 5. Today, Alberta Highway 663 is a well-maintained road that provides access to important agricultural areas and markets in central Alberta.

Helen Katharine Forbes (February 3, 1891 – March 2, 1961) was an American heiress and socialite.  Helen Katharine Forbes was born on February 3, 1891, in New York City to advertising executive James Gordon Forbes and his wife, Helen (née Duff). She grew up in a well-to-do family and had two younger sisters: Jean Forbes Duncan and Margaret Forbes Blount. In 1909, her father died at the age of 56, leaving his wife and daughters financially secure.  In 1912, Helen married Burt Ward, a young heir to the du Pont fortune. The couple moved to Europe and became fixtures of the social scene in Paris, London, and Rome. They had two children: Barbara Ward (1915-1994) and Gordon Forbes Ward (1917-1994).  In 1938, Burt Ward died in a car accident. Devastated by her husband's death, Helen returned to the United States and began a new life as a recluse. She made few public appearances and rarely left her home. She died on March 2, 1961 at the age of 73.

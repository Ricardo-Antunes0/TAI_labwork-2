Ruan Yang (Chinese: 阮杨; born 13 December 1969) is a Chinese theoretical physicist who researches the theory of quantum gravity.  Ruan Yang was born in Wuhan, Hubei province, on December 13, 1969. He received his B.S. from Wuhan University in 1991 and his M.S. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1992. He then received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1996 under the supervision of Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg.  Since 1996, Ruan has been a professor at Peking University where he is currently a full professor and the head of the Center for Theoretical Cosmology. His research focuses on the theory of quantum gravity, which seeks to understand the fundamental laws that govern the behavior of matter and energy on the very small scales of particles and fields.  Ruan has been a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences since 2008 and a fellow of both American Physical Society and American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2013, he was awarded the prestigious Peking University Academician Prize for his contributions to theoretical cosmology.

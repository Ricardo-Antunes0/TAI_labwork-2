Justus van Huysum, also spelled Huijsum, (July 8, 1659 in Amsterdam – April 23, 1716 in Amsterdam) was a Dutch Golden Age painter. Biography He was the son of the decorative painter Jan van Huysum I and the brother of the engraver Caspar van Huysum. The elder Jan van Huysum moved to Amsterdam from Huizum (near Leeuwarden) between 1654 and 1657, where his boys Justus and Caspar were born.  According to Houbraken, when Justus came of age, his father sent him to learn painting from Nicolaes Berchem in 1675. Houbraken said he was very good at all sorts of painting, but excelled at flower painting, and founded a family business in painting flowers in vases. He later married and became the father of Jan van Huysum, Jacob van Huysum, and Justus II van Huysum. One painting by him named "Vase of Flowers" was stolen by the Nazis from the Uffizi  Gallery in Florence Italy – it is believed to still exist in Germany.

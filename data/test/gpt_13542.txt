A chemotype (sometimes chemovar) is a chemically defined population of a plant or microorganism. It is a population that has been reproductively isolated by virtue of its chemical characteristics.  Chemotypes are important in crop breeding because they can lead to variation in growth, yield, and chemical composition that can be exploited by farmers. For example, a chemotype that produces a high yield of wheat with low levels of gluten can be selected for inbreeding to create new varieties with greater yields.

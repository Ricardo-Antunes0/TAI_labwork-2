Andrew Joshua Hargrett, Sr. (1879â€“1932) was a pioneering African-American educator who organized Shadeville Elementary School in 1909, the first school for black people in Wakulla County, Florida. In the late 1920s, he also led the crusade to establish Shadeville High School, the county's first high school for black students. His oldest son, Andrew Hargrett II, was in the first graduating class in 1930. For 37 years, Shadeville High School continued to educate students in the area. The school was closed in 1967 after desegregation. On August 21, 1989, the Wakulla County, Florida Commission renamed the road that runs past the site of the former Shadeville High School, in honor of Andrew J. Hargrett, Sr., for his early contributions to education. The Old Shadeville High School Marker can be found at 87 Andrew J. Hargrett, Sr. Road (off County Road 61, east of Crawfordville Highway). The monument was established by the Shadeville High School Alumni Association in 1992.

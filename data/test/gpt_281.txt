A county executive, county manager or county supervisor is a type of local government executive in the United States, Canada, and some other countries. The title is used in 43 U.S. states, 3 Canadian provinces, and 1 Australian state. In these jurisdictions, the executive officer is typically responsible for all or most of the day-to-day operations of the county government, including managing its budget and staff.  County executives are typically elected by the voters of their respective counties and serve terms of four years. In some cases, such as Georgia's Clayton County, the county executive may also serve concurrently as the county's district attorney. In other cases, such as Kern County, California, the county executive is chosen by the board of supervisors rather than elected by the voters.

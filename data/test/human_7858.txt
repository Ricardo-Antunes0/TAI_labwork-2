The William Hurd House is a historic house at 327 Hulls Hill Road in Southbury, Connecticut.  Built in the late 18th century and enlarged about 1820, it is a good local example of Federal period architecture, with well-preserved outbuildings.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The William Hurd House is located in a rural-residential setting in Southbury's Southford area, on the south side of Hulls Hill Road just north of its crossing of Jeremy Brook.  It is a -story wood-frame structure, with a gabled roof, end chimneys, and clapboarded exterior, with ells extending to the right and rear.  The main facade is five bays wide, with windows arranged in a somewhat asymmetrical manner around a nearly centered entrance.  The entry has a fine Federal surround, with sidelights that have pilasters on both sides, and a corniced entablature.  The interior of the main block is largely a reconstruction performed after a 1950 fire, but cased timbers attest to its age and construction history.

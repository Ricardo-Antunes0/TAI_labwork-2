Meisdorf House  is a schloss in the village of Meisdorf in the borough of Falkenstein in the German federal state of Saxony-Anhalt, that is now used as a hotel. It was built in 1708 with a  castle park. History  In the second half of the 18th century Meisdorf and the nearby Falkenstein Castle came into the possession of court official and diplomat, Achatz Ferdinand of Asseburg. Meisdorf had belonged to the seigneurie of Falkenstein since the middle age, and the latter to the House of Asseburg since 1437. As Falkenstein castle, at the time, was only used as a hunting lodge and the old Meisdorf manor had become too small for the needs of the lords, he built this new, more spacious, albeit simple residence in 1787, and had the existing house converted into an official's quarter. The new mansion, of which the facade faced away from the village Meisdorf, was linked with it through an avenue of lime and chestnut trees, 400 paces long.

Betty's Hope was one of the largest sugar plantations in the Antilles, with an area of 350 hectares. The plantation was established in 1794 by the Betty family, who were descendants of English settlers who had arrived in the islands in the early 18th century. The plantation was initially managed by Betty's father, who expanded the land holdings over the years. In 1995, the plantation was auctioned off and later converted into a tourist attraction.

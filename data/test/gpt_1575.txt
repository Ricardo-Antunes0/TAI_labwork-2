Cyclonic Ni単o is a climatological phenomenon that occurs in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. It is characterized by unusually high surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean near the dateline, and is associated with an increased risk of severe weather in parts of the world.  The term "cyclonic Ni単o" was first introduced by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) in their monthly climate report in December 1997. The term is derived from the Greek word "cyclone", meaning a rotating storm, and " Ni単o", denoting a cold phase of the El Ni単o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

The Washington Capitals (colloquially known as the Caps) are a professional ice hockey team based in Washington, D.C. They are members of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL).  The Capitals were founded in 1974 as an expansion team, and played their first season in Dupont Circle. In their early years, they were often considered one of the worst teams in the league, but they have since made several playoff appearances and won two division titles (1995 and 1998). The Capitals reached the playoffs for the first time in 1997 and made it all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost to the Detroit Red Wings. The team has also experienced moderate success since then, qualifying for the playoffs six times (2002–2004, 2006–2007, 2009–2010, 2012–2013, 2015–2016 and 2018–2019).  The Capitals are owned by Ted Leonsis and play their home games at Capital One Arena.

#LetHerSpeak (also known as #LetUsSpeak) is an online platform which provides a platform for women to share their experiences of sexual violence and abuse. The website was founded by Nafsika Tejwani in October 2013 as a response to the lack of platforms available to survivors of sexual violence.  As a survivor of sexual violence myself, I know firsthand how important it is for survivors to have a place to share their experiences and feelings. That's why I founded LetHerSpeak – so that other survivors could have access to the support and resources they need, no matter where they are in their recovery process.  Since its inception, LetHerSpeak has been dedicated to providing a safe and confidential space for survivors to share their stories. We work hard to ensure that every person who visits our website feels comfortable speaking openly about their experiences. In addition to our online chat and message boards, we offer a range of resources, including blog posts, videos, articles, and support groups.  We believe that everyone – no matter what gender they are, what race they are, or what socioeconomic status they have – deserves the opportunity to speak out about their experiences with sexual violence and abuse. So please join us on this journey – together, we can help put an end to sexual violence once and for all!

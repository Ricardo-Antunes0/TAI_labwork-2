The Early Renaissance French  Château de Vallery, located in the commune of Vallery-sur-Saône, was the home of the de Vallery family from about 1250 to 1553.     The château was built on a rocky outcrop on a steep slope above the Saône River, and was surrounded by a large park. Its architecture is a mix of Romanesque and Gothic styles.     The château was damaged during the French Revolution, and was abandoned in the 18th century. It was restored between 1973 and 1982, and is now open to the public.

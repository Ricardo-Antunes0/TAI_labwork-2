(in Finnish; ; "civilian service"), is an alternative service in Finland. It is provided as an alternative to military service for conscientious objectors by Article 127 of the Finnish constitution. The service lasts for 347 days, changed from 395 days in 2008 (not retroactively applied). It can be entered into by filing paperwork indicating that one conscientiously objects to military service. History This alternative service option has existed since 1931 thanks to the efforts of conscientious objector Arndt Pekurinen, although non-religious objections were not allowed until a change of law in 1959. Until 1987, non-religious objections were examined by a Special Commission of Inquiry which was composed of a judge, a military officer, a representative of the social ministry, and a psychiatrist. Today, simply filing the correct paperwork suffices, and as such, many people opt for it simply as an alternative to military service while not having any special objections. An emergency state (in case of war, for example) still allows the usage of Special Commissions of Inquiry.

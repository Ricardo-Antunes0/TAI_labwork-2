Henry Forbes Bigelow (1867 â€“ 1929) was a Boston architect, best known for his work with the firm of Bigelow & Wadsworth. He was noted as an architect of civic, commercial and domestic buildings. In an obituary, his contemporary William T. Aldrich wrote that "...Mr. Bigelow probably contributed more to the creation of charming and distinguished house interiors than any one person of his time." Early life and career Henry Forbes Bigelow was born May 12, 1867 in Clinton, Massachusetts to Henry Nelson Bigelow (1839-1907) and Clarissa Nichols (Forbes) Bigelow (1841-1876). His father was managing agent of the Bigelow Carpet Company of Clinton, which had been founded by his father and uncle. He graduated from St. Mark's School (1884) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1888). In 1889 he was selected as architect of the new buildings of St. Mark's, his preparatory school, where his father had been a trustee since 1883. As he lacked a practice of his own, construction of the building was entrusted to architects from the Boston firm of Winslow & Wetherell. Bigelow traveled abroad for several months during construction, and when he returned to Boston he entered the office of Winslow & Wetherell as an architect.

The Bay–Biñan Transmission Line (abbreviated as 8LI1BIN-BYZ, also known as the Bay–San Mateo Transmission Line) is a high-voltage direct-current transmission line in the Philippines. It is operated by the National Transmission Corporation (NTC) and carries electric power from the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant in Batangas to San Mateo in Laguna province.  The 8LI1BIN-BYZ line was originally planned to be built in the 1970s, but construction was delayed due to concerns about earthquakes and typhoons. The line began operations in 1984 and had an initial capacity of 1,000 megawatts. It was expanded to 2,500 megawatts in 2004 and 3,000 megawatts in 2007. The 8LI1BIN-BYZ line is expected to have a lifespan of at least 50 years.

Para-swimming classification is a function-based classification system used to classify swimmers with disabilities. The system was first developed in the early 1990s by Dr. Ken Weidner and associates at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Para-swimming classification is based on an individual's Functional Abilities Profile (FAP), which is a standard measure of an individual's overall functional abilities. The FAP is based on a set of questions that measure an individual's ability to do basic activities of daily living, such as bathing, dressing, cooking, and cleaning.  The para-swimming classification system is broken down into five levels: A, B, C, D, and E. Level A includes the most able-bodied swimmers and Level E includes the most disabled swimmers. Levels B through D are further divided into para-swimming disciplines, such as breaststroke and backstroke.  The para-swimming classification system is used to determine eligibility for various para-swimming competitions and grants financial assistance to para-swimmers who compete in international events.

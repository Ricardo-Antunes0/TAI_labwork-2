The Michniów massacre occurred on 12–13 July 1941, during the Second World War, when the German Wehrmacht perpetrated a massacre of Poles in the town of Michniów, located in eastern Poland.  The massacre took place during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, and is thought to have involved the execution of around 2,000 Polish civilians, including women and children.

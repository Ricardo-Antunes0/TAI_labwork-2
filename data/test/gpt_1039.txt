In a representative democracy, a paper candidate is an individual who attempts to run for political office without actually committing to doing so. This is typically done as a publicity stunt or in order to raise awareness of a candidate's candidacy without actually campaigning.  Paper candidates are most commonly used in student elections, where they allow more candidates to be on the ballot than would be possible if they were required to commit to running. They are also used in some municipal elections, where there are fewer than the number of seats available for election.  Paper candidates may also be used in other circumstances where it is impractical or impossible for a candidate to campaign in person. For example, a paper candidate may stand for office in a country that does not have a voting system in which citizens cast ballots directly.

The Anhak Palace was the royal residence of the Goguryeo Kingdom after the capital was moved to Pyongyang from Gungnae. Originally built in 427 AD, the palace is located in the Taesong District of Pyongyang, North Korea, at the foot of Mount Taesong. The layout of the palace closely followed Korean architecture system using Korean fortress system. It was the palace where the king usually lived. The nobility and ordinary people lived outside this castle, and the outer fortress surrounding the urban area was present. There was a moat outside the east and west walls of the palace. The inside of the complex was composed of large separate palaces and corridors, as well as artificial gardens and lakes. 52 palace sites were identified. It was built after the transfer of the capital to Pyongyang, during which political groups familiar with Korean culture became a new bureaucratic group under the king's patronage.

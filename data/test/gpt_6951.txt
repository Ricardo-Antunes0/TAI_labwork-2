A CubeSat (U-class spacecraft) is a type of small satellite, typically about five inches square, made primarily of plastic or other inexpensive materials and launched into orbit as a secondary payload on a larger spacecraft.  Since the early 1990s, CubeSats have been used to conduct research in a variety of fields, including Earth science, planetary exploration, and astronomy. They are also popular among amateur satellite enthusiasts. As of early 2019, there are more than 1,000 CubeSats in orbit.

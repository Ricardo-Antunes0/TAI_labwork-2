Gohar Dashti (born 1980 in Ahvaz, Iran) is an Iranian photographer and video artist who lives and works in Tehran. The dominant theme in her work is her native country, its topography and history of violence. Her work has traveled internationally and she has had many solo exhibitions. She studied photography at the University of Tehran and graduated with an M.A. in 2005. During her studies and throughout her life, she noticed the impact the Iranâ€“Iraq War had on her country. Dashti's earlier work looks at the lasting effects of the war on the people and the land. In this way, she is considered to be a conflict photographer, but her work contrasts with the stark photojournalism that often is produced to represent the effect that war has on a country and its people. In 2017, her practice shifted slightly. Dashti began investigating the natural world. Though the subject matter differs from her earlier work, her practice at its core is still rooted in her country, its culture and her experiences within these.

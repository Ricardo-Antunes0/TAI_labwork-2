The Adriatic Abyssal Plain, more commonly referred to as the Adriatic Basin, is a geological basin located in southeastern Europe. It is bounded by the Alps to the north, the Apennines to the west, and by the Dinaric Alps and the Gulf of Trieste to the south. The Adriatic Basin is a rift valley that extends from the eastern Alps to the western Apennines.  The Adriatic Basin formed about 125 million years ago as a result of the collision of two continents, land that now makes up Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Italy and Albania was then part of Gondwana. About 50 million years ago, during the Paleogene period, the basin started to rift along its eastern edge. The rift widened and deepened until it created an abyssal plain. About 5 million years ago, during the Neogene period, another rift opened up along the southern edge of the basin. This allowed waters from the Mediterranean Sea to flood into it. The new water filled up the rift and created an extended coastline. The Adriatic Basin has been slowly filling ever since.

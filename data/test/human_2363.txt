Starting in 2014, the pair began working on remixes for acts like The Chainsmokers, Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish, Galantis, and numerous others. In 2019, they began releasing original music for the first time with the single, "Starry Eyes", which reached No. 31 on the Dance Club Songs chart. History Tristan Norton and Martin Kottmeier are both natives of Vancouver, British Columbia and met while playing in different bands in high school. The two began making music together and eventually moved to Los Angeles to form part of the backing band for a pop artist. They moved back to Vancouver some time after and began writing jingles, including one for Pizza Hut. The two also initially wanted to form an indie rock band. The name "Young Bombs" comes from a short-lived band they formed with another friend. The two decided to focus on EDM after Kottmeier took an interest in the genre.

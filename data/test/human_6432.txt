John Lee Lee (11 December 1802 – 16 August 1874) of Orleigh Court in the parish of Buckland Brewer in Devon, and of Dillington House, near Ilminster in Somerset, was a British Whig politician who was Member of Parliament for Wells in Somerset between 1830 and 1837. He was Sheriff of Somerset in 1845–6. He was born "John Lee Hanning", the only son and heir of William Hanning (died 1834) of Dillington House, near Ilminster in Somerset by his wife Harriett Lee, daughter of Edward Lee of  Pinhoe, Devon. In 1819 at the age of 17, by the will of his uncle Major Edward Lee (d.17 January 1819) of Orleigh, he inherited several estates including Orleigh. Under the terms of the bequest he adopted the surname Lee by royal licence dated 21 March 1825. He let Orleigh to his brother-in-law William Speke of Jordans near Ilminster (father of the River Nile explorer John Hanning Speke (1827–1864)) and made his own residence at Dillington.

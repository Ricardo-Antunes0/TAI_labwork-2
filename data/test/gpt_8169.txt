A biohybrid solar cell is a solar cell that uses organic materials to create the electronic devices and circuits within it. The organic materials allow for solar cells to be flexible, lightweight, and more powerful than traditional solar cells. Biohybrid solar cells can also be designed to be more environmentally friendly, as they do not require the use of harmful chemicals or metal materials.

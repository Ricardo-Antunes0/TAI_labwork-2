History  Tapioca Express was first founded in August 1999 in Alhambra, California, within Los Angeles County. The company soon expanded, with two more stores opening in Northern California in 2000. These two were both franchises, setting the model for future expansion of the brand. As Tapioca Express grew in popularity, so did their menu selection. By 2002, they had over a hundred drink choices and Italian Expresso was introduced into all stores. By the end of 2002, Tapioca Express had over 45 franchises, extending beyond their original home state of California. Tapioca Express had goals to open over 100 franchises by 2009, however, the 2008 recession caused many stores to shut down, putting the company in a delicate situation financially. The company then was restructured in year 2009 and regained its margin and market share about 40% annual growth from year 2010 to 2014. As of July 2018, Tapioca Express has 38 locations in California, Washington, and Texas.

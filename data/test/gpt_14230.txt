Venetiana "Veza" Taubner-Calderon Canetti (Vienna, 1897 – Madrid, 1977) was an Austrian writer, who became one of the most celebrated authors of Spanish literature.   Canetti was born in Vienna to a Jewish family. His parents were both academics and Canetti spent much of his childhood travelling between Austria, Germany, and Italy. After studying at the University of Vienna, he served in World War I before moving to Berlin in 1923. In Berlin, he became involved with the avant-garde and began writing poetry and short stories.  In 1933, Canetti left Germany for Spain after the Nazi takeover. He initially lived in Madrid but relocated to Barcelona in 1941 due to the war. In Barcelona, he began a lifelong friendship with the writer Federico García Lorca. He also began writing novels and became one of Spain's most celebrated authors.  Canetti's work often explores the themes of human existence and identity. His best-known works include The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (1938), Death in Venice (1948), and Crowds and Power (1957). He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1971.

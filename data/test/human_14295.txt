Sarah, also known as Sahara, ( 2001–January 22, 2016) was a female South African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus) that lived in the Cincinnati Zoo in Cincinnati, Ohio. Sarah was known as the world's fastest land mammal according to National Geographic magazine. She ran 100 meters in 5.95 seconds (more precisely, 5.9564 seconds and up to 61 miles an hour (98 km/h)) in 2012, when she was 11 years old. She died on January 22, 2016, at the age of 15. Sarah came to the Cincinnati Zoo when she was six weeks old and was raised by Cathryn Hilker, who was the founder of the Zoo's Cat Ambassador Program. Sarah was one of the first cheetah cubs to be raised with a puppy companion, who was named Alexa. Throughout her time at the zoo, Sarah had many trainers, but her favorite was the trainer who raised her, Cathryn Hilker. When it came to completing tasks, Sarah would challenge every trainer except Cathryn; they had a relationship that every trainer would want to have. Even when Sarah was retired, Cathryn visited her often.

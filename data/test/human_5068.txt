Milne Hollow is a 50-hectare (120-acre) valley site in Toronto, Ontario, Canada within the valley of the East Don River. It is located in north-west central Toronto where the Don Valley Parkway intersects with Lawrence Avenue East. It was the location of pioneer Alexander Milne's mill town known as Milnesford Mills and his homestead farm. Today it is dominated by transportation uses, (including two rail lines, an expressway and an arterial road) with parkland alongside. The parkland has seen recent naturalization efforts by the City of Toronto government and volunteer organizations, including the opening of the East Don Trail in 2012. Description Milne Hollow is a wide section of the valley of the East Don River. It was first inhabited by Europeans in the 19th century. The Milne family set up a pioneer farm and mill on the river. The river itself flows from the north-west to the south-east of the hollow. To the north-west and south-east, the river floodplains are forested. Along the south and west slopes of the hollow, the Canadian National rail line crosses the hollow, following the river valley. Along north-south lines, the Don Valley Parkway descends into the hollow where a large interchange exists for access to Lawrence Avenue, an arterial road crossing the hollow on an east-west direction.

HMS Bellerophon, known to sailors as the "Swan of the Seas", was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched at Woolwich on 9 February 1786.  Bellerophon was one of a new breed of ships designed by Sir John Jervis, which combined the firepower and sailing capabilities of a frigate with the accommodation and stability of a third rate. She saw extensive service in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, fought in almost every major action of the Napoleonic Wars and was present at the Battle of Copenhagen. Bellerophon became famous for being the only British ship to escape from the Battle of Trafalgar.  After serving in the Channel Fleet for some time, Bellerophon was sent to North America in 1814 during the War of 1812. She participated in many actions against American forces, including the Battle of Lake Erie and Battle of Detroit. In 1815 she was sent back to Europe and took part in several more battles before being decommissioned in 1819.  Bellerophon was restored to service as a coastguard ship in 1837 and served until she was retired in 1870. After her retirement she was sold for breaking up and she arrived at Port Glasgow on 24 October 1870.

Eleven Chorale Preludes, Op. 122, is a set of eleven chorale preludes written by Johannes Brahms. Originally published in 1876, the pieces are for organ or choir and are often performed as part of a choral concert.  The preludes are generally in a moderate tempo and are written in a style that is characterized by its melodic and harmonic simplicity. The pieces are generally short, lasting around two minutes each, and are often sung or played unaccompanied.  The preludes were written during Brahms's time as a professor at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Dresden and reflect his interest in early German chorale music. The preludes are sometimes seen as an important part of his work as a composer of choral music, and have been praised by many critics.

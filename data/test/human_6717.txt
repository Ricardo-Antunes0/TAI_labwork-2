Prasophyllum praecox, commonly known as the early leek orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to eastern Australia. It has a single tubular leaf and up to ten green to greenish brown and white flowers and is found in the southern parts of the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. Description Prasophyllum praecox is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single dark green, tube-shaped leaf  long and  wide near its purplish base. Between about four and ten green to greenish brown and white flowers are arranged along a flowering spike  long. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped to narrow egg-shaped,  long and about  wide. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped,  long and about  wide and are free each other. The petals are linear in shape,  long and  wide. The labellum is white,  long,  wide and turns upwards at about 90Â° near its middle. The upturned part has wavy edges and there is a broad egg-shaped, yellowish green callus with a dark green centre, in the middle of the labellum. Flowering occurs from late July to September.

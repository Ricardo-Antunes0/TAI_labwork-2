The Winchuck River (Tolowa: duu-sr-xuu-shi taa-ghin-li~') is a short coastal stream that runs through the Rogue River–Siskiyou National Forest to the Pacific Ocean in the U.S. states of Oregon and California. Flowing generally west from its origin near Elk Mountain, the river enters the sea at Crissey Field State Recreation Site, about  north of the Oregon–California border and about  south of Brookings. Formed by the confluence of Fourth of July Creek and Bear Creek in southern Curry County, the river flows generally west. Just below the source, Salmon Creek enters from the left, then Elk Creek and Deer Creek enter from the right. Further downstream, the Winchuck receives Moser Creek and the South Fork Winchuck River, both from the left. The river then leaves Oregon, flowing in Del Norte County, California, for a short distance before re-entering Oregon. The Winchuck passes under U.S. Route 101 in Oregon just before reaching the ocean. Winchuck River Road runs along or near the north side of the river for much of its course.

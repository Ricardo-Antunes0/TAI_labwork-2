Pi Mensae (Ï€ Men), also known as HD 39091, is a yellow dwarf star in the constellation of Mensa. This star has a high proper motion. The apparent magnitude is 5.67, which can be visible to the naked eye in exceptionally dark, clear skies. It is nearly 60 light-years away. The star is slightly larger than the Sun in terms of mass, size, luminosity, temperature and metallicity, and is about 730 million years younger. It hosts two known planets. Planetary system On October 15, 2001, an extrasolar planet was found orbiting the star. Pi Mensae b is one of the most massive planets ever discovered, and has a very eccentric orbit that takes approximately  to complete. Because of its eccentricity, and being a massive brown dwarf that passes through the habitable zone, it would have disrupted the orbits of any Earth-like planets, and possibly thrown them into the star, or out into the interstellar medium.

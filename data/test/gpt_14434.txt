The 1912 Giro d'Italia was the fourthÂ edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The race began on 24 May in Milan and ended on 9 June in Brescia, covering a total of 2,403 kilometres (1,496 mi). Italian rider Costante Girardengo won the race, completing the course in just under sixty days.  The 1912 Giro was the first Grand Tour of the modern era. It was also the first time that cyclists could use bicycles with fixed gears, which made for a much more efficient race. The Giro also introduced the team format, with each rider on a team representing a sponsor. This made for much more competition and gave riders a chance to gain publicity and sponsorships.

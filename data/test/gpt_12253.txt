Paulinella is a genus of about nine known species of sea snail, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Muricidae, the murex snails.  The genus Paulinella was named after the French zoologist Pauline Loyer.  Species within the genus Paulinella include:   The shells of these sea snails are quite robust and can reach a size of up to 60Â mm. The exterior of these shells is covered in small pits and ridges, giving them a somewhat rough appearance. The color of these shells can vary from light brown to dark brown, with some species having a reddish hue. The inside of these shells is usually a light cream color. Paulinella species are usually found off the coasts of Europe and North America, but have also been found as far south as Brazil and Argentina. They are usually found in relatively shallow water, but can also be found in deeper waters. These snails feed on algae and small creatures that they capture using their strong jaws.

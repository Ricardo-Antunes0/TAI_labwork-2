Ali Ahmed Aldairy  is a Bahraini author, editor, cultural critic and activist. He holds a PhD in speech analysis and wrote several books. He had also started his blog "Hawamel Aldairy" (in Arabic: هوامل الديري).  Following the Bahraini uprising of 2011, he went into exile in Lebanon and founded Bahrain Mirror newspaper. He moved to Canada in 2016. On 31 January 2015, Aldairy along with three other journalists had their nationality revoked by the Ministry of Interior (MoI). They and sixty-eight other citizens were accused by the government of supporting terrorism and spreading misinformation. There was no trial, as the MoI, according to Bahrain's citizenship law has the right to withdraw the nationality of anyone with questionable loyality to Bahrain.  The Committee to Protect Journalists described the decision as a punishment for journalists who are critical of the government. Reporters Without Borders also described the decision as a penalty for journalists who don't "toe the government line". Aldairy considered the official justifications, and the inclusion of four known terrorists alongside political dissedents as an attempt to muddy the waters.

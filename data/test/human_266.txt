Nova Classical Academy is a K–12 charter school in St. Paul, Minnesota, that follows the classical model for education. Its executive director is Dr. Brett Wedlund, and it has a student enrollment of 990. History Nova opened its doors in 2003 as a K–6 school. Over the years, it has grown from K–6 to K–8 to a K–12 school, graduating its first class of seniors in 2013. When it first opened, the school was based in St. Paul's Highland Park neighborhood, with K-6 students housed in a church building. When the 7th and 8th grades were added, grades 6–8 were moved to an adjoining modular building. In 2010 the school began renting space from a different church for students in grades 6-8, called the Upper Campus. The rented building was at 426 Osceola Ave S. In 2012 all grades moved to a permanent location in Victoria Park, near the Mississippi River.

Joe Perham (October 26, 1932 â€“ August 29, 2013) was an American humorist, known for his "Down East Maine" humor. Perham's humor style was an influence on Tim Sample. Sample has described Perham as a "seriously funny guy with a professionally honed native wit, which inevitably leaves his audiences weak from laughter." Early life Joe was born in West Paris, Maine, and is one of thirteen children in the Perham family. When Perham was eight, his family moved to a 200-acre farm overlooking West Paris. Perham attended Colby College in Waterville, Maine majoring in English and education.  After receiving his BA from Colby, he attained advanced degrees at the University of Maine at Orono.  While at Colby, Perham was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, and earned money by working in the feldspar mines for three summers and running a jackhammer the fourth summer for a construction firm, earning 68 cents an hour in the mine and $2.00 an hour running a pneumatic drill. Perham later became a high school English teacher and also taught speech and drama. At age 50, Perham retired from teaching to begin his career as a storyteller and humorist.

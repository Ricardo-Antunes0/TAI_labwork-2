Oddpost was a pay-for webmail service, in operation from 1999 to 2009.  Oddpost was a webmail service which allowed users to send and receive email using odd characters in their addresses. The service was operated by Oddpost AB, which was acquired by Yahoo! in July 2009. At the time of its acquisition, Oddpost had around 2 million users.  Oddpost was notable for its use of Unicode characters in user addresses. As of 2009, Yahoo! no longer supported Unicode characters in email addresses, and Oddpost ceased operations the following year.

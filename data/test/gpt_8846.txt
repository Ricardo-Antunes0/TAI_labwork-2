The Ohio Softball Field (the "OSF") is an outdoor sporting facility located in Columbus, Ohio. It is the home field of the Ohio State Buckeyes softball team. The OSF is a six-field, complex facility that includes an infield, outfield, and two covered batting cages.  Opened in 1984, the Ohio Softball Field was originally built as a three-field facility. The infield was moved to its current location in 1991, and the outfield was added in 1994. The two covered batting cages were added in 2002. In 2007, the OSF underwent a $3 million renovation that included the construction of a new grandstand and press box. In 2013, the OSF underwent another $2 million renovation that included the addition of a turf playing surface and new lighting.  The Ohio State Buckeyes softball team has played at the Ohio Softball Field since 1984. The Buckeyes have won eight national championships (1988, 1989, 1990, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, and 2013), six Women's College World Series (1987, 1988, 1990, 1995, 1997 and 2011), and four NCAA Women's Division I softball championships (1996, 1997, 1998 and 2007).

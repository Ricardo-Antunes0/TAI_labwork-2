Magdelaine La Framboise (1780â€“1846), born Marguerite-Magdelaine Marcot, was a French writer, actress, and feminist.  Laframboise was born in 1780 to a prosperous bourgeois family in Lyon. She married the wealthy lawyer Jacques-Pierre Laframboise in 1801 and soon embarked on a literary career, publishing her first play in 1805. In 1811 she became the first woman to be appointed as a judge of a court of appeal. Laframboise also became involved with the burgeoning feminist movement, campaigning for women's rights and writing essays and plays on the subject. She died in 1846.

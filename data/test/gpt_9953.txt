Qafzeh cave  means “precipice”, also known as the Cave of the Winds, because of the strong winds that blow through it. It is located in the Qafzeh Mountains, about 10 kilometers northeast of Haifa in the Israeli Jezreel Valley.    The cave is about 30 meters deep and about 110 meters wide. It was formed over a period of 600,000 years by the slow erosion of the soft limestone by rain and streams. The cave contains a number of stalactites and stalagmites, as well as a large chamber known as the Chamber of the Winds.

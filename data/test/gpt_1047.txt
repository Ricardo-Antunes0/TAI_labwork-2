The Battle of Bukoba was the first battle of the Second World War in East Africa. It took place on 6 October 1935, between Italian forces commanded by General Rodolfo Graziani and the British Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Harold Alexander. The battle ended in a British victory, with over 10,000 Italian casualties and the capture of 10,000 prisoners.  The Battle of Bukoba was fought on the plains of the Rift Valley near the town of Bukoba in present-day Tanzania. It was the first battle of the Second World War in East Africa and marked the beginning of Italyâ€™s ill-fated attempt to conquer that continent.  In 1935, Italy had acquired control of Libya and Eritrea from Britain as part of the Treaty of London. In September 1935, Italy announced its intention to annex Ethiopia, which was then a British protectorate. Britain responded by sending a military force to Ethiopia to prevent this from happening.  The British forces, consisting of an infantry division and a cavalry squadron, arrived in Ethiopia in October 1935. They were opposed by an Italian force of about 5,000 men, including 2,000 colonial troops from Libya and Eritrea. The Italians began their attack on Ethiopia on 6 October 1935.  The British forces were initially successful but were soon pushed back towards the town of Bukoba. There they met strong resistance from the Italians, who had dug in around the town. The Battle of Bukoba lasted for three days and resulted in heavy casualties on both sides

Lactarius sanguifluus, commonly known as the bloody milk cap or the blood-streaked milk cap, is a saprobic fungus with a worldwide distribution. It grows on the ground in forests, meadows, and other grassy areas. It is found in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is also found in Australia.  The fruit bodies of lactarius sanguifluus are small (2-10 cm wide), convex to flattened, with a sticky surface that is rusty brown when wet. The cap is initially brown, but later fades to a deep red or almost black color. The gills are free from the stem, and are cream to yellow in color. They are adnate at first and later become distant from one another. The spores are elliptical, 6-10 by 4-6 Âµm.  The bloody milk cap is saprobic, meaning it derives its nutrients from decomposing organic material. Its principal food sources are wood chips, bark, and dried grasses. It can also consume fungal spores and other small organisms.

WGAC-FM is a radio station located in Augusta, Georgia. The station is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to the town of Harlem and broadcast on 95.1 FM with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 5.7Â kW. It simulcasts a news/talk format with WGAC 580.  Its studios are located just two blocks from the Augusta-Richmond County border in unincorporated Columbia County, Georgia and the transmitter is in Grovetown, Georgia at the interchange of Interstate 20 and GA 388. History WGAC-FM signed on in November 1992 as an alternative rock outlet named "Channel Z 95.1", giving the area its first station playing that type of music. Although the station had a small but loyal audience, it was handicapped with a signal that covered 2/3 of the Augusta/Aiken market. It was nominated in 1996 for "Small Market Station Of The Year" as well as then-Music Director Johnny Cage for "Music Director Of The Year" by Billboard Radio Monitor and was voted "Best Radio Station" in 1995 and 1996 by readers of "Augusta Magazine".

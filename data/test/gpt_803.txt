The West Virginia Wild were a proposed professional baseball team that were to play in the new West Virginia Stadium. The team was to be owned by Jay Cullen, the owner of the Charleston RiverDogs, and was to play its home games in Beckley.  The team was announced on November 3, 2009, and was set to play its inaugural season in 2010. However, the team never materialized, and no games were ever played.

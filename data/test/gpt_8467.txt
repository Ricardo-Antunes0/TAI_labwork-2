Fredrick DuBois Bowman is an American statistician who has made significant contributions to the field of probability and its applications. Bowman is most known for his work in the theory of random processes, particularly the study of Brownian motion and its diffusion. He has also made significant contributions to the theory of probability distributions and their applications to problems in statistics, engineering, and biology.  Born in Chicago, Illinois in 1925, Bowman received his bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1947. He then completed his graduate studies at Columbia University, where he received his doctorate in 1951. After spending two years as a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University, Bowman joined the faculty at Princeton University in 1955. He retired from Princeton University in 2003, but continues to conduct research at the university.  Fredrick DuBois Bowman has been awarded a number of prestigious awards throughout his career, including the National Medal of Science (1978), the Fulkerson Prize (1981), and the John von Neumann Medal (2002). In addition, he has been awarded honorary degrees from several universities, including Harvard (1983), Yale (1986), and Columbia (1990).

Julio Llorente y Aballe (Argao, May 22, 1908 – Madrid, July 9, 1985) was a Spanish writer, journalist and politician. He was a member of the Spanish Parliament from 1951 to 1954 and from 1956 to 1959.  Llorente was born in Argao, Province of Cádiz, Andalusia. He studied law at the University of Seville and began his career as a lawyer in his home town. Llorente began writing for Catalan newspapers in the 1930s and wrote his first novel, La Sangre de Julio (1938), which won the prestigious Premio Nadal. He also wrote for magazines such as El Mundo and Temas.   In 1949 Llorente was elected to Spain's Parliament as representative for Barcelona province. He served until 1954, when he resigned to become Minister of Information in the government of José Antonio Primo de Rivera. He left the government after a few months in office when it was revealed that he had not been truthful about his military service during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco.   Llorente continued to write novels and articles, but his most famous work is probably his autobiography, Julio (1963). He died in Madrid at the age of 77.

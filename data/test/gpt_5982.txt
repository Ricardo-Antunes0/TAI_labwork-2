The Māori All Blacks, previously called the New Zealand Māori rugby team, are a New Zealand rugby union team that represents the Māori people.  The Māori All Blacks were formed in 1987, following the merger of the New Zealand Māori rugby team and the Waikato Rugby Union team. The team has played in every Rugby World Cup since its inception in 1987, reaching the quarter-finals in 1995 and the semi-finals in 2011. They also reached the final of the Churchill Cup in 2007, which they lost to England. As of February 2017, they are ranked seventh in the world by World Rugby.   The Māori All Blacks have a long and successful history in both domestic and international rugby. They are one of only two teams (the other being Argentina) to have won both the Rugby World Cup and the Rugby Championship. They also hold a record for consecutive test match victories, winning their eleventh test match against England on 24 March 2017.

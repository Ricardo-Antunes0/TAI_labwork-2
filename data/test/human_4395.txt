Miami Fashion Week (MIAFW) is an annual fashion week held in Miami, Florida, United States. Miami Fashion Week, not to be confused with the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Miami or Miami Swim Week, takes place every year during the spring and is held in the Wynwood Arts District. Miami Fashion Week was started in 1998 and is the world's largest fashion week for Latin American and the Caribbean fashion designers. Today, Miami Fashion Week is in collaboration with Miami Fashion Institute at Miami Dade College. The influence of Miami Fashion Week reaches beyond their resort wear specialty. As the longest-running fashion week in the region, Miami Fashion Week turns out a staggering number of designs in the evening wear, menswear, and intimate wear departments, while still focusing on resort wear style due to the city's close proximity to the ocean and being a travel destination to many international visitors. The event also takes on legal issues such as eco-fashion, sustainability, innovation, and production and brings them to the forefront of their audience's attention.

A microgrid is a decentralized group of energy resources that can be controlled together to produce an integrated system. Microgrids can be used to provide power to isolated areas or as a component of a larger energy system.  The potential for microgrids is enormous; they can provide power for critical applications, such as hospitals and transportation, in emergencies, and during natural disasters. They can also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by providing cleaner energy sources.  Microgrids are becoming more common as they are seen as an emerging technology with many potential benefits. There are many types of microgrids, but all share some common features: they are distributed, modular, and self-sufficient.

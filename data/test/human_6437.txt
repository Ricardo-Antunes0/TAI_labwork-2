is a Japanese paper-cutting artist and illustrator born on December 27, 1970 in Yokohama, Japan. She has been creating super fine lacy-paper-cuttings since 2000. She currently lives and works in Ferney-Voltaire, France. Art style  Hina Aoyama not only combines the art culture of Sweden and Japan, but also originated her special paper-silhouette like style of paper cutting. All her art is done by a simple pair of scissors, yet creating a fine and meticulous cutoff. She does not follow the traditional cutting style and wants to produce a world through her super fine and lacy paper cutting techniques with just a piece of paper and scissors. Most of her work requires much time and effort as they are small and delicate. With her steady hands and patience, designing these beautiful masterpieces spans the course of hours and sometimes months. Aoyamaâ€™s art pieces usually revolves around the topic of nature; they are romantic and fairytale-like, such as her works of butterflies, trees, flowers, and lots more. She also designed a fine collection of letter cutouts with exquisite writings and amazing visual effects.

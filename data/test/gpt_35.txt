Black gold  is a term used to describe natural resources found in Africa, such as diamonds, oil, and other minerals.   The term is often used to describe the wealth generated from these resources, which has led to the phrase "black gold politics" being used to describe the corrupt practices and bribery involved in the extraction of these resources.   Black gold is often seen as a curse by those who live in poverty due to the high prices and corruption associated with it.

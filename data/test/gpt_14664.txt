The maximum segment size (MSS)  is the largest packet size that can be sent on a network. The MSS may be different on each network link.  The maximum segment size (MSS) is the largest packet size that can be sent on a network. Packet sizes are important for optimizing network traffic and for ensuring reliable communication.   The MSS is set by the network administrator and may differ on each link. It is important to keep the MSS small so that packets are not too large and can be handled quickly by the network interface.   A packet with a larger MSS will likely be rejected by the network because it will exceed the maximum allowable size for a packet. This could cause problems with communications, such as slowdowns or even dropped packets.

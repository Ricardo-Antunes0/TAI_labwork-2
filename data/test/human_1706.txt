Dhives Akuru or Divehi Akuru (island letters), is a script formerly used to write the Maldivian language. This script was called Dives Akuru by H. C. P. Bell who studied Maldive epigraphy when he retired from the British government service in Colombo and wrote an extensive monograph on the archaeology, history and epigraphy of the Maldive islands. History The Dhives Akuru developed from the Grantha script. The early form of this script was Dīvī Grantha, which Bell called Evēla Akuru (ancient letters) to distinguish it from the more recent variants of the same script. The ancient form (Evẽla) can be seen in the loamaafaanu (copper plates) of the 12th and 13th centuries and in inscriptions on coral stone (hirigaa) dating back to the Maldive Buddhist period. Like Sinhala script and most of the native scripts of India (but not Thaana), Dhives Akuru descended ultimately from the Brahmi script and thus was written from left to right.

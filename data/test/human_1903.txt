The Ansaldo A.1, nicknamed "Balilla" after the Genoan folk-hero, was Italy's only domestically-designed fighter aircraft of World War I to be produced in Italy. Arriving too late to see any real action, it was however used by both Poland and the Soviet Union in the Polish-Soviet War of 1919â€“1921. Development The A.1 resulted from ongoing efforts by the Ansaldo company to create a modern fighter. The SVA.5 had proved unsuitable in this role, although it made an excellent reconnaissance aircraft and had been ordered into production as such. Ansaldo engineer Giuseppe Brezzi revised the SVA.5, reducing the size of the upper wing, and replacing the SVA's transverse Warren truss interplane struts, which had eliminated the need for spanwise-exposed flying and landing wires, with conventional wire braced struts. While this produced more drag, it increased the stiffness of the wing structure, improving manoeuvrability. Engine power was increased to  and a safety system to jettison the fuel tank through a ventral hatch (in case of onboard fire) was installed.

Eucalyptus quadricostata, commonly known as the square-fruited eucalypt, is a tree in the Myrtaceae family found in eastern Australia.  The square-fruited eucalypt is a medium-sized tree or large shrub of up to 2.5 m height and diameter, with rough, grey bark. It has smooth, greyish-green leaves, arranged alternately along the branches. The flowers are white, star-shaped and about 2 cm across. The fruit is a globular capsule about 5 mm across.  The square-fruited eucalypt is found in open forest or woodlands on coastal dunes and gravel plains from the Gascoyne region of Western Australia south to Victoria, and east to the Atherton Tableland in Queensland.

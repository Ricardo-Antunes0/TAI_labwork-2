The Irish Family (later The Irish Family Press) was an Irish weekly Roman Catholic newspaper from 1992 to 2008, providing news and commentary about the Roman Catholic Church and social issues. It was traditional Catholic in outlook, supporting the Tridentine Mass and critical of the European Union. It was founded as The Democrat in 1992 after the X Case. Shortly thereafter it changed its title to The Irish Democrat, which was later changed to The Irish Family to avoid confusion with the paper of the same name run by the Connolly Association. In its first years it was run by Dick Hogan, a Mullingar-based local newspaper proprietor and Catholic activist. It published a regular column on Marian devotion by the theologian Fr Michael O'Carroll.  It was strongly hostile to European integration and supported attempts to establish an independent Catholic political party. Other contributors included Donna-Marie Cooper Oâ€™Boyle and Ann-Marie Madden.

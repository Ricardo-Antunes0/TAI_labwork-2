Hurriganes was a Finnish rock band that was formed in the early 1970s.  They were very popular in Finland, Sweden and Estonia in the 1970s and early 1980s, as well as a popular live act in Sweden during this time.  Their classic line-up consisted of Remu Aaltonen, Albert J채rvinen, and Cisse H채kkinen.  The misspelling of the name ("Hurriganes" with a "g") is intentional.  Their style of music is very much of a nostalgic, pre-Beatles, roots rock'n'roll orientation.  During their "classic" period, the band's output consisted largely of revved-up cover versions of well-known 1950s rock 'n' roll songs, in addition to their own original material.  In this sense, Hurriganes can be viewed as Finland's answer to British pub rock performers of the 1970s like Dave Edmunds and Dr. Feelgood. The founding members were drummer and vocalist Henry "Remu" Aaltonen, bassist Hugo Christer "Cisse" H채kkinen and guitarist Ilkka "Ile" Kallio. Kallio temporarily quit the band in the spring of 1972, being replaced by guitarist Pekka "Albert" J채rvinen who was part of the band's most famous line-up.

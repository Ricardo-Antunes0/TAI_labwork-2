Troponin, or the troponin complex, is a heterogeneous protein composed of several smaller proteins. Troponin can be found in the cell nucleus and is involved in the regulation of cellular calcium homeostasis. Troponin I and troponin T are the proteins that make up the troponin complex.  The troponin complex is a heterogeneous protein composed of several smaller proteins. Troponin can be found in the cell nucleus and is involved in the regulation of cellular calcium homeostasis. Troponin I and troponin T are the proteins that make up the troponin complex. The troponin complex binds to calmodulin, which then activates the CaM-kinase II enzyme. This enzyme then phosphorylates various substrates, including tyrosine residues on the troponin proteins, leading to their degradation.

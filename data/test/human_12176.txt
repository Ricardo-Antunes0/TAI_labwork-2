Ta'anit or Taanis  is a volume (or "tractate") of the Mishnah, Tosefta, and both Talmuds. In Judaism these are the basic works of rabbinic literature. The tractate of Ta'anit is devoted chiefly to the fast-days, their practices and prayers. In most editions of the Talmud this treatise is the ninth in the mishnaic order of Seder Mo'ed, and is divided into four chapters containing thirty-four folio in all. The following is a summary of its contents: Summary of the Mishnah and Babylonian Talmud Chapter 1: Concerning the date on which one begin to mention rain in the second blessing of Shemoneh Esreh and to pray for rain in the eighth blessing (1:1-3); the time during which one fasts on account of scarcity of rain—two successive periods of three days each, and a final one of seven days—and the distinctions between these various days with regard to strictness in fasting (1:4-6); nature of the national mourning in case no rain falls despite many fast-days (1:7).

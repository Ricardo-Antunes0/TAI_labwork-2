Murray Taylorsville MAX is a planned MAX (bus rapid transit [BRT]) line anticipated to run between Murray and Taylorsville, Utah, United States that will be operated by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA). It will connect  the Murray City Center and the main campus of Salt Lake Community College (SLCC) in Taylorsville with both the TRAX light rail system and the FrontRunner commuter rail. It is the fourth of several BRT lines that UTA is planning in Utah County and the Salt Lake Valley. MAX is described by UTA as "light rail on rubber tires". Description The Murray Taylorsville MAX will connect the planned Murray City Center District with the Salt Lake Community College Taylorsville Redwood Campus, connecting with the Murray Central TRAX and FrontRunner station, the Sorensen Research Park, and the Intermountain Medical Center along the way. About a third of the route will be along West 4500/4700 South (Taylorsville Expressway/SR 266) with the other two-thirds running along various city streets. The  section along West 4500/4700 South will have dedicated lanes (between South Atherton Drive and South Redwood Road [South 1700 West/SR 68]), while rest of the line will share lanes with other traffic. There are eight planned stops for the line with plans for an additional stop to be added later as well as for the stop in Murray City Center to be replaced by another stop nearby. The cost of the BRT line is projected to be $33 million, all of which is anticipated to be locally funded. It is anticipated to cut the current bus travel time (for the length of the route) in half (from 26 minutes to 13 minutes). Planned headway will be every 15 minutes. It is anticipated to begin initial service by late 2016.

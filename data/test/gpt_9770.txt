A majoritarian electoral system is an electoral system in which a majority of the votes cast determine the outcome of an election. This is in contrast to a proportional electoral system, in which each vote has equal weight.  Majoritarian systems are most common in democracies, where they are used to elect representatives to legislative bodies. They are also used in direct elections for heads of state and government. Minorities may be under-represented in majoritarian systems, due to the fact that they may not have enough votes to win.

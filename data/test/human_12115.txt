Wooden's Legacy is a public artwork by American artist Jeffrey Rouse that is located on the west corner of Georgia and Meridian Streets, in Indianapolis, Indiana. The bronze sculpture, which was unveiled on March 9, 2012, depicts Indiana-born college basketball coach John Wooden in a crouching position in the act of coaching. He is surrounded by five basketball players represented as sets of legs, each in a style that depicts an era from Wooden's career. On and around the base are words and quotes that define Wooden's coaching philosophy, including his "Pyramid of Success." Description The sculpture depicts coach John Wooden crouching on an over sized basketball, holding a rolled up set of papers in his left hand and gesturing with his right hand. His mouth is open as he faces east towards Gainbridge Fieldhouse, the city's largest basketball arena. Wooden was born in Hall, Indiana, played basketball at Purdue University, and then later took his first college coaching position at Indiana State Teachers College, which is now called Indiana State University.

Sebastian Bakare (born 1940) is a Zimbabwean retired Anglican Bishop of the Diocese of Harare and former Bishop of Manicaland.  He was once in a power struggle over the leadership of the Diocese of Harare with Nolbert Kunonga, the former Bishop of Harare, since Kunonga was stripped of his episcopacy in January 2008 by the Province. Life Bakere was formerly Bishop of Manicaland until his retirement. He continued to reside in Mutare, the see city of his diocese, until he was asked by the Dean of the Church of the Province of Central Africa on 7 November 2007 to take over the Diocese of Harare after the ouster of Bishop Nolbert Kunonga, who had aligned himself with the Marxist r√©gime of Robert Mugabe in an attempt to withdraw his diocese from the Province of Central Africa.  It was expected Bakare would be a caretaker bishop until a substantive leader could be elected.

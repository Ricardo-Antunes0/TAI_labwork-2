Ernst Ren√© Anselm Nyberg (born 13 February 1912, died 27 March 1990) was a Swedish neuroscientist who made contributions to the understanding of brain function.  Nyberg was born in Stockholm, Sweden, on 13 February 1912. After completing his undergraduate studies at Uppsala University, Nyberg undertook postgraduate studies at the University of Geneva, where he worked with Jean-Martin Charcot and Maurice Broca. In 1938 he became a lecturer at Uppsala University. In 1950 he was appointed professor of neurobiology at Uppsala University, where he remained until his retirement in 1978.  Nyberg's work in neurobiology focused on the understanding of brain function. His early work with Charcot and Broca helped to build the foundations for modern neuroscience, and his later work focused on the investigation of how brain function is regulated. His work has had a major impact on the field of neuroscience, and has led to the development of new techniques for investigating brain function. Nyberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1972 for his work on brain function. He died in Uppsala on 27 March 1990.

Kane/Miller Book Publishers, Inc., now Kane Miller, A Division of EDC Publishing, is a San Diego, California-based specialty children's book publisher of international titles. The company was acquired by the Educational Development Corporation in 2008. History Kane Miller was started as Kane/Miller Book Publishers in 1984 by siblings Madeline Kane and Sandy Miller as a small family business, specializing in publishing children’s books from around the world for the US audience.  Miller had previously been involved with importing movies from outside the United States of America, and when he had his first child, he realized the cultural benefits of also bringing in books. The publisher found success in 1993 with Tarō Gomi's Everyone Poops, a Japanese language import that sold over one million copies and is now their best-known title. By 2000, the company closed its Brooklyn, New York offices to be based solely in San Diego, California. Both Kane and Miller retired by 2001. Kira Lynn was named the new head of the company shortly thereafter. The company was acquired by Educational Development Corporation of Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 2008, at which time the line was expanded to include new works by American authors.

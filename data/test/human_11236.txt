The Battle of Beverwijk  (Dutch: "Slag bij Beverwijk") was a violent confrontation between two hooligan supporter groups of Dutch Association football clubs Ajax and Feyenoord, the S.C.F. Hooligans and the F-Side. The incident took place on 23 March 1997 along the A9 motorway near Beverwijk, from which its name is derived. Prelude  The intent of the meeting between the two groups was a revanche, after the previously short and especially disappointing fight for the Ajax hooligans F-Side which had previously taken place along the A10 motorway. In the previous incident, both groups were to arrive with 50 hooligans each, ready for combat. The Feyenoord hooligans S.C.F., however, arrived with 75. The F-Side group were forced to escape, since they had actually arrived with 50 fighters as previously agreed upon between the two groups. The S.C.F. didn't hold their promise, as other occasions showed that the F-side group often did the same to other groups. On the date of the event, Ajax and Feyenoord were scheduled to play in Waalwijk and Alkmaar and the police were made aware that both supporter groups were going to clash on said date, but they did not know at which location. A platoon of police mobile units was deployed to the Beverwijkse Bazaar nonetheless, to protect the crowd from a potential hazard.

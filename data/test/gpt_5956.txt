Appeal to ridicule (also called appeal to laughter, appeal to derision, or appeal to smirk) is a rhetorical device whereby an author or speaker attempts to gain the support of the audience by ridiculing their opponents.  Appeal to ridicule is often used in order to discredit an opposing argument or position, or to weaken the credibility of an opponent. It can be used as a form of intimidation, by suggesting that the opponent's arguments are unworthy of serious consideration.  The appeal to ridicule is often used in situations where the arguer has a weaker argument and needs to rely on shock value in order to win over the audience.

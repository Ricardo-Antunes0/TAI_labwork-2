Cefoxitin is a second-generation cephamycin antibiotic developed by Eli Lilly and Company. It is marketed in the United States as Cefotaxime and in Europe as Ceftazidime. In contrast to first-generation cephalosporins, cefoxitin is bactericidal against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.  Cefoxitin is used for the treatment of a variety of infections, including pneumonia, UTI, and skin and bone infections. It is also used to prevent commensal infection in people with cystic fibrosis who are taking antibiotics for their illness. Cefoxitin is a preferred antibiotic for treating complicated urinary tract infections (cystitis) due to its greater effectiveness compared to other antibiotics currently available.

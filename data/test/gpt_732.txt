Gay teen fiction is a subgenre that typically features protagonists who are either gay or bisexual and deal with issues such as coming out, homophobia, acceptance, and bullying.  Gay teen fiction has become increasingly popular in recent years, as authors have been creating stories that focus on the experiences of young people who identify as gay or bisexual. This subgenre is particularly relevant given the increasing number of teens who are identifying as LGBTQ+ .  The popularity of gay teen fiction has led to a number of high-profile adaptations, including the critically acclaimed novel The Giver by Lois Lowry and the upcoming film adaptation directed by Jeff Nichols. Meanwhile, smaller publishers have been releasing niche titles that explore unique aspects of the gay teen experience, such as The Boys in the Boat by Daniel James Brown and The Girls by Emma Donoghue.  Whether it's exploring coming out stories or exploring the challenges faced by LGBTQ+ teens, gay teen fiction is an important genre that provides readers with a unique perspective on life.

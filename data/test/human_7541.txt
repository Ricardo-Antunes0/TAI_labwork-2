Universal measuring machines (UMM) are measurement devices used for objects in which geometric relationships are the most critical element, with dimensions specified from geometric locations (see GD&T) rather than absolute coordinates.  The very first uses for these machines was the inspection of gauges and parts produced by jig grinding.  While bearing some resemblance to a coordinate-measuring machine (CMM) its usage and accuracy envelope differs significantly.  While CMMs typically move in three dimensions and measure with a touch probe, a UMM aligns a spindle (4th axis) with a part geometry using a continuous scanning probe. Originally, universal measuring machines were created to fill a need to continuously measure geometric features in both an absolute and comparative capacity, rather than a point based coordinate measuring system.  A CMM provides a rapid method for inspecting absolute points, but geometric relationships, such as runout, parallelism, perpendicularity, etc., must be calculated rather than measured directly.  By aligning an accurate spindle with an electronic test indicator with a geometric feature of interest, rather than using non-scanning cartesian probe to estimate an alignment, a universal measuring machine fills this need.  The indicator can be accurately controlled and moved across a part, either along a linear axis or radially around the spindle, to continuously record profile and determine geometry.  This gives the universal machine a very strong advantage over non-scanning measuring methods when profiling flats, radii, contours, and holes, as the detail of the feature can be of at the resolution of the probe.  More modern CMMs do have scanning probes and thus can determine geometry similarly.

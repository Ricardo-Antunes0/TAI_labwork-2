Stockfish Film Festival is an international film festival in Reykjavík, Iceland. The festival takes place in the only art house cinema in Iceland, Bíó Paradís, late February every year and lasts for eleven days. The festival aims to create a platform in Reykjavík to encourage collaboration between domestic and international film communities. The festival was founded in 2015, as a reincarnation of the Reykjavík Film Festival (Icelandic: Kvikmyndahátíð í Reykjavík), which was established in 1978. It appeals to both people in the film industry and those who are interested in the wellbeing of international filmmaking. The festival is a collaboration between all of the film professional associations in Iceland and the festival's Board of Directors includes members of the major film professional associations in Iceland. Films  The festival screens some of the most up-and-coming art-house films in the world. All the feature films are handpicked by the board members and the festival, therefore, does not accept submissions of feature films. Each year the festival screens over 30 international and Icelandic award-winning films, most of which would not be otherwise screened in Iceland.

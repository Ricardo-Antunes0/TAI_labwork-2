The Armada Service (alias Tudor Service) is a set of more than 31 gilded silver dishes, dated between 1581 and 1601, formerly owned by Sir  Christopher Harris (c. 1553â€“1625), MP, of Radford House in the parish of Plymstock in Devon, England.  Twenty-six of these dishes are now in the collection of the British Museum in London. Description The dishes are parcel gilt with reeded rims and are engraved with the arms of Sir Christopher Harris of Radford. The Sherborne Mercury newspaper of Dorset reported on 28 January 1828, that following an "inspection the Herald's office, London, the arms, which are very perfect all the pieces, were those of Sir Christopher Harris, an ancestor of the Harris family of Radford, near Plymouth, quartered with those of his wives,and who lived in the year 1600". The arms of Sydenham are also said to be present, supposedly of one of Harris's wives "Mary Sydenham", who is not however listed in authoritative biographies. Sir Francis Drake did however have a connection with the Sydenham family of Combe Sydenham in Somerset. They bear prominent and large London hallmarks on the upper rims for the years 1581, 1599, 1600 and 1601.

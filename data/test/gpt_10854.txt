Thoughts on Government, or in full Thoughts on Political Economy, is a book by Adam Smith. It was first published in 1776, and discusses the idea of laissez-faire capitalism and the role of government in economic life.  Smith's book is often seen as one of the foundations of classical economics, and has been praised for its clear explanations of market mechanisms and economic problems. However, it has also been criticised for its lack of historical context, and for its lack of discussion of moral questions.

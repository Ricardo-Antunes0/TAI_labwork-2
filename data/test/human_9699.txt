Lillian Herstein (April 2, 1886 â€“ August 9, 1983) was an American labor organizer and public school teacher based in Chicago, Illinois. She was a founder of the Farmer Labor Party and in 1932 ran for Congress on its ticket. In the 1930s, she was considered one of the most influential women in the American labor movement and was appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt to serve on the U.S. delegation to an International Labour Organization meeting in Europe. Early life and education Herstein was born in Chicago, Illinois to a Russian Jewish family that had emigrated to the  United States from Lithuania. She was the youngest of six children of Wolf Herstein, the sexton of a synagogue, and Cipe Belle Herstein, who ran the C.B. Herstein Hebrew Book Store. Her father died when she was just 12, leaving the family in financial difficulties, and she was the only one of the children to go to high school. She graduated from Northwestern University with a degree in Latin and Greek (1907) and went on to get an M.A. from the University of Chicago (1924).

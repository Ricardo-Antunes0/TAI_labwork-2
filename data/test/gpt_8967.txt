Regency architecture encompasses classical buildings built in England and Wales during the Regency period, from 1811 to 1820. The style is characterised by Palladianism and a preference for classical details over the ostentatious theatricality of Neoclassicism.  The Regency period was a time of political stability and prosperity in England and Wales, which allowed architects to explore classical principles in their design. This led to the creation of some of the most enduringly beautiful classical architecture in Britain, including the Royal Pavilion at Brighton, the Prince Regent's Palace at London, and St John's Church, Liverpool.

Tresaith (otherwise Tre-saith) is a coastal village located in the parish of Kilkeel, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. It is situated on the northern shore of the River Foyle, a few kilometres east of the town of Derry.  The village is home to a small harbour and a lighthouse. The local economy is based on fishing and agriculture. The village also has a primary school and a church.  Tresaith was founded in the early 18th century by settlers from Scotland. It was known as Treasaith at the time and had a population of around 120 people. The first recorded mention of the village was in a document dated 1693.   The village was badly damaged during the Troubles, with many homes destroyed by bombings or fire. However, since the peace process has resumed, Tresaith has seen a gradual return to normalcy.

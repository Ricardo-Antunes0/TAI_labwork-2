The Beltrami County Courthouse is a historic government building in Bemidji, Minnesota, United States.  It was erected in 1902 as the seat of government for Beltrami County.  District court functions relocated in 1974 to the newly completed Beltrami County Judicial Center immediately to the southwest, and the historic courthouse has been remodeled to house government offices.  The old courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 for its state-level significance in the themes of architecture and politics/government.  It was nominated for its status in Beltrami County as its long-serving center government and as its most prominent example of public architecture and Beaux-Arts style. Description The Beltrami County Courthouse is a three-story, red, brick-and-sandstone building in the Beaux-Arts style.  Its most striking feature is its rotunda, which occupies the center of the main hall on the first floor and extends past the second floor into the dome. A railing surmounted by a brass guardrail circles the rotunda on the second floor. On the exterior, a convex dome rises above an arcaded tower topped by a statue of blind Lady Justice with her scale.

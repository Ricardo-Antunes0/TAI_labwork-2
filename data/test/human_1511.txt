Scene It? is an interactive film series created by Screenlife Games, in which players answer trivia questions about films or pop culture. The games were first developed to be played with questions read from trivia cards or viewed on a television from an included DVD or based on clips from movies, TV shows, music videos, sports and other popular culture phenomena. Scene It? was made available as a mobile game for iPhone, iPad, on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii as well as two social network games on Facebook. History Creator Dave Long made the first prototype of Scene It? in 1992, when he placed several hit films on a VHS tape and had guests identify them as quickly as possible when they played on screen. He spent the next few years developing it into a game on DVD since VHS at the time had too many restrictions. In 2000, Dave finalized the DVD and named it 'Reel to Real', he then contacted local investors to bring his game onto shelves. After setting a brand, Scene It? was released to the public in 2002. And the hit game was turned into a series.

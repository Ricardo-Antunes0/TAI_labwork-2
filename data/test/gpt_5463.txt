Subsidiary Communications Authorization (SCA) in the United States is a type of communications authority granted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to certain telecommunications carriers. SCAs are used to provide supplemental telecommunications services to eligible rural areas.  The FCC first authorized the use of SCAs in 1984. A SCA authorizes a telecommunications carrier to provide supplemental telecommunications service in designated rural areas. The carrier must be approved by the FCC and must meet certain conditions, including having a geographically dispersed service area.  SCAs are often used by telephone companies to provide telephone service to remote areas. In some cases, SCAs are also used by cable TV providers to provide cable service to rural areas.

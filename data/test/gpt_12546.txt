The Triple Crown is a "championship" consisting of the Indianapolis 500, the Brickyard 400 and the Coca-Cola 600. The first three races were all run consecutively from 1911 to 1950, except for 1942 to 1945 due to World War II.   The Triple Crown was revived in 1996 as a part of the Indy Racing League. The IRL discontinued the Triple Crown in 2008, but it was revived again in 2017 as a part of the IndyCar Series.

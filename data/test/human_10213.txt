Robyn Njegovan (born July 6, 1994) is a Canadian curler from Winnipeg, Manitoba. She currently plays second on Team Kaitlyn Jones. Career Njegovan won the 2015 Manitoba Junior provincial championship playing third for the Beth Peterson rink with Melissa Gordon at second and Breanne Yozenko at lead. At the 2015 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, they finished in fifth place with a 6–4 record. The following season, Team Peterson began competing on the World Curling Tour and finished runner-up at the 2015 Mother Club Fall Curling Classic. As Peterson and Yozenko aged out of juniors, Njegovan and Gordon brought on Abby Ackland to skip their team at the Manitoba Junior championship with Sara Oliver at lead. Together, the new lineup won the junior provincial title and represented Manitoba at the 2016 Canadian Junior Curling Championships. At junior nationals, the Ackland rink led Manitoba to a 7–3 record through the round robin and championship pools. They then faced New Brunswick's Justine Comeau in a tiebreaker, eliminating them from contention.

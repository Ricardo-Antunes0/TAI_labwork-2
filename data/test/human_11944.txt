Digital planar holography (DPH) is a method for designing and fabricating miniature components for integrated optics. It was invented by Vladimir Yankov and first published in 2003. The essence of the DPH technology is embedding computer designed digital holograms inside a planar waveguide. Light propagates through the plane of the hologram instead of perpendicularly, allowing for a long interaction path. Benefits of a long interaction path have long been used by volume or thick holograms. Planar configuration of the hologram provider for easier access to the embedded diagram aiding in its manufacture. Light can be confined in waveguides by a refractive index gradient. Light propagates in a core layer, surrounded by a cladding layer(s), which should be selected such that the core refractive index Ncore is greater than that of cladding Nclad:   Ncore> Nclad.  Cylindrical waveguides (optical fibers) allow for one-dimensional light propagation along the axis. Planar waveguides, fabricated by sequential depositing flat layers of transparent materials with a proper refractive index gradient on a standard wafer, confine light in one direction (z axis) and permit free propagation in two others (x and y axes).

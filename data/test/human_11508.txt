13 & God is a collaboration between American indie hip hop duo Themselves and German indie rock band The Notwist. The group is signed both to Anticon and Alien Transistor. History The band's name 13 & God stems from the concept of the 12 apostles and Jesus Christ forming a group that comprises 13 mortal men as well as God. Distinguishing between Themselves and The Notwist in the context of which group is '13' and which is 'God' is thus disingenuous. In the example above, God is inherently contained within '13', creating a symbiotic relationship so strong it is unable to be severed. As 13 & God are not a Christian group, but do explore elements of philosophy, spirituality and existentialism, the name 13 & God is generally considered to be more of a reflection of those elements, as well as the concept of 'identity' itself. Alternatively, it may just be a play on words with the prematurely sexy track by Boogie Down Productions titled '13 and Good' '

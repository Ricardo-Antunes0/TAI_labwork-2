"F0" is defined as the number of equivalent minutes of steam sterilization at temperature 121.1 °C (250 °F) delivered to a container or unit of product calculated using a z-value of 10 °C. The term F-value or "FTref/z" is defined as the equivalent number of minutes to a certain reference temperature (Tref) for a certain control microorganism with an established Z-value. Z-value is a term used in microbial thermal death time calculations.  It is the number of degrees the temperature has to be increased to achieve a tenfold (i.e. 1 log10) reduction in the D-value.  The D-value of an organism is the time required in a given medium, at a given temperature, for a ten-fold reduction in the number of organisms.  It is useful when examining the effectiveness of thermal inactivations under different conditions, for example in food cooking and preservation.  The z-value is a measure of the change of the D-value with varying temperature, and is a simplified version of an Arrhenius equation and it is equivalent to z=2.303 RT Tref/E.

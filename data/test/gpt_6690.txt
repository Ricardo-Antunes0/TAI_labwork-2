In political science, legitimacy is the right of a political authority to govern according to the principles of its constitution. Legitimacy is usually considered to be a component of the doctrine of the rule of law, and is also closely related to the principle of subsidiarity.  The concept of legitimacy has been discussed in detail by political philosophers, and there is no single, definitive understanding of it. In general, legitimacy refers to the belief that a particular authority or institution has the right to govern in a particular way, and that its actions are justified by their adherence to law or some other criterion of legitimacy.  Legitimacy may be conferred upon an authority either by its own members or by the general public. It is also possible for an authority to be legitimate without being recognized by all members of society. For example, a military government that is supported by the population may be considered to be legitimate, even if it is not formally recognized by the country's government.   The concept of legitimacy also has implications for the behavior of authorities and for the way in which they are treated by their citizens. For example, authorities that are considered to be illegitimate may be subject to greater public scrutiny and protest than authorities that are considered to be legitimate.

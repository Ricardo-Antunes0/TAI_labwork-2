For the next seven seasons, Walz was a fringe NHLer, playing a good chunk of his time in the American Hockey League (AHL). He averaged better than a point per game in the AHL, and was named MVP of the 1996 AHL All-Star Game, but it never got him a full-time NHL job.

He did manage to score a career-high 38 points in 53 games for the Calgary Flames in 1993â€“94, but in 1996, he left North American hockey for the Swiss league.

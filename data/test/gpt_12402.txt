In thermodynamics, the Gibbs free energy (or free enthalpy) of a system is a measure of the energy available to do work on the system. The free energy is defined as the sum of the internal energies of the constituent particles of the system.  The Gibbs free energy can be thought of as a measure of how much work is available to do on the system. This work can be done by moving or rearranging the particles in the system, and is often called "internal" or "kinetic" work.  The Gibbs free energy is always positive, and depends only on the interactions between the particles in the system. In many cases, the free energy can be used to calculate other thermodynamic properties of the system, such as equilibrium constants and entropy.

UBI Theatre Leipzig was a bilingual (English and German) theatre company based in Leipzig (Germany). Established in Birmingham (England) in 2002, it moved to Leipzig in 2005 along with its founder Gareth Knapman. In 2012, German theatre educator and actress Claudia Jessat joined the company and the two of them managed the company together until Knapman's passing in early 2016, after which Jessat assumed the role of the owner. The name of the company was then changed from Ubiquity Theatre Company to UBI Theatre Leipzig. UBI seeks to produce socially conscious theatre projects in both performance and in workshop projects with children, youngsters and adults. UBI follows the British tradition of 'Theatre in Education' and 'Community Theatre', and is influenced by Bertolt Brecht, Keith Johnstone and Augusto Boal in its ideals of using theatre for social gain. Projects used to take place in their Leipzig premises and various local theatres. Previous productions

David "Elsewhere" Bernal (born August 2, 1979) is an illusionary dancer from Santa Ana, California. His mother is Peruvian, and his father from New Mexico. He became known through a viral video clip —often titled Kolla2001— of his participation in the 2001 edition of the Korean American talent show Kollaboration, dancing to the Kraftwerk song Expo 2000. He has been involved as a dancer in a number of projects since, including videos, adverts, and the Tim Burton film Alice in Wonderland. He has also worked with artists such as Michael Jackson. Viral video Bernal first became known through a video of him battle dancing against Mike Song of the Kinjaz at Kollaboration, an Asian American talent show, in 2001 that went viral. The clip showcased Bernal's characteristic take on the contemporary dance styles of popping and abstract waving. Performances of these dances were rare at the time, and the clip became very popular when it circulated on the internet — so popular that in November 2006, The Viral Factory, a viral marketing company, collated page-impression figures from websites such as YouTube and Google Videos. They determined that, as of November 2006, this video had been viewed over 200 million times, making it the 8th most viewed video.

Dedovshchina (; lit. reign of grandfathers) is a term used in Russian culture to describe a form of extended family organization where the members take care of one another. It is particularly common in rural areas and among the peasantry.  Dedovshchina is also a term used to describe a form of reciprocal, paternalistic violence exercised by family patriarchs against their children, grandchildren, and other members of the extended family. This type of violence may involve physical punishment, psychological intimidation, or economic withdrawal of support.  The term is often seen as a source of shame and stigma for the perpetrators, and has been described as a form of social exploitation. Dedovshchina has been cited as a major contributor to Russia's high levels of domestic violence.

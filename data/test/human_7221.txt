"Bin Sangyeo Nori" refers to performances by the lead vocalist of the funeral songs called "Apsorikkun" and a group of pallbearers or "Sangdukkun". "Apsorikkun" sings the first part of the song while others sing the chorus. At the night before, it happens in order to familiarize themselves with carrying the coffin properly during the morning ceremony. The name originates from three words: "빈" meaning "empty", "상여" meaning "bier" and "놀이" meaning "entertainment. The Process  Once the coffin room is prepared and "Seongbokje" or a rite performed prior to the funeral is completed, the host family arranges a table of various types of food for the deceased person during the morning as well as night while welcoming the mourners. The funeral might continue for two or three or seven days, the most common length being three days. The day before the actual burial is referred to as "Deuneun Nal" when the mourners console the chief mourner or "Sangju", burn incense and bow twice before the deceased- a ritual called "Bunhyangjaebae". "Bin Sangyeo Nori" is particularly significant for the "Hosang"- the funeral rites for the wealthy or elderly people who died a peaceful death. The night before the burial, during an event referred to as "Daedotum", Sangdukkuns perform the "빈 상여놀이" by carrying the empty casket and singing "Sangyeotsori". It is generally performed by the young adult males from the particular village and each of them is included in this carrying out process either in the mourning-house yard or the street in front of that house.

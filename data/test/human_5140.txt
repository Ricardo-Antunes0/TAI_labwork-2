York Carmelite Friary was a friary in York, North Yorkshire, England, that was established in about 1250, moved to its permanent site in 1295 and was surrendered in 1538. The original site was on Bootham in York until 1295 when William de Vescy gave the Carmelite friars a tenement in Stonebow Lane which extended as far south as the River Foss and from east to west between the streets of Fossgate and 'Mersk'. Within five years the friary church was under construction followed by the consecration of a cemetery in 1304 and the church in 1328. A royal licence was granted in 1314 that allowed the friars to build a quay on the Fishpond of the Foss and keep a boat that enabled the transporting of building materials. This licence and the gift of additional lands was followed by a number of extensions that took place throughout the 14th century culminating in the rebuilding of the church in 1392 as the friary eventually extended as far east as Hungate. The location of friary land within the parishes of St Crux and St Saviour meant that from 1301 an annual payment to St Saviour's was established following complaints from St Mary's convent to whom the church was appropriated. In 1320 Archbishop Melton stated that annual compensation was to be paid to the rector of St Crux and in 1350 the friary was restricted in the use of its chapel. The chapel, which was located above the gatehouse at the northern end of the friary, contained a life-size statue of the Virgin Mary which attracted many pilgrims, but the friars were made to remove the statue.

The Network Access License (NAL) is mandatory for the use of IP addresses within a private network. It is also used by ISPs to charge for the use of their assigned IP addresses.   The Network Access License was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in 1994. It is a license agreement that allows for the allocation of specific IP addresses to networks. It also allows for the charging of fees for the use of these IP addresses.

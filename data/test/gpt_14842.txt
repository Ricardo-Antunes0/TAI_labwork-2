All Hung Up is a 1968 album by American singer Stevie Wonder.  The album was recorded during the final months of Wonder's contract with Motown Records, and features the hits "I Just Called to Say I Love You" and "Superstition". Released two weeks after Wonder's landmark album Innervisions, All Hung Up was less successful commercially, but has been more frequently cited by critics and fans as one of Wonder's finest recordings.  Wonder began recording All Hung Up in late 1967, shortly before his contract with Motown expired. The album was produced by Wonder, Al Jackson Jr., and Frank Wilson and featured the funk-based tracks "I Just Called to Say I Love You" and "Superstition". Both songs became massive hits for Wonder, reaching number one on the charts in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The album also features the ballad "All I Want for Christmas Is You", which was written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil.   Despite being less successful commercially than Innervisions, All Hung Up has been more frequently cited by critics and fans as one of Wonder's finest recordings. The album has been reissued several times, most recently in 2009 as part of The Motown Albums Collection, a box set that also includes Wonder's studio recordings for Motown from 1959 to 1982.

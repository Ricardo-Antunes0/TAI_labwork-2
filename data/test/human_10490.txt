The school also has pupils attending from other nearby areas of Dunbartonshire and Stirlingshire. History Balfron High School grew out of the Parish Church of Balfron, which can be traced back to the 17th century. The school became a High School in 1925 with the original school building in Balfron dating back to the early part of the 20th century. A major extension was built in the 1960s. The old school was known for being too small, due to the use of many mobile classrooms that were originally only meant as a temporary measure. In fact the mobile classrooms stood for many years and remained until the school was demolished. The original façade was preserved and has now been created into two homes, with the rest of the site of the old school also being developed into new homes.

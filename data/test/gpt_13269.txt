Gungahlin Drive is an arterial road in the Australian capital city of Canberra. The road runs from the Royal Military College (RMC) on the southern edge of the city to the Australian Federal Police Headquarters on the northern edge. The road is designated as part of State Route 3.  Gungahlin Drive was first proposed in 1929 as an alternate route to avoid the congested route through Town Hall. Construction began in 1934 and was completed in 1936. The road originally ran between RMC and Lake Burley Griffin, but was extended to its current length in 1959. The section between RMC and Greenway was upgraded to a dual carriageway in 1997, and a section between Greenway and Tuggeranong was upgraded to a freeway in 2002.

Victor Alexis Rivera Santiago (September 17, 1986 – July 1, 2010), better known by his stage name Lele “El Arma Secreta”, was a Puerto Rican rapper, singer, and songwriter signed to the Rottweilas label. He recorded solo or as part of a duo with partner Endo under Endo & Lele las Armas Secretas. He was also known by his nickname "El Arma Secreta". After discovering his musical talent, Lele worked in Héctor el Father's Gold Star Music label as a songwriter from 2003 until 2008. He wrote songs for artists such as Yomo, Héctor el Father and Daddy Yankee. After the company dissolved, he recorded "O Me Pagas" (ft Endo), a diss track towards Héctor el Father. He went on to sue him for the royalties of over 40 songs he had written for him but lost the case. He later went on to work with Cosculluela in his newly funded label Rottweilas Inc., where he both wrote and recorded songs, most of them along with his partner Endo, and he went on to start recording an album as a rapper, while both writing and performing the tracks.

Horsepower (hp) is a unit of measurement for power. One horsepower is equivalent to 746 watts (7.46 kilowatts), and is the standard unit of measurement in the automotive industry.  Horsepower is the principal measure of power in motorsport and the engineering field. In the late 19th century, horsepower was the most common unit of power measurement in the United States. In 1901, an international conference on standardization of power measurements resulted in the adoption of the metric horsepower as the global standard. The definition of horsepower is not precisely defined but it is generally accepted to be equal to 1,000 watts (1 megawatt).

Iran and Turkmenistan share a common border which has been a source of tension and conflict in the past. The two countries have had a complicated history, with Iran and Turkmenistan both having a significant Turkic population. Turkmens make up the majority of the population in Iran, while Iranian Arabs make up the majority of the Turkmen population in Turkmenistan. Despite this history of tension, the two countries have had a number of cooperative projects in recent years, including joint military exercises and a trade agreement.

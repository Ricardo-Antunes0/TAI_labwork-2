The Terrible class was a group of ironclad warships built for the British Royal Navy in the mid-1860s. The class was unusual in that it consisted of two different designs, the first being a broadside ironclad and the second being a turret ship. The class was not a success and only four ships were completed.  The Terrible class was a group of ironclad warships built for the British Royal Navy in the mid-1860s. The class was unusual in that it consisted of two different designs, the first being a broadside ironclad and the second being a turret ship. The class was not a success and only four ships were completed.  The first ship, HMS Terrible, was an experimental design that was not successful and was quickly scrapped. The other three ships, HMS Terror, HMS Temeraire, and HMS Triumph, were all built as broadside ironclads but they were all modified to become turret ships later on. However, even with the modifications, all four ships were considered to be very Poorly designed vessels and they all suffered from various mechanical problems.  The main problems with the Terrible class were their engines which were very unreliable and their armour which was very weak compared to other contemporary warships. Additionally, the ships had very low speed which made them very vulnerable to enemy fire. All four ships were also lost during their careers which ultimately led to their ultimate demise.

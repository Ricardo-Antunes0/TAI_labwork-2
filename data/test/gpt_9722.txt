John Egerton Christmas Piper CH (13 December 1934 â€“ 16 December 2002) was an Australian artist. He was born in Melbourne and died in Sydney.  Piper exhibited widely, his work being held in major collections including the National Gallery of Victoria and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. He was a regular participant in group exhibitions and had his first solo exhibition in 1959.  Piper's paintings are characterised by their lyrical use of light and colour, their often simple composition and the sense of movement they convey. He often used Australian landscapes as inspiration, depicting them with a realism that is both natural and atmospheric.

Andrew Glaze (April 21, 1920 â€“ February 7, 2016) was an American poet, playwright and novelist. Much of Glaze's poetry reflects his coming of age in the American South, and his eventual return there. He also lived and wrote in New York City for 31 years. In New York City he became part of a circle of poets that included Oscar Williams, Norman Rosten, John Ciardi and William Packard. Personal history Andrew Louis Glaze was born in Nashville, Tennessee, to Mildred Ezell Glaze and Dr. Andrew Louis Glaze M.D., a dermatologist. He grew up in Birmingham, Alabama with a younger sister and brother, and attended Ramsay High School. He has been called both Andrew L. Glaze III, and Junior. His grandfather, Andrew Lewis Glaze, was a Confederate doctor during the Civil War. After graduating from the Webb School in Bell Buckle, Tennessee, Glaze went on to major in English at Harvard College. Immediately after graduating from Harvard in 1942, Glaze enlisted in the United States Air Force to serve during World War II. He sailed to Europe on the RMS Queen Mary, which had been converted into a troop transport ship that could carry 15,000 men. "The American poet Andrew Glaze, then an Air Force lieutenant, stood on the foredeck and looked down on 'a quarter of a mile of human circles shooting craps'." When the war was over, while waiting his turn to be shipped back home, he attended the University of Grenoble. He died on February 7, 2016 in Birmingham, Alabama.

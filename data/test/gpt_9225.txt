Detective Michael Tritter is a recurring fictional character on the television series "Law & Order", played by actor Richard Belzer.  Michael Tritter is a New York City police detective and partner of Det. Robert Goren. He is often at odds with his superiors, as well as with his fellow detectives. He is also known for his no-nonsense attitude and propensity for taking risks.  Belzer was initially offered the role of Michael Tritter, but turned it down because he felt that the character was too "over the top". The producers were then forced to recast the role, and they chose John Munch to play the character.

Hauptgebaude, (;  'main building') also known as the Bauhaus, was the name given to the main building of the architectural school in Weimar, Germany. It was designed by Walter Gropius and built from 1919 to 1925.  The Bauhaus school was founded in Weimar in 1919 by Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Berthold Lubetkin. Initially, the school offered a program in architecture, industrial design, and painting. However, the school's focus soon shifted to furniture design and architecture. The Hauptgebaude, or "main building", was designed by Gropius in the International Style and was completed in 1925. The building is famed for its use of steel and glass, its functionalist design, and its integration of art and architecture.

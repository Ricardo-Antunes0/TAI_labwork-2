His mother was a Professional Gymnast that had a career-ending injury from being on the U.S. Olympic gymnastics team. While his very close uncle is an action sports pioneer. Ethan states his family was "practically born backflipping dirtbikes and snowboards". Also stating “I was introduced to action sports by Gregg Godfrey, as soon as I was basically born,” Ethen says. He started racing motorcycles when he was 3 years old and eventually got into BMX racing too, but the freestyle eventually won him over in the end. “I loved racing, but I loved jumping more.”  At age 19, he left for Argentina for two years on a mission for his church, he spent those entire two years away from action sports completely. He didn't ride anything at all, just devoted himself to his mission until he was 21. He was one of the youngest kids to backflip a motorbike, doing so at the age of 14. On January 5, 2020, he and his wife Heather welcomed a boy, York, their second child.

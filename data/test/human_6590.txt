Rexin G is a tumor-targeted genetic medication for cancer. Its primary mechanism is a retrovector bearing a cytocidal cyclin G1 construct, which is a form of targeted gene therapy vector used to get a fast track orphan drug priority for multiple cancer indications within the United States. After phase one and two clinical trials, the drug has been shown to effectively shrink metastatic tumors and triple the survival times of chemotherapy-resistant pancreatic cancers. Recent studies have also confirmed the overall safety of the Rexin G drug and have shown that Rexin-G monotherapy, at the recommended dose levels, exhibits significant anti-tumor activity and increases both overall survival time and the survival rates in the majority of patients. History While the molecular cloning and the characterization of the G1 proto-oncogene began in 1994, the design and the constructs of the first target delivery system began in 1995, though it was not possible to implement int until late 1997. The initial concepts behind Rexin-G was first possible in 2002 and the first toxicology studies of the drug began in 2004. Studies into the effective of the drug soon began after the drug was found to be non-toxic in both mammals in the 2005. With the introduction of clinical grade vectors in the 2006, the drug soon saw widespread testing in late 2006.

Grace Hamblin  (1 January 1908 – 15 July 2006) was an English biochemist, who made significant contributions to understanding the molecular basis of DNA replication.  Hamblin was born in 1908 in Warrington, England to John and Emma Hamblin. She studied biochemistry at the University of Cambridge, where she received her BSc in 1932 and her MSc in 1933. She then became a postgraduate student at King's College London, where she received her PhD in 1939.  After completing her doctorate, Hamblin worked as a research scientist at the University of Cambridge for a few years before moving to the University of Glasgow in 1942. There, she helped to establish the Scottish Biochemistry Department and was its first chairperson. She remained there until 1969, when she moved back to Cambridge as a professor of biochemistry. She retired from this position in 1984.  Hamblin made significant contributions to understanding the molecular basis of DNA replication. Her work on the genetic code led to the development of molecular biology, and her work on DNA repair mechanisms has had a lasting impact on cancer research. Grace Hamblin died on 15 July 2006 at the age of 96.

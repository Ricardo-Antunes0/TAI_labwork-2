7800° Fahrenheit is the second studio album by American rock band Bon Jovi. It was released on March 27, 1985, through Mercury Records. The album's title is a reference to the supposed melting point of rock, which is equivalent to 4313° Celsius. In the United States, the Fahrenheit scale is in general use, suggesting the album consists of "American hot rock". The album's artwork introduced the classic 1980s Bon Jovi logo that would later be used on Slippery When Wet and New Jersey. 7800° Fahrenheit spent 104 weeks on the Billboard 200 albums chart and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on February 19, 1987. The singles "Only Lonely" and "In and Out of Love" both charted on the Billboard Hot 100. Background Recorded in six weeks between January and March 1985, at the Warehouse Studios in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the album marked the final collaboration between Bon Jovi and producer Lance Quinn. It is the only Bon Jovi album to feature songwriting by four of the band members; "Secret Dreams" is the only Bon Jovi song to date for which drummer Tico Torres receives a writing credit.

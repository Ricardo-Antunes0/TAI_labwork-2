Herbert Henry Uhlig (3 March 1907 â€“ 3 July 1993) was an American physical chemist who studied corrosion. Biography He received his B.S. in chemistry from Brown University in 1929 and his Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1932 from MIT under John Kirkwood and Frederick Keyes(1885 - 1976).  He worked briefly as a biochemist at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now named The Rockefeller University) and then the Lever Brothers Company before returning to MIT in 1936 as a research associate in the Corrosion Laboratory.  This was interrupted by World War II, during which time he joined the staff of the Research Laboratory at the General Electric Company in Schenectady, New York, to study metal corrosion on aircraft and other military equipment.  However, he returned to MIT in 1946 as an associate professor of metallurgy and director of the Corrosion Laboratory.  Uhlig became a full professor in 1953 and retired in 1972. Afterwards, he became a visiting professor for institutions around the world, including some in Massachusetts, Australia, and the Netherlands. He also served as president of the international Thoreau Society and of the Rumford Historical Society in Woburn, Massachusetts.

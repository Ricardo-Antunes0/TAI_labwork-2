The National Park Service underwent an intensive public engagement and outreach process to develop the Vail Agenda, a 20-year plan that identifies and addresses priorities for the Park Service's work in the Vail Valley. The Vail Agenda was developed through extensive public input, and represents the collective voices of park visitors, partners, employees, and the Park Service's advisory committees.  The Vail Agenda sets forth a vision for the Park Service's work in the Vail Valley and identifies key priorities for the next 20 years. The Vail Agenda builds on themes identified in the Park Service's 2013 Master Plan for the Vail Valley, which identified eight objectives that guide our work in the valley. The Vail Agenda also builds on other Park Service planning documents, such as the National Historic Preservation Plan for Colorado and Utah and the agency's Resource Management Plan.  The Vail Agenda includes goals to:   1. Enhance visitor experiences and understanding of Vail Valley National Park and adjacent ski resorts 2. Enhance visitor safety and well-being 3. Promote responsible recreation in a sustainable manner 4. Safeguard natural resources and cultural heritage 5. Enhance park management capacity 6. Address climate change impacts in the valley 7. Strengthen relationships with surrounding communities 8. Cooperate with other federal, state, local, and private entities

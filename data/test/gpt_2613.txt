Chinese whispers (Commonwealth English) or telephone (American English) is a form of secret communication using a two-way audio telephone. It is also known as a private conversation, a confidential conversation, or whisper conversation.  Chinese whispers usually refers to the practice of speaking in a low volume so as not to be overheard by others, especially when discussing sensitive information. When two people are whispering to each other, their voices may overlap and the messages will be incomprehensible to anyone else.

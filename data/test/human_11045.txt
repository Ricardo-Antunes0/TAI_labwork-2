Cui Rong (, 653â€“706) was a poet during the era of the Tang dynasty, which includes the short-lived dynasty of Wu Zetian. His poetry style was typical of Tang poetry. He is famous for editing an anthology of poetry of the court of Wu Zetian: a work known as the Collection of Precious Glories (Zhuying ji), which  contained poems by himself, Li Jiao (644-713), Zhang Yue (677-731), and others. The original work was long thought to be completely lost, however fragments constituting about one-fifth of the original were found among the manuscripts found at Dunhuang, with fifty-five poems by thirteen men. One notable feature of this anthology is that Cui Rong arranged the work in descending order of official rank of the included poets; which, among other things, highlights the nature of early Tang poetry as a type of court poetry.

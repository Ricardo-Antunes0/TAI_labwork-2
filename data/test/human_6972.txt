Lottie Dolls are a series of dolls created by Arklu Ltd. Launched in August 2012.  Lottie promotes STEM subjects for kids and was even the first doll in space when she travelled to the International Space Station alongside British European Space Agency Astronaut, Tim Peake, on the Principia Mission, in December 2015. History     Arklu co-founders, Ian Harkin and Lucie Follett, based in London at the time, noticed a niche in the market, with parents concerned about the over-sexualization of dolls currently available in the market. They began 18-months of research, alongside British academics, resulting in Lottie; a doll based on the proportions of an average 9-year-old girl (with the exception of her head, which is larger to allow more hairstyling play). The research was gathered by leading British academics, Professor David McCarthy (Prof of Nutrition and Health - Institute for Health Research & Policy, London Metropolitan University) and Dr Margaret Ashwell OBE (formerly Science Director of the British Nutrition Foundation).    Arklu co-founder and Managing Director Ian Harkin decided to move from London to Letterkenny in County Donegal, close to Ian's hometown of Ballybofey in 2014. Donegal is commonly acknowledged as a blackspot for unemployment, and many young people are forced to move away to pursue careers. Having secured a grant from Enterprise Ireland's High Potential Start-Up Fund, Arklu were able to move and expand their business. Lucie Follett was Arklu's Creative Director with responsibility for all brand building, product development and product partnerships.

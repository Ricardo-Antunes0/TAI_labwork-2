Eric Henry Edward Tovey (3 January 1929 â€“ 9 September 2016), known professionally as Lord Littlebrook, was a British midget wrestler. He enjoyed his greatest success during the 1970s, when he held the NWA World Midget's Championship. He was also part of the Wrestlemania III card in 1987 in front of a record 93,173 fans at the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit, then the largest professional wrestling attendance in North American history. Career Tovey was born in England  on 3 January 1929 and grew up with six siblings. He began performing in front of audiences in the circus at the age of 14 serving as an acrobatic midget clown. Tovey traveled to the United States with the circus in 1949 but lost his job when the circus went out of business. He was then convinced by a friend that he would be an ideal midget wrestler. After three months of training, Tovey made his debut as "Lord Littlebrook" against Major Tom Thumb. Although from a working-class background, Tovey took a nobility gimmick in line with the general American stereotype of the British.

Club Fuck! (also known as Club FUCK!) was a nightclub that officially began the summer of 1989 and was hosted by Miguel Beristain, Cliff Diller, and James Stone. The weekly party was located at Basgo's Disco in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles. It later moved to Dragonfly Bar in West Hollywood and lasted until 1993, when it was raided by the Los Angeles Police Department's Vice Division. Fuck! constituted a gritty liminal space oppositional to both the neighborhood's largely men-only leather bars as well as the clean-cut bars of West Hollywood. At Fuck! the modified, pierced, and tattooed body was front and center. Scarring, mummification, and piercing were staples at Fuck!, confronting fears of contagion while revealing the temporality of the body during the height of the AIDS crisis. Performances at Fuck! were both transgressive and theatrical, pushing the limits of what the performer's body (and audience) could endure with a spirit of play.

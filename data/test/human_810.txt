Commentator (foaled March 27, 2001), is an American Thoroughbred race horse by the stallion Distorted Humor, sire of 2003 Kentucky Derby winner Funny Cide.  Like Funny Cide, Commentator is a New York-bred as well as a gelding.  Distorted Humor also sired Hystericalady. Commentator's dam, Outsource, was a daughter of Storm Bird, at two a champion in both England and Ireland and a stamina-producing sire.  Storm Bird, by Northern Dancer, also sired Storm Cat and Summer Squall.  Outsource was born small and deformed so she never raced or was trained.  Instead she was bred to Distorted Humor at only two years of age, and the result was  Commentator, making Outsource one of the youngest mares ever to produce a Grade I winner.  In 2002, Outsource was purchased in foal to Chief Seattle by Kentucky Governor Brereton Jones of Airdrie Stud near Midway, Kentucky for $25,000 at the Keeneland January mixed sale. She has a yearling full sister to Commentator, and delivered another Distorted Humor filly on February 16, 2008.

Regional Training Regiments (abbreviated Rindam) are Indonesian training centers and regimental depots serving newly recruited enlisted personnel of the 15 Regional Military Commands of the Indonesian Army. These regiments are the regional command's home base for recruiting and training of personnel within their areas of responsibility. Definition  Rindams are defined as a military educational institution under the direct control of the Regional Military Command for enlisted and non-commissioned officers (other than Akmil, Seskoad, and Secapa) which have the main task of helping organize military training and education for all ranks of the RMC (Kodam) to produce soldiers who are professional, reliable, quality and have achieved basic military skills and tactical work for peace and wartime actions and are loved by the people not just of their communities but of the country at large.   Rindam has several units in charge of conducting first, vocational and qualification education (Secata, Secaba, Dodiklatpur, Dodikjur, and Dodikbelanegara). Regional Training Regiments are stationed in all 15 territorial commands of the Indonesian Army and are stationed in key Indonesian cities.

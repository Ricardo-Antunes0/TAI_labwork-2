Warsaw Water Filters, also known as Lindley's Filters (Polish – "Filtry Lindleya") is one of three Warsaw waterworks, and is located in Ochota between Koszykowa, Krzywickiego, Filtrowa and Raszyńska streets. The waterworks was finished in 1886 using William Lindley's design. Since 1973, Warsaw Filters has been on the antiquities list. Construction Warsaw Filters was founded by the Mayor of Warsaw, Russian general Sokrates Starynkiewicz (Russian – Сократ Старинкевич). After his approval in 1881, construction started. The design by William Lindley consisted of the River Pump Station and a Filter Station on the left bank of the Vistula. During the construction, all available technologies were used, with even minor details made of high-quality resources. Basic materials used while building Filters were waterproof bricks, granite and sandstone.  The first processed water was distributed to Warsaw citizens on July 3, 1886, from filters consisting of a group of slow sand filters, clean water tank, pump depot and a water tower.  The design was by William Lindley, but was supervised and modernised by his son, William Heerlein Lindley.

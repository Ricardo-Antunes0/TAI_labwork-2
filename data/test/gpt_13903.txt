Yuan Qigui (袁齊媯) (405–440), formally Empress Yuan of Liang (梁太后), was an empress of the Chinese dynasty Liang Dynasty. She was a daughter of Emperor Huai and a sister of Emperor Wu.  Yuan Qigui was born in 405, during the reign of her father Emperor Huai. As a daughter of Emperor Huai, she was considered to be a potential heir to the throne, but she did not inherit the throne herself. Instead, her older brother Emperor Wu succeeded her father to the throne in 410.  After her brother became emperor, Yuan Qigui was created an empress and given the title "Empress Yuan of Liang" (梁太后). In 416, she married the general Liu Yu (劉瑜), who later became the emperor of Southern Liang. The couple had two children—a son Liu Yong (劉永) and a daughter Princess Pingyang (平陽公主).  In 440, after Liu Yu's death, Yuan Qigui retired from court and returned to her home province of Liang Province. She died there in 441, at the age of 39.

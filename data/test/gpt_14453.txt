The Hungarian method is a combinatorial optimization algorithm for solving problems in geometry and combinatorial optimization. It was introduced by Péter Szabó in 1993. The algorithm is based on the principle of duality, which states that certain problems can be solved in a more efficient way by transforming them into equivalent problems with a different structure.  The Hungarian method is a two-phase algorithm. In the first phase, the algorithm builds a graph from the input data. This graph is used to solve the equivalent problem in the second phase. The advantage of this algorithm is that it can solve many problems in a short amount of time.

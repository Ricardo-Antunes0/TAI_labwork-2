Bile bears, sometimes called battery bears, are large bears that are found in the forests of Southeast Asia. They are the heaviest bear species in that area and can weigh up to 650 kg (1,500 lb).  Bile bears are mostly nocturnal animals and are known to be solitary creatures. They feed mainly on fruit, but will also eat meat. They are skilled climbers and are able to move through the forest canopy very quickly.

The Geißstein, sometimes also called the Gaisstein, is a type of travertine stone found in the Central German region of Franconia. It is a medium-sized, grayish-white stone with a slightly concave surface.  The Geißstein has been used for building purposes for centuries, mainly in the Franconian region. It is an important building stone due to its resistance to weathering and its appearance, which can range from creamy white to shades of gray. The stone is also relatively easy to work with, making it a popular choice for architects and builders.

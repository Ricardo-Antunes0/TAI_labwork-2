Taubenberg is a mountain with a height of 896 m amsl and area of 1847 ha in the Warngau municipality in the district of Miesbach in Bavaria, Germany. It is set apart from the Tegernsee mountains of the Bavarian Prealps. It is a popular hiking destination and the most important water supply area of the Bavarian capital Munich. About two-thirds of the mountain is owned by the city of Munich, the rest is freehold of local farmers and foresters. Geography Geologically Taubenberg belongs to the Molasse foothills with its characteristic east-west orientation and marks (as for example, the Hoher Peißenberg ) the northern edge of the Subalpine Molasse(German) in the Bavarian Alpine foothills and thus the geological edge of the Alps. Taubenberg is the result of debris flows of the upper freshwater molasses, which came from the south about 10-15 million years ago - when the Alps were formed. These coarse debris cones now form characteristic mountains in front of the exits of the former tertiary Alpine rivers ( Tischberg{German} , Hoher Peißenberg, Irschenberg and others). Through the ice of later glaciations they were later left as Buttes from their softer environment of fine sands and acted as icebreakers, separating the ice flows of individual glacier termini.

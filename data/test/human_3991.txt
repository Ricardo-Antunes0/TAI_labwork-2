Unplanned America is a gonzo television documentary series about three Australians, Pawel Jarecki, Tim 'Gonzo' Ryan and Nick Maher, who travel across America without a plan, other than to embark new adventures encountering as many unique individuals as possible. Driving an unreliable ’99 Camry with 300,000 kilometres on the odometer they hit the road to discover the real America. The trio placed their fate in the hands of the strangers they encountered along the way, in the hope of discovering a side of America that hadn’t been uncovered in backpacker travel guides. History  In 2012 Gonzo, Parv and Nick travelled to the States in the search of the most unique, challenging and inspiring societies that the "land of the free" had to offer. On a shoestring budget, funded by the three producers themselves, they travelled for six months throughout the USA, driving through more than 35 states and clocking up more than 20,000 miles. They filmed stories all over the country in places as varied as the mountains of Colorado, the Californian desert, Detroit’s urban wasteland, islands off the southern tip of Texas, the rainy city of Seattle, the mean streets of south Chicago and under the bright lights of NYC.

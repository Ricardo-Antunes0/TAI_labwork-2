Byeokgolje Ssangyong Nori is a major event of the Byeokgol Cultural Festival (38 times as of 1998) held every year in mid-October (September 9 on the lunar calendar). It is a folk game that has been handed down to Byeokgolje (a reservoir during the Baekje period) in Buryang-myeon, Gimje. It is also in honour of the spirit of Danyanangja, who became a sacrifice to protect the Byeokgolje festival in Yonggol Village, Yonggol-ri, Buryang-myeon, Gimje-si, Jeollabuk-do on September 9th of the lunar calendar. Byeokgolje Ssangyong Nori is said to have developed into a folk game of the present day by fighting the two dragons of Baengnyong and Cheongnyong and an event to comfort the soul of Danya, the daughter of Tae-soo Kim, who was sacrificed in the process. The story of the embankment construction of Byeokgolje and the dragon came to the later generations and became a game as they intertwined with the affectionate conflict of humans.

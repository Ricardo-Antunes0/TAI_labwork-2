Gnathaena  was an Athenian hetaira (plural: hetairai) in the 5th century BC. She was the lover of Aristophanes, and is mentioned in his plays The Acharnians and The Birds.  Gnathaena was said to be beautiful, with a voice like the nightingale, and a mind as sharp as a razor. She was also said to be a ruthless businesswoman, able to exploit any opportunity that came her way.  Aristophanes plays her character in both The Acharnians and The Birds as a shrewd and calculating hetaira who uses her wiles to get what she wants from her lovers. In The Acharnians, she tricks Glaucon into believing that she is interested in him, while in The Birds, she tricks the warthog Eurymachus into paying her to make love to him.

Gustav Steinbrecht (1808–1885) is considered one of the most important German composers of the Romantic era. He was born in Weimar, where he studied with Friedrich Wilhelm Schlegel and Friedrich Nicolai. After working in Düsseldorf and Berlin, he settled in Vienna in 1840 and became a professor at the Academy of Music in 1853. Steinbrecht's compositions include operas, oratorios, chamber music, and songs. He is best known for his Symphony No. 4 (1859), which is considered one of the finest examples of late-romantic symphonic music.

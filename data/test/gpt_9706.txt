Russian Fedora Remix was created by Sergey Glushkov, who is a software engineer. Sergey Glushkov started working on Russian Fedora Remix in late 2013 and released it in early 2014. Russian Fedora Remix was based on Fedora 21, but it included additional software packages and modifications to make it more suitable for the Russian market.  Russian Fedora Remix was not well-received by the Fedora community, and it has since been discontinued. However, it has been cited as an example of how not to create a Fedora remix.

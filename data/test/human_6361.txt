Group Captain Thomas Gerard Hetherington CBE (19 June 1886 - 14 October 1951) was a British officer who served in the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. He was one of those credited with the initial development of the tank during the early part of the First World War. Although his design for an enormous wheeled vehicle proved to be impractical, it earned him a seat on the Landship Committee and he participated in early experiments with tracked vehicles. Early career Educated at Harrow School, Hetherington's interest in mechanics led him to a three-year apprenticeship with the Maudslay Motor Company. Commissioned into the 18th Hussars, Hetherington had represented both the army and Great Britain in equestrian competitions, until an accident left him unable to ride, whereupon he took up flying. Having earned the Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate No. 105 at Brooklands in July 1911, he transferred to No. 1 Company Air Battalion Royal Engineers which specialised in flying airships and was renamed No. 1 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps in May of the following year. In July 1914, he was seconded to the Royal Naval Air Service as an airship instructor. Following the outbreak of war, on 1 September Hetherington was appointed to No.3 Wing RNAS in Dunkirk as Transport Officer. The wing was commanded by the unconventional and aggressive Charles Rumney Samson, who had built from scratch a fleet of armoured cars which he used to harry the cavalry patrols of the German Army which was advancing into Belgium. Following the arrival of purpose-built armoured vehicles from the Admiralty, on 2 October Hetherington was given command of a section of five Wolseley armoured cars, representing one third of Samson's RNAS Armoured Car Section.

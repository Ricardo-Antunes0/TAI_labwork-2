The Ridgway family was one of the important dynasties manufacturing Staffordshire pottery, with a large number of family members and business names, over a period from the 1790s to the late 20th century. In their heyday in the mid-19th century there were several different potteries run by different branches of the family.  Most of their wares were earthenware, but often of very high quality, but stoneware and bone china were also made.  Many earlier pieces were unmarked and identifying them is difficult or impossible. Typically for Staffordshire, the various businesses, initially set up as partnerships, changed their official names rather frequently, and often used different trading names, so there are a variety of names that can be found. The various Ridgway companies made a huge range of wares, carefully following market demand.  They can generally be described as serving the middle and upper parts of the market, avoiding the cheapest popular wares. As with other factories, a great amount of good quality earthenware was transfer-printed with heavily elaborate designs, mostly in a durable underglaze cobalt blue.  Much of this went to the American market, and was given American designs of landscapes (the "Beauties of America" series dates to about 1820) and national heroes.

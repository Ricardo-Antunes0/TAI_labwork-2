IOSO (Indirect Optimization on the basis of Singular Values Problem) is a novel optimization algorithm for solving large scale problems in science, engineering and business.  The idea behind IOSO is to exploit the structure of the problem in order to improve the efficiency of the optimization process. IOSO is a nonlinear optimization algorithm that works on a coarser grain than many other optimization algorithms. This allows it to better explore the small-scale variations in the problem that may lead to improved performance.  IOSO has been found to be particularly effective at solving problems with high dimensional data, and it has been used to solve a broad range of problems in engineering and business. It has been used to solve problems in fields such as machine learning, control theory, bioinformatics and big data management.

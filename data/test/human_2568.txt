The pentimal system    is a notation for presenting numbers, usually by inscribing in wood or stone. The notation has been used in Scandinavia, usually in conjunction with runes. The notation is similar to the older Roman numerals for numbers 1 to 9 (I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX). Unlike the Roman notation, there are only symbols for numbers one ("I") and five ("U"). In inscriptions the notches are placed vertically on the stem or stav of the rune.  The number 4 is represented by four horizontal lines on the stem, 5 is represented by what looks like an inverted letter U. 10 is represented by two U's opposing each other. Numbers up to 19, or even 20, can be represented by a combination of I's and U's, just like the Roman numerals are represented by combinations of I's and V's. (A Roman 10 is represented by two V's opposing each other).

Dennis John Herod (27 October 1923 – 16 December 2009) was an English footballer. He played as a goalkeeper for Stockport County and Stoke City, both members of the Football League. Playing career Herod was born in Basford and joined Stoke City in 1940 from local non-league side Trent Vale United after impressing the watching Bob McGrory in the final of the Sentinel Shield. He made his debut during the 1940–41 with his first three matches ending in 5–1, 6–2 and 5–3 defeats, but despite this inauspicious start Herod was offered a professional contract. His war league appearances were restricted once he was called up to the 44th Royal Tank Regiment. Whilst training in Hampshire he guested for Aldershot along with Tommy Lawton, Joe Mercer and Stan Cullis. From 1943 Herod saw action in North Africa and Italy and narrowly escaped with his life when his tank received a direct hit in Normandy in August 1944, receiving only a fractured jaw.

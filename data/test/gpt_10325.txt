Isolezwe is a Zulu-language newspaper launched in Natal, South Africa in 1918. It was the first Zulu-language newspaper in the country and is still published today.  Isolezwe was founded by Themba Mbonambi, a Zulu nationalist and political leader. It was originally called Umsebenzi (meaning "our voice"), but changed its name to Isolezwe in 1919. The paper is published weekly and has a circulation of around 12,000.  Isolezwe is one of the few remaining Zulu-language newspapers in South Africa and is considered to be an important source of news and information for Zulu speakers in the province. It has been accused of being biased towards the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and has been criticised for its pro-Zulu editorial stance.

Roger N. Beachy is an American biologist, who has made significant contributions to the study of developmental biology. He is currently the John E. and Catherine T. MacArthur Professor of Developmental Biology at the University of Chicago, where he also holds the position of Ford Professor in the History of Science.  Beachy was born in 1951 in Buffalo, New York. He received his B.A. from Oberlin College in 1973 and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1978. He was a postdoctoral fellow at Rockefeller University from 1978 to 1980 and then a faculty member at Yale University until 1992, when he joined the faculty at the University of Chicago.  Beachy's work has focused on the study of how cells divide and grow, as well as on how genes control these processes. One of his most notable achievements is his development of a technique called "in vivo fertilization" (IVF), which is used to create embryos for medical research. Beachy also developed a method for studying how eggs develop into embryos, which is known as "in vitro fertilization with embryo transfer".

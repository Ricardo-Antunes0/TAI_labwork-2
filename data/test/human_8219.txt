The  is an automobile manufactured by the Japanese automaker Toyota across eleven generations between 1957 and 2001. On launch, the Corona was Toyota's next to highest product in their range, just below the Crown. The Corona was marketed in the JDM at Toyota's Toyopet Store dealership channels, and the Corona was one of Toyota's first models exported to other global markets, followed by the smaller Toyota Corolla.  The Corona played a key role in Toyota's North American success. Having previously entered the North American passenger car market in 1957 as Toyopet, the company met little success, withdrawing in 1961. The company re-entered the North American market in June of 1964, rebranded as Toyota â€” introducing its third generation rear-drive Corona, featuring a 90hp engine, four doors and numerous standard features (padded dash, visor mirror, full carpeting, fresh air heater/defroster, two-speed windshield wipers, quad headlamps, vinyl upholstery, driver's-side armrest, cigarette lighter, chrome wheel trim, undersealant, and twin horns) as well as available radio, factory-installed air conditioning and a two-speed automatic transmission. Toyota advertised the car prominently, underwriting its first television commercial, featuring the Corona. The car was well received, winning Road Test's 1969 Import Car of the Year. The Corona helped increase U.S. sales of Toyota vehicles to more than 20,000 units in 1966 (a threefold increase) and helped the company become the third-best-selling import brand in the United States by 1967. In 2014, editors at Car and Driver called the Corona one of the best Toyota's ever made, saying Toyota survived long enough to thrive in America because of the Corona.

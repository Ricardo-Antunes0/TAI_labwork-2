The Bryn Gwyn stones stand about  to the south-west of Castell Bryn Gwyn, on the low ridge some  above the valley of the Afon Braint on the Isle of Anglesey in Wales.  They are the tallest standing stones in Wales, nearly . In 1723 Henry Rowlands described them as part of a ruinous circle of eight stones, some  across. An account of 1797 says that "ignorant country people supposing money was hid under them tore them up" and today only two stones, one slab and one pillar, stand in a modern field bank. Nothing else is visible on the ground, but a 2008 excavation found three pits of standing stones, two containing stone stumps, consistent with the record by Rowlands. Further excavations in 2010 identified the pits of three more removed standing stones, making seven identified in all of the eight expected to make up the original circle.

In Greek mythology, Maera (Ancient Greek: Μαῖρα) was a giant hound who killed Argus, the giant with a hundred eyes.  The Maera is one of the oldest breeds of hunting dogs in Europe, and is a descendant of the giant hounds that were used by the ancient Greeks to hunt large game such as deer, boar, and antelope. The dog was bred in Hungary, and is also found in Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, and other parts of eastern and central Europe.

The Bosatlas is a Dutch atlas. Used in most schools, it remains the best selling atlas in the Netherlands. History The atlas was started by Pieter Roelf Bos, a Groningen teacher. The first atlas was published in 1877 with the name Bos' Schoolatlas der geheele aarde (Bos's School Atlas of the Whole Earth). Later editions were commonly called Bosatlas.  Bos continued to look after the production of the atlas until his death in 1902: his final production was the 15th edition. His successors were: J.F. Niermeyer (1903-1922, 16th up to and including the 27th edition), B.A. Kwast (1923-1936, from 1928 onward in cooperation with P. Eibergen, 28th up to and including the 35th edition) and P. Eibergen (1937-1955, 36th up to and including the 39th edition). The last of his successors to take individual responsibility for the Atlas was Dr. F.J. Ormeling (1956â€“1976, 40th up to and including the 48th edition). Since the 49th edition (1981) responsibility for the atlas has been collectively attributed and it is the publisher's name that has been highlighted in the atlas and associated marketing material.

The Big-4 League was a top level senior ice hockey league that operated in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta for two seasons between 1919 and 1921.  Created with the intention of competing for the Allan Cup senior-amateur championship, the league's existence was marred by accusations that its teams were secretly paying their players.  The Big-4 lost its amateur status after its first season and operated as an independent league until further accusations of the use of ineligible players led to its collapse in 1921.  Two of its teams, the Calgary Tigers and Edmonton Eskimos went on to form the professional Western Canada Hockey League. Founding By 1919, the Stanley Cup was no longer awarded to the top amateur team in Canada, reserved instead for the professional National and Pacific Coast leagues.  The Allan Cup had been established as the new amateur championship in its place.  The Big-4 was established in 1919 with the intention of bringing the Allan Cup to Alberta.

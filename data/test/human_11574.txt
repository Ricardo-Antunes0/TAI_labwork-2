CANZUK International is an international advocacy organisation which aims to achieve the free movement of citizens, free trade agreements and foreign policy cooperation between Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom through intergovernmental action and the formation of a proposed diplomatic alliance known as CANZUK.  The organisation aims to achieve similar free movement and trade arrangements that exist under the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement and the Closer Economic Relations trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand, with Canada and the United Kingdom eventually joining these arrangements. History The Commonwealth Freedom of Movement Organisation (CFMO) was founded in January 2015 by executive director, James Skinner, who conceptualized and popularized the idea of developing migration, trade and foreign policy agreements between Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom by developing political interest for CANZUK among supportive MPs in Canada. Skinner founded the CFMO after experiencing his own difficulties immigrating to Australia and Canada as a UK citizen.

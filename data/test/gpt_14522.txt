Manfred Uhlig (2 September 1927 - 24 October 2018) was a German chemist and academic who was a professor at the University of Manchester. He was known for his work on organometallic chemistry and coordination chemistry.  Manfred Uhlig was born on 2 September 1927 in Berlin, Germany. He studied chemistry at the University of Berlin, where he received his doctorate in 1951. From 1951 to 1957, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. He then returned to Germany, where he became a professor at the University of Munich. In 1988, he moved to the University of Manchester, where he remained a professor until his death in 2018.  Manfred Uhlig's work in organometallic chemistry and coordination chemistry has been highly influential in the field of chemistry. His work on coordination compounds, particularly tetrahedral complexes, has led to significant advances in understanding the chemical reactivity of complex metal systems. Additionally, his work on organometallic compounds has provided insights into the fundamental mechanisms by which these materials are activated and catalyzed in chemical reactions. Manfred Uhlig was also a prolific writer, publishing more than 150 scientific articles and book chapters throughout his career. He was awarded the Otto Hahn Medal in 1990 and the Berlinguer Medal in 2003 by the Italian Chemical Society. Manfred Uhlig died on 24 October 2018 at the age of 96.

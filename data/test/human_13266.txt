Ordgarius monstrosus is a species of spider in the orb-weaver spider family Araneidae, found in Queensland, Australia. O. monstrosus is a bolas spider. Rather than using a web, adult females catch their prey by using a line with one or two sticky drops (a "bolas") which they swing. Description A female described in 1886 had a total length of 13.0 mm. The cephalothorax was 5.0 mm long and almost as wide. Its upper surface was reddish brown, with white hairs and five projections, a long forward-pointing one at the front and four smaller ones behind. The two rows of eyes were slightly recurved. The sternum was longer than wide, and was yellow with brown tints, as were the chelicerae. The legs were yellow with brown rings, mostly not fully closed, and were covered with fine white hairs. The first leg was longest, with a total length of 15.5 mm. The abdomen was wider (10.2 mm) than long (9.6 mm). Its upper surface was yellow with brown spots and indistinct bands. The corners had distinct humps. The underside of the abdomen was solid yellow.

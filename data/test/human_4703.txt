Amphion (1886 â€“ 30 October 1906) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse. He won some minor races as a two-year-old, but was not entered into any of the Classics. As a three-year-old he won several races including the Great Jubilee Stakes. He improved again as a four-year-old, winning the Hardwicke Stakes, Lancashire Plate and Champion Stakes, beating several classic winners in the process. He remained in training as a five-year-old, winning the March Stakes and Rous Memorial Stakes. Amphion was trained by Mr. Chandler and owned by General Byrne. As a stallion he sired several top class horses including the sprinter Sundridge, Champion Stakes winner Dieudonne and Eclipse Stakes winner Lally. Background Amphion was a chestnut colt foaled in 1886 and bred by G. S. Thompson. He was sired by either Speculum or his son Rosebery. Speculum was champion sire of Great Britain in 1878, when his son Sefton won the Derby. Rosebery won both the Cesarewitch Handicap and Cambridgeshire Handicap in 1876. The uncertainty over his paternity was due to Speculum dying shortly after covering Amphion's dam. His dam then came in heat and she was covered again by Rosebery. Amphion's dam was Suicide, a daughter of Hermit.

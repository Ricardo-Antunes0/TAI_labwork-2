The Four Temperaments or Theme and Four Motives was a work of Renaissance humanist psychology by the Italian physician and philosopher Leonardo da Vinci. It was published posthumously in 1599.  The work is an attempt to classify people according to their natural tendencies, based on their character traits. It is also known as the "theory of the four humours" or "the theory of the four temperaments".  The work is divided into four books, each dealing with one of the four temperaments: sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic, and melancholic. Each book is organised around a particular set of character traits: nature, cause, effects, and management.  The theory of the four temperaments was influential in the 18th and 19th centuries and has been revived in recent years.

Jennifer W. Knust is a Professor of Sociology at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and a faculty affiliate at the Center for Research on Race and Ethnicity. She has written extensively on social inequality, racism, and social stratification in the United States, focusing on topics such as race and ethnicity in education, residential segregation, and income inequality.   Knust is known for her work on the concept of whiteness as an identity category, which has led her to explore how race and ethnicity are socially constructed and policed. She has also written on issues of privilege and power, particularly in relation to race and ethnicity. Knust has been a frequent commentator on racial issues in the United States, appearing on television programs such as MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews and The Rachel Maddow Show, as well as in articles for The Huffington Post and The New York Times. In 2016, she was named a MacArthur Fellow.

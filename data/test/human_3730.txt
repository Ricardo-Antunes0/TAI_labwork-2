Praying towns were a series of settlements established by English colonial governments in New England from 1646 to 1675 in an effort to convert local Native Americans to Christianity. The native people who moved into these towns were known as Praying Indians. Before 1674 the villages were the most ambitious experiment in converting Native Americans to Christianity in the Thirteen Colonies, and led to the creation of the first books in an Algonquian language, including the first bible printed in British North America. During King Philip's War from 1675 to 1678, many praying towns were depopulated, in part due to forced internment of praying Indians on Deer Island, many of whom died during the winter of 1675. After the war, many of the originally allotted praying towns were never reestablished, however some praying towns persisted. Many present day indigenous groups in New England trace their heritage to praying towns, including the Mashpee Wampanoag, the Ponkapoag and Natick Massachusett, and the Chaubunagungamaug and Hassanamisco Nipmuc. History  John Eliot was an English colonist and Puritan minister who played an important role in the establishment of praying towns. In the 1630s and 1640s, Eliot worked with bilingual indigenous Algonquians including John Sassamon, an orphan of the Smallpox pandemic of 1633, and Cockenoe, an enslaved Montauk prisoner of the Pequot War, to translate several Christian works, eventually including the Bible, into Massachusett. Having learned enough Massachusett to preach, Eliot began evangelism with the Neponset band of Massachusetts, but was first well received when preaching at in 1646 at Nonantum in present day Newton, meaning "place of rejoicing" in Massachusett. This sermon led to a friendship with Waban (Nipmuc, c. 1604â€“c.1685), who became the first Native American in Massachusetts to convert to Christianity.

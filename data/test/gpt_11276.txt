Samangala Aranya Senasanaya or Samangala Forest Hermitage is a Buddhist hermitage located in the Samangala Aranya Forest Reserve in the Western Province of Sri Lanka. The hermitage is administered by the Maha Vihara of Amarapura and the Buddhist Publication Society of Sri Lanka.  The hermitage was founded in 1881 by Buddhist monk Aturuwariya when he established a Buddhist monastery in the forest reserve. The monastery later became a hermitage, and is now home to a small number of monks. The hermitage is open to visitors from Monday to Friday, between 07:00 and 17:00, and admission is free.

Great American Bank was an American savings and loan association based in San Diego. It was founded in 1885 as San Diego Building and Loan Association, the first S&L in Southern California. Until the 1980s, it operated for decades as San Diego Federal Savings and Loan Association. Federal regulators seized and disbanded the bank in 1991. Before the company was split apart, Great American had 213 offices operating in California, Arizona, Washington, Montana, and Colorado. History San Diego Building and Loan Association was founded on July 11, 1885. Its initial capital stock was $500,000 from 2,500 shares at $200 each. The company changed from a state charter to a federal charter in 1936, when it became San Diego Federal Savings and Loan Association. It began a stretch of eight mergers with other S&Ls starting in December 1980, during which it changed its name to Great American Federal Savings and Loan Association in 1982. The name change reflected their business going from four offices in San Diego County in 1970 to over 100 statewide after the completed mergers. It changed back from a federal to a state charter in 1984, when it changed its name to Great American First Savings Bank.

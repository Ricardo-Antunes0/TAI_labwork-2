The Soldiers is a singing trio consisting of Katherine Jenkins, Alfie Boe and Nadine Coyle. The group was formed in 2007 by Jenkins and Boe, who were working together at the time as solo artists. Coyle, a former member of Westlife, was added to the group in 2009.  The Soldiers first achieved international acclaim when they were selected to sing the anthem at the Closing Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games. The trio has since released three studio albums: "The Soldiers" (2009), "In the Name of Love" (2011) and "Heartbeats" (2013). They have also released two singles, "Stronger" and "Someone to Watch Over Me". In 2015, they released their fourth album, "The Light Within".

Frederic Middlebrook Richards (August 19, 1925 â€“ March 1, 2001) was an American physicist who shared the Nobel Prize in 1981 with Murray Gell-Mann for their work on the quark model of the strong interaction.  Richards was born in Providence, Rhode Island, to Samuel and Esther Middlebrook Richards. He received his B.A. from Brown University in 1947 and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1951. He then worked at the University of Chicago until 1957, when he moved to the University of California, Santa Cruz. There he became a professor in 1967 and was chairman of the physics department from 1978 to 1981. He was also a visiting professor at various universities, including the University of Geneva and the University of Rome.  Richards was known for his work on the quark model of the strong interaction and for his contributions to quantum field theory. With Murray Gell-Mann, he developed a model that described how hadrons (atomic particles made up of quarks) interact. This model has been used to explain a wide range of phenomena, including the properties of atoms and molecules. Richards also developed a theory of symmetry breaking in particle physics, which has been important in understanding the behavior of high-energy particles.  Richards was a recipient of numerous awards and honors, including the National Medal of Science (1978), the National Medal of Technology and Innovation (1988), and the Nobel Prize in 1981. He died on March 1, 2001, at the age

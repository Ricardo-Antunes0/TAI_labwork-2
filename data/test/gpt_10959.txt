Christ Church Glendower is the oldest (and, as of 2006, only surviving) Anglican church in Australia. It is located in the small town of Glendower, New South Wales, about half an hour's drive from the city of Sydney.  The first Christian services in what is now known as Glendower were conducted by the Rev. Samuel Marsden in 1789. The first church was a modest wooden building erected on the property of Major General John Macarthur and his wife Elizabeth. In 1801, the church was moved to its present site, a picturesque location on a hill overlooking the town.  The church has a long and varied history. In 1853, it became the first place of worship in Australia to be dedicated to the Virgin Mary. In 1884, it became one of the first churches in Australia to be fitted with electric lighting. In 1932, it was severely damaged by a cyclone and had to be rebuilt.  In 2006, Christ Church Glendower celebrated its 200th anniversary. The church is currently served by a lay minister and a small team of volunteers.

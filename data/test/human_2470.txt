Anthony Rasch von Tauffkirchen (c. 1778 - November 25, 1858) was a German-American silversmith, active in Philadelphia (1804-1820) and New Orleans (1820-1858). According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, his works are credited with being "among the most sophisticated silver vessels produced in the United States in the early nineteenth century." Rasch was born in Bavaria, probably in the Schloss Kleeberg, as the second son of Maximilian, Count von Tauffkirchen, and his third wife, Gertrude. He trained as a goldsmith in Germany before arriving in Philadelphia, with his wife, on April 16, 1804. By 1806 Rasch had joined the Holy Trinity Catholic Church, and by 1807 he began working in the shop of French émigré silversmith and retailer Jean-Simon Chaudron (1758–1846). In 1809 they became partners as Chaudron & Rasch, with Rasch running their manufactory on the Schuylkill River and Chaudron running the retail shop in Philadelphia. The 1810 federal census recorded 27 people living and working at Rasch's manufactory, the largest household in the township. The partners created sterling silverware sold as far away as New York and Virginia, usually stamped with two banner marks, "CHAUDRON'S & RASCH" and "STER•AMERI•MAN•" (an abbreviation for "Sterling, American Manufacture.")

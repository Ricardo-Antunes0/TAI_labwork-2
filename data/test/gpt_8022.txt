Chimney sweep's cancer, also called soot wart, is a form of cancer that affects the respiratory system. It is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is a type of virus. The virus is spread through contact with saliva, blood, or other bodily fluids from an infected person.   The most common type of chimney sweep's cancer is bronchioalveolar carcinoma (BAC), which accounts for about 75% of cases. Other types of chimney sweep's cancer include laryngeal cancer, esophageal cancer, and rectal cancer. BAC is the most deadly form of chimney sweep's cancer and is almost always fatal. However, early diagnosis and treatment can improve the chances of survival.

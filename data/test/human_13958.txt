Joey Gregorash is a Canadian singer and musician from Winnipeg, Manitoba who became the first solo Manitoba act to win a Juno Award in 1972 for Outstanding Performance-Male. Career overview In 1965 Gregorash became a founding member of popular Winnipeg-area band the Mongrels. Originally on drums, by 1966 Gregorash was organist and lead singer for the group which, from 1968, would record five singles for the local Franklin label, with two albums released. In 1969 Gregorash left the Mongrels and after fronting the group Walrus - not connected with the like-named UK progrock outfit - signed as a solo act with Polydor Records. Subsequent to two single releases in the autumn of 1970, Gregorash appeared at the notorious Niverville Pop Festival, leading the crowd in the FISH chant from Woodstock, and recorded his debut album North Country Funk at Stax Studios in Memphis in January and May 1971, with the advance single "Jodie" being issued in March 1971, which became an international hit after charting in Germany, Japan, Australia and reaching #3 on the Canadian charts.

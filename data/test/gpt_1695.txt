In computer science, more precisely, in the field of natural language processing, synchronization is the process of ensuring that a set of linguistic units (words, letters, phrases) occur together in a given sequence in order to produce a meaningful message.  Synchronization can be achieved by a number of methods, including, but not limited to, word matching, timing, and counting. Synchronization is necessary for the production of human-readable text from machine-generated text.

Hugh Rees Christopher Mendl (6 August 1919, Vienna, Austria – 21 October 1997, London, England) was an Austrian-born British composer who worked in the classical and popular genres.  Mendl was born into a musical family in Vienna. He studied at the Vienna Academy of Music and Theatre, where he was taught by László Ligeti and Arnold Schoenberg. In 1941, he emigrated to Britain, where he became a naturalised citizen in 1947. Mendl initially worked as a conductor and music teacher, but he soon began composing music for films and television. He composed the score for the 1966 film A Man for All Seasons, which won him an Academy Award nomination. Mendl's best-known works include the opera The Midsummer Night's Dream (1961), the ballet Petrushka (1962), the orchestral piece Requiem (1970), and the piano piece Three Pieces for Orchestra (1973). He also wrote several popular songs, including "The Look of Love" and "Put It All On Me". Mendl died in London at the age of 80.

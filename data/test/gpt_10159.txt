The Prater Liliputbahn is a  gauge miniature railway in the Prater amusement park in Vienna, Austria. It is one of the most popular attractions in the park. The railway runs through a miniature version of the Prater amusement park, including an amusement park, a lake, and a castle.  The railway was built in 1979 by the then owners of the Prater amusement park, the Grazer KG. It was initially operated by a manually operated steam locomotive and several carriages. In 1990 it was electrified with two 6 kV AC overhead lines. The line was extended to its present length in 1998.

Bachaler Olaszkai (; died around 1300) was a Hungarian medieval soldier and lesser noble in the second half of the 13th century. He served as castellan of Koprivnica (Kapronca) in 1272, when King Stephen V's son and heir, Ladislaus was abducted and imprisoned there. Military service Bachaler was born into a lesser noble family of possible castle warrior origin, which possessed some landholdings in Vas County. His father was a certain Vida, who owned the estate of Olaszka (present-day belongs to Olaszfa). He had two brothers, Lawrence and Kemény. Bachaler joined the royal army in the summer of 1253, when Béla IV of Hungary launched a campaign against the Margraviate of Moravia, ruled by his long-standing enemy, Ottokar. During the campaign, Bachaler fought at the walls of the castle Pirill, where one of his relatives was perished. For his service and bravery, Bachaler was granted the estate of Szarakad by Béla IV in 1255, two years later. Prior to that, the land belonged to the ispánate of Vasvár and laid near his family's centre, Olaszka. With his brothers and other relatives, Bachaler divided their inherited and jointly owned land, Olaszka on 26 September 1258. He received a relatively insignificant portion.

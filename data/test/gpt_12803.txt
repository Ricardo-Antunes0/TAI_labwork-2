Eurythmic (1916â€“1925) was a versatile Australian-bred Thoroughbred racehorse who won three consecutive Melbourne Cups.  Eurythmic was foaled in 1916 at the property of J. S. Crawford near Geelong, Victoria. He was sired by the English stallion, Arundel, and out of the mare, Annie's Pride. His dam, Lady Alice, was a daughter of the Australian champion racehorse, Menai.  Eurythmic began his racing career in 1917 as a two-year-old in New South Wales and finished second to the outstanding filly Phar Lap in the New South Wales Derby. In Melbourne he finished second to Phar Lap in the 1918 Melbourne Cup and then won the 1919 and 1920 Melbourne Cups.  During his racing career Eurythmic carried seventy-five pounds less than his rivals and was said to move like a cat on footsticks. He retired from racing at the age of four in 1925 to become a breeding stallion at Crawford's property near Geelong. He had some success as a sire of racehorses but is best known for his influence on Australian thoroughbred racing.

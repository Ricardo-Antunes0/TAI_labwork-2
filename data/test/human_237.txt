An icebox cake (American) or chocolate ripple cake or log (Australian) is a dessert typically made with cream, fruits, nuts, and wafers and set in the refrigerator. The term can refer to a general category of dishes that involve the same process, and one particularly well-known version is the back-of-the-box recipe on thin and dark Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers. History The icebox cake is derived from similar desserts such as the charlotte and the trifle, but made to be more accessible for housewives to prepare. It was first introduced to the United States in the 1930s, as companies were promoting the icebox as a kitchen appliance. Its popularity rose in the 1920s and 30s, as it used many commercial shortcuts and pre-made ingredients. In response to the dish's popularity, companies that manufactured ingredients for the cake, such as condensed milk and wafer cookies, began printing recipes on the backs of their boxes.

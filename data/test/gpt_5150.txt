Jordan Aviation (PSC) is an airline based in Amman, Jordan. It is the flag carrier of Jordan and was founded in 1962. The airline operates scheduled and chartered passenger services to over 50 destinations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and North America.  Jordan Aviation's origins can be traced back to 1962 when the Jordanian government established a company called Jordan Aviation Services to operate charter flights for tourists visiting the country. The company was re-branded as Jordan Airlines in 1984 and started scheduled services the following year. Jordan Airlines became a state-owned company in 1992. In 2006, it was privatized and international investors were brought on board to help revitalize the airline. Jordan Aviation currently has a fleet of nine Airbus A320s, fifteen Airbus A330s, three Boeing 737s and one Boeing 757.

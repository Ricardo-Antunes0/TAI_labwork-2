In geometry, the orientation, angular position, attitude, or rotation of a figure is its position in space, relative to some fixed reference point, or to itself if it is self-contained. This article discusses the various concepts of orientation in Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry.  In Euclidean geometry, a figure is said to be oriented if its angular position (in radians) relative to a fixed point is known. The orientation of a figure can be determined by projecting it onto a plane and measuring the angle between the projected line and the line perpendicular to the plane at the fixed point. The orientation of a figure can also be determined by finding the vector that points from the center of the figure to any given point on its surface.  In non-Euclidean geometry, orientation is not always defined in terms of angular position. Instead, orientation may be defined in terms of any other coordinate system, such as Cartesian coordinates or polar coordinates. In these coordinate systems, orientation is determined by finding the vector that points from the center of the figure to any given point on its surface.

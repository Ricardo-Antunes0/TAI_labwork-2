Clarion is a commercial, proprietary, fourth-generation programming language created by Silicon Graphics, Inc. in 1989. It was designed to provide a high-level, object-oriented programming language with the performance characteristics of assembly language.  Clarion is used primarily in the graphics and entertainment industries, but has been used in a number of other applications as well. The language has been superseded by later versions, but remains in use by a small number of developers.

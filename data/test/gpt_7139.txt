A radio communication station is a set of radio equipment used for the transmission of voice, music, or other information, either simultaneously or in sequence. They are typically used by governments, militaries, and large corporations.  Radio communication stations can be classified according to their purposes: long-distance, local area, or point-to-point. Radio communication stations can also be classified according to their frequency ranges: VHF for short-range communication, UHF for long-range communication, and SHF for ultra high frequency.

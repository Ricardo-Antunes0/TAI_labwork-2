The 'Obby 'Oss festival is a folk music festival held annually in Obby, a town in the Northern Territory, Australia.   The festival is held in late August or early September and showcases the traditional music of the Australian Aboriginal people. It has been described as "one of the most important Aboriginal music festivals in Australia" and "one of the most significant events in the history of Aboriginal culture in the Northern Territory".  The festival features performances by a range of traditional and contemporary Aboriginal musicians, as well as family entertainment and cultural exhibits. The organisers aim to promote Aboriginal culture and heritage through the festival, and have raised over A$1 million since its inception in 1994.

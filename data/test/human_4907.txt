Anna Frances Levins (March 21, 1876 – July 15, 1941) was an Irish American photographer, publisher, author, painter and activist whose works appeared in publications including The New York Times, Vogue and The Boston Globe. She was lauded as “a pioneer woman photographer and a leader in Irish cultural pursuits.” Her portrait sitters included Pope Pius X, William Henry O’Connell, Eamon de Valera and John McCormack. The Levins Press, a company she founded and ran in New York and Dublin, published illustrated books about Irish history, literature, culture and independence battles by authors including her husband, Sir Thomas Henry Grattan Esmonde (1862-1935), an Irish baronet. She turned part of her Manhattan office into “a gallery of Irish heroes,” exhibiting her photos and paintings of Irish leaders and martyrs, including Kevin Barry, who were executed after the 1916 Easter Rising. Biography  Levins was one of six surviving children of the builder Peter Levins (1815-September 26, 1894) and Nanno Hale (March 25, 1836 – May 13, 1929), Irish immigrants who settled on the Lower East Side and then the Bronx. Peter's brother Thomas C. Levins was an early pastor at St. Patrick's Old Cathedral whose library became a foundational core of Georgetown University's library. Anna Frances and her sisters Clare, Elizabeth (a clerk for the Board of Education), and Julia (a schoolteacher) long lived with their widowed mother Nanno. Anna Frances attended St. Brigid's school on the Lower East Side, where she studied portrait painting. By the early 1900s she had apprenticed with photographer George G. Rockwood and then traveled in Europe, taking photographs of celebrated figures including Edward VII. By 1909 she was deemed “one of the few women to have a real success of photography in all its phases.”

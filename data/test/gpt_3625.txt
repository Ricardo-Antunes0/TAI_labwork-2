The Patriarchal Cathedral Basilica of Saint Mark is the largest and most famous of the eleven papal basilicas in Rome. It is also the most ancient and the largest church in Rome, with a total area of 68,000 square metres.  Saint Mark's Basilica was begun by Emperor Constantine I in 326 and completed by his son Constantine II in 335. It is located in the Piazza di San Marco, at the heart of the city near the Campidoglio hill. The present building occupies part of the original site of a 4th-century Christian basilica, which was destroyed by an earthquake in 846. The reconstruction of Saint Mark's began in 1063 under Pope Nicholas II and was completed in 1260.  The interior is a composition of a nave, two aisles, and transepts, with a roof supported by 88 marble pillars. The nave is 27.4 metres wide, the aisles are 19.2 metres wide, and the transepts are 17.8 metres wide. The ceiling is decorated with frescos by Giotto and his pupils, including The Last Judgement and The Crucifixion. Other notable features include the gold altar frontal and the Shrine of Saint Anthony of Padua

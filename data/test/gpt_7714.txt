The Huddersfield workhouse scandal  concerned the conditions in which inmates of the Huddersfield workhouse were allegedly forced to live.  The workhouse scandal first came to light in 1884, when a group of inmates staged a protest against their appalling living conditions. In 1889, an investigation by the Royal Commission on the Poor Law revealed that inmates were living in squalid and unhealthy conditions, with little or no access to medical care. The scandal led to major changes in the way the workhouse system was operated, and ultimately led to the abolition of the workhouse system in England and Wales.

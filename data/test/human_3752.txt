Henry Gregory (15 March 1860 â€“ 15 November 1940) was an Australian politician. He was a Ministerialist member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly from 1897 to 1911, representing the electorates of North Coolgardie (1897-1901) and Menzies (1901-1911). He was state Minister for Mines from 1901 to 1904 under George Leake and Walter James and Minister for Mines and Railways from 1905 to 1911 under Hector Rason, Newton Moore and Frank Wilson. He rose to become Treasurer from 1910 to 1911, a role that also entailed him acting as Premier if Wilson was absent, but lost his seat at the 1911 state election. He subsequently entered federal politics as a member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1913 until his death in 1940, representing the electorates of Dampier (1911-1922) and Swan (1922-1940). He was initially a member of the Commonwealth Liberal Party and its successor the Nationalist Party, but joined the new Country Party in 1920 and was its deputy leader from 1921 to 1922.

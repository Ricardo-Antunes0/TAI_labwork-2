Socpresse was a French corporation which controlled the conservative daily newspaper Le Figaro, the weekly magazine L'Express, 40% of the weekly Le Journal du Dimanche,  Valeurs Actuelles, and the football club FC Nantes. The company was acquired by the Dassault in September 2006. Before that date, 13% of the shares belonged to Aude Ruettard, the granddaughter of Robert Hersant.

In total, the Socpresse group owned about 70 newspapers.

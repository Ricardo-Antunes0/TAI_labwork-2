Mount Bona is one of the major mountain peaks in the Southern Alps, located on the border of the Australian state of Victoria and New South Wales. With an elevation of 2,884 metres (9,526 ft), it is Victoria's tenth-highest mountain peak and the highest point within the Southern Alps.  The mountain is named after Bona Sesquicentenaire, a French explorer who first sighted it in 1836. Mount Bona was first ascended by a party of three Austrians in 1858. The mountain's north face was first climbed in 1894 by a British team led by Cecil Sharp. Mount Bona was extensively glaciated during the last ice age and remains covered in glaciers to this day.  The mountain is part of the Bona Expeditions mountaineering route, which links the summit of Mount Bona with Mount Hotham.

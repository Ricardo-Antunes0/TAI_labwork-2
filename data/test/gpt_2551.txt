The barracks were used by Royal Navy ships until 1869, when they were abandoned and destroyed. In 1875, a new naval barracks was built on part of the marshland and this continued to be used until 1999. Today, most of Lamplighters Marsh is used for recreational purposes, including football, cricket and tennis.

The Skyluck was a 3,500-ton Panamanian-registered freighter that carried a cargo of 3,300 Chinese and Vietnamese boat people fleeing Vietnam four years after the fall of Saigon.  The ship left Vietnam from the Mekong delta city of Báº¿n Tre, on January 24 1979, and after a sea voyage entered Hong Kong harbour under the cover of darkness on 8 February 1979. It was discovered and ordered to set anchor by the Hong Kong Police. Thus, began a -month-long stalemate as the refugees waited on the ship for the Hong Kong government to decide their fate.  The event turned into an international humanitarian incident, which was a symbol of a much larger problem: the estimated one million refugees who risked everything to flee Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Journey and Arrival in Hong Kong In the early hours of Wednesday 7 February 1979, Skyluck arrived in the then-British colony of Hong Kong unannounced.  Hong Kong police did not detect the ship as it entered the territorial waters, until it anchored in the middle of Victoria Harbour. The ship was surrounded by police launches and boarded in the morning hours. Engine parts were removed to prevent escape.

CJ Lim (born Chwen Jeng Lim, 1964 in Malaysia) is the Academic Professor of Architecture and Urbanism at The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment at University College London (UCL); and served as Vice-Dean and Pro-Provost of University College London. He is the founder and director of Studio 8 Architects, a UK-based multidisciplinary and international practice in sustainable urban planning, architecture and landscape, focusing on interpretations of social, cultural and environmental programmes. Along with Simon Dickens and Bernd Felsinger (2006-2016), Lim leads PG Unit 10 within The Bartlett School of Architecture's  Architecture MArch (ARB/RIBA Part 2) course. Lim's research of cities is developed through a new urban paradigm â€“ the 'Smartcity'. The work addresses what the spatial and phenomenological implications are when sustainable design is applied to a city and the role that citizens play in the production of a relevant social space. A central component of the Smartcity is the establishment of an ecological symbiosis between nature and built form to create diverse forms of resilient landscapes and urbanism including and beyond urban agriculture.

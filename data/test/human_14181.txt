Blood's Too Rich by Luke Doucet & the White Falcon is Luke Doucet's third studio album. The album was released in Canada on January 8, 2008 by Six Shooter Records.  Six Shooter Records released the album in the United States on June 24, 2008. In an interview for Exclaim!, Doucet commented on how the album compared with his previous album, Broken: Broken was very much single-themed. It was a break-up record about broken hearts and wallowing in pity and self-despair. In comparison, this record is looser, thanks to the help of the band the White Falcon. Although they worked on the last record, this is three-and-a-half years later, where they've actually become a band, rather than it being just me and the people I hire. I hope that comes across, because that's deliberate. It was deliberate to treat the process as one involving my band and friends as opposed to my employees.

Unspiek, Baron Bodissey, is a fictional character in the novel and film series The Lord of the Rings. He is a nobleman and the hereditary Steward of Gondor.  Baron Bodissey was born in Gondor in the year 547 of the Third Age. He was the son of Beregond, who was the steward of Gondor in the years preceding the War of the Ring. When Beregond died in battle against the Corsairs of Umbar, Bodissey was only sixteen years old, but he proved himself a capable and able leader. He successfully defended Osgiliath from an Orc siege, and then led a relief force to the city's relief.  In 597, Bodissey was made Steward of Gondor by King Elessar. Under his stewardship, Gondor recovered from its wounds and began to rebuild its strength. He also began a program of road-building, which greatly aided trade within the kingdom. In 602, Bodissey married Olwen, daughter of Orodreth, Lord of Lossarnach. Together they had two sons: EÃ¤rnur and Faramir.  In 606, during a battle against raiders from Rhudaur, Bodissey was grievously wounded by an arrow which entered his back and came out his chest. Despite his best efforts to save himself, he died soon afterwards. His body was brought back to Minas Tirith and buried there beside Bereg

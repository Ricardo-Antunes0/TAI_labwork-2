Donald Frederick Joseph (April 13, 1923 â€“ July 24, 2007) was an American jazz drummer.  Born in Rochester, New York, Joseph played with Sonny Rollins and Lester Young before moving to Britain in the early 1950s. He became one of the most successful drummers in the history of British jazz, playing with leading British jazz bands such as the John Dankworth Orchestra and the Ronnie Scott Group. He also appeared on numerous recordings by British artists, including Jackie McLean and June Christy. Joseph returned to the United States in the late 1970s, and continued to play occasional concerts until his death in 2007.

The  voyageurs  were 18th and 19th century French Canadians who engaged in the transporting of furs via canoe during the peak of the North American fur trade.  The emblematic meaning of the term applies to places (New France, including the Pays d'en Haut and the Pays des Illinois) and times where transportation of materials was mainly over long distances. The voyageurs were regarded as legendary. They were heroes celebrated in folklore and music. For reasons of promised celebrity status and wealth, this position was coveted. Despite the fame surrounding the voyageur, their life was one of toil and not nearly as glorious as folk tales make it out to be. For example, they had to be able to carry two  bundles of fur over portages. Some carried up to four or five, and there is a report of a voyageur carrying seven bundles for half of a mile. Hernias were common and frequently caused death. Most voyageurs would start working in their early twenties, and they would continue working until they were in their sixties. They never made enough money to consider an early retirement from what was a physically grueling lifestyle.

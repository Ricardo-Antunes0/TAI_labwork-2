The northern boobook (Ninox japonica) belongs to the family Strigidae (true owls) and is a raptorial owl endemic to eastern and southern countries of Asia. The species was considered, until recently, a conspecific of Ninox scutulata or brown boobook, a species of similar distribution encompassing 11 subspecies. The species currently includes two subspecies, the migrant Ninox japonica japonica and the non-migrant Ninox japonica totogo. Despite being considered as the most common breeding owl in Japan, little research has been conducted on the species and subspecies and the taxonomic classification of N.j.togoto and N.j.japonica has been a subject of debate. There are no indications of significant decline in northern boobook populations and therefore, its conservation status has been classified as least concern by the IUCN Red List. Description  Ninox japonica is a hawk owl species with a body length averaging between 29 and 33 cm and a wingspan of approximately 60 to 70 cm wide.  Current knowledge on the species shows no sexual dimorphism and an average weight of approximately 168g. The northern boobook has a hawk-like appearance and its subspecies are practically undistinguishable. Individuals of the species will have a brown back and wings with lighter brown horizontal streaks on the tail feathers. The neck, crown and face of this bird are slightly more greyish brown aside from a small white patch above the beak. It has striking yellow gold eyes, a black beak and yellow talons. Its belly is almost completely white aside from rust-colored specs, which bare similarity to its sister species the brown boobook (N. scutulata). Aside from mitochondrial distinction, research has determined that subspecies of Ninox japonica, N. japonica totogo and N. japonica japonica, can be differentiated through the shorter wing chord (214-217mm) and the longer tail (118mm) of N. totogo. This has been hypothesized to be an adaption due to the migratory nature of N. j. totogo.

Siam Square  is a shopping and entertainment district in Bangkok, Thailand. The area is located in the city's center and has a few high-rise buildings and shopping complexes.  The area was formerly the site of the Royal Palace, until it was moved to the Phra Pathom Chedi area in 1782. The first buildings were erected in the early 20th century in an attempt to revive Bangkok's downtown area which had declined due to overcrowding and poor sanitation. In 1933, Siam Square was renamed Ratchadamnoen Avenue in honor of Prince Ratchadamnoen, the then-Prince of Siam.   The square originally contained mostly small shops and restaurants, but since the 1990s it has been gradually rebuilt into a high-end shopping and entertainment district. Several high-rise buildings have been constructed, including Siam Paragon, which is the tallest building in Thailand. The district is also home to several large malls, including Emporium and Central World.  Siam Square is popular for its nightlife, which includes bars and nightclubs. It is also a popular tourist destination, particularly during the Christmas holiday season.

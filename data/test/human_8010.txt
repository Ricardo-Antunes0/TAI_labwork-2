The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002. History  This land was part of the first hospital complex serving the early colony. The second brick ward/store was erected on this site. After the hospital moved in 1816, the land remained vacant. William Charles was granted the land in 1842 when he divided it into three lots, however he appears to have control of it from the 1830s. A brick building was initially built on the southern portion of the site in 1832 by Elizabeth Charles. Charles' land was formally subdivided in 1842 but appears to have been effectively used as three separate lots before that. These lots were developed as follows: Lot 111 (northern lot) vacant until 1845 when a single storey timber house was built, demolished 1861. Lot 113 (middle lot) vacant until 1841 when a two-storey brick house was built, demolished 1861. Lot 115 (southern lot) vacant until 1832 when a two-storey brick house was built, demolished 1862.

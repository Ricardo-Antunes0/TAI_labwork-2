17 Leporis is a binary star system in the Lepus constellation. The primary component is a white dwarf star, 17 Lep, which is the second-brightest star in the constellation. The system is about 162 light years from Earth.  17 Leporis is a relatively close binary star system, located just 16.5 light years from Earth. It consists of a white dwarf star (17 Lep) and its companion star (16 Lep), which orbits around the white dwarf every 2.7 days.  The primary component, 17 Lep, is a faint white dwarf only visible to amateur astronomers with good equipment. Because of its low brightness, it was only detected in 1978 using the Palomar Transient Factory. It was first classified as a probable binary by Charles Kowal in 1984, but was not confirmed until 2002 by Andrew Fraknoi and his team using the Hubble Space Telescope. The companion star, 16 Lep, is an orange-hued main-sequence star that is slightly more massive than the white dwarf and has a temperature of about 4,000 K.

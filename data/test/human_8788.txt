Susan Sto Helit (also spelled Sto-Helit), once referred to as Susan Death, is a fictional character in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series of fantasy novels. She is the adoptive granddaughter of Death, the Disc's Grim Reaper, and has a number of his abilities. She appears in three Discworld novels: Soul Music, Hogfather, and Thief of Time. She is also referred to, though not by name, at the end of Mort, when her father invites Death to her christening. Being both human and supernatural, Susan is frequently and reluctantly forced away from her normal life to do battle with malign supernatural forces or to take on her grandfather's job in his absence. Death tends to employ her in his battles against the Auditors of Reality, particularly in situations where he has no power or influence. As the series progresses, she also begins to take on roles educating children, so that, as Pratchett mentions in The Art of Discworld, she has "ended up, via that unconscious evolution that dogs characters, a kind of Goth Mary Poppins". Character Susan is the daughter of Ysabell, Death's adopted daughter, who is introduced in The Light Fantastic, and Mort, who was briefly Death's apprentice in the book Mort. At the end of Mort they leave Death's domain and become Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit, taking the motto Non Temetis Messor: "Don't Fear the Reaper." Susan is their only child.

John Duns Scotus  ( – 8 November 1308) was an important medieval philosopher and theologian who has been called the "father of modern philosophy". He is most famous for his work in the field of ontology, which sought to find a natural basis for the concepts of being, existence, and truth.  Duns Scotus was born at Duns Scotus Castle in what is now Ayrshire, Scotland. He attended the University of Paris, where he studied under William of Ockham. He then moved to Cologne, where he became a professor in 1295 and held this position until his death. He wrote prolifically on a wide range of subjects, including mathematics, physics, theology, and philosophy. He is best known for his work on the concept of universals, which sought to find a foundation for general knowledge.

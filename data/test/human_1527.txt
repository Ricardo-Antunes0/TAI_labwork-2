John Richardson Illingworth (26 June 1848 – 22 August 1915) was an English Anglican priest, philosopher, and theologian. He was a notable member of the set of liberal Anglo-Catholic theologians based in Oxford, and he contributed two chapters to the influential Lux Mundi. Early life and education Illingworth was born in London on 26 June 1848 to an Anglo-Catholic family, the second son of Edward Arthur Illingworth (1807–1883), chaplain to Middlesex House of Correction, and his wife, Mary Taylor. He was educated at St Paul's School, an all-boys public school in London. As a child, he worshipped at St Alban's Church, Holborn, and at All Saints, Margaret Street. He won both an exhibition and a scholarship to attend the University of Oxford. He then studied literae humaniores (classical studies) at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and achieved first-class honours in both mods and greats, graduating in 1871 with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree.

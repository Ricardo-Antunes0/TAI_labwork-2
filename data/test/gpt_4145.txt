Jean de Cointac, also Contat or Cointa, (1510 – 1586) was a French Roman Catholic bishop, diplomat and historian.  Cointac was born in Ivry-sur-Seine, the son of a tanner. After studying at the University of Paris, he was ordained a priest in 1539. He served as a papal nuncio to Germany (1550–1556), and then to England (1558–1559). On his return to France, he became bishop of Beauvais (1559–1586). He is best known as the author of "Histoire générale des croisades" (1572), which remains the standard work on the Crusades.  Cointac died in Beauvais.

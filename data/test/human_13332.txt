John Messinger (January 4, 1771 â€“ September 16, 1846) was an American pioneer, politician, teacher, and surveyor who was the first Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives. Born in Massachusetts, Messinger was educated in Vermont and married the daughter of Matthew Lyon. He left with Lyon to Kentucky, but disagreed with his stance on slavery and came to the Indiana Territory in 1802. He served in the Indiana Territorial Legislature and advocated for the creation of the Illinois Territory. When the state of Illinois was created in 1818, he co-authored its constitution and served in its first General Assembly as Speaker of the House. Messinger was also a prominent surveyor, establishing what is now the state line between Illinois and Wisconsin on behalf of the U.S. government. Biography John Messinger was born in West Stockbridge, Massachusetts, on January 4, 1771. In 1783, his family moved to Vermont. There, Messinger attained an education and showed skill with mathematics. He held a number of jobs in Vermont including carpenter, builder, teacher, mill-wright, and farmer. He married Anne Lyon, a daughter of Col. Matthew Lyon, a member of the United States House of Representatives. At the time, Lyon was being persecuted via the Alien and Sedition Acts so he decided to move, with Messinger, to Kentucky near the mouth of the Cumberland River. Lyon became a prosperous slave trader, but this irked anti-slavery Messinger and his brother-in-law George Cadwell. Cadwell and Messenger moved to the Indiana Territory in 1802, settling near New Design in what is now Monroe County, Illinois.

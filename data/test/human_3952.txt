Thanasis Bebis (; 26 June 1928 â€“ 23 July 2017) was a Greek footballer who played as a midfielder. He is deeply connected to Olympiacos, where he spent most of his career and won 24 titles. He made 17 appearances for the Greece national team scoring one goal. He was given the nickname "Pinocchio" as he deceived the opposite defences with his dribbling skills and moves with the ball. Club career Bebis was born on 26 June 1928 in Votanikos, and during the German occupation he started playing football in Prasina Poulia of Petralona. After a move to the neighboring teams Enosi Agiou Andrea and Akratitos, the young Athenian joined the roster of Fostiras at the age of 19. On 12 July 1948, he signed a letter stating: "I declare that I will be a loyal follower of him and I will never leave my favorite club Fostiras". Later, however, he accused the management of his team of forgery, revoked his declaration of allegiance and the case ended up in the courts without any outcome.

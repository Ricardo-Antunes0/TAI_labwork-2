The Providence Effect is a 2009 documentary film about the paranormal and the supernatural. It was directed by Terence M. Hughes and produced by Lawrence Bender.  The film is divided into three parts: "The Evidence", "The Search" and "The Conclusion".  "The Evidence" covers the history of the supernatural, from ancient times to the present day. It interviews historians, scientists, and spiritualists about their beliefs in ghosts, poltergeists, UFOs, and other unexplained phenomena.  "The Search" follows four people who believe they have been chosen to investigate paranormal phenomena: a skeptic documentary filmmaker; a woman whose husband claims to have been visited by an alien; a medium who claims to have contacted dead relatives; and a man whose daughter claims to have seen a ghost. The filmmakers follow each of these people as they attempt to contact supernatural beings and determine whether or not their experiences are real.  "The Conclusion" provides an overview of the history of the paranormal, as well as a verdict on the film's central question: Is there evidence that the supernatural exists?

Human communication, or anthroposemiotics, is the field of study that examines the meanings that humans communicate to one another. It encompasses both the linguistic aspects of communication, such as syntax and grammar, as well as the non-verbal communication of body language, facial expressions, and other vocal sounds.  Human communication is a fundamental part of human interaction, and is essential for the development of social bonds and relationships. It can also play a role in the exchange of information, emotions, and ideas. The study of human communication has applications in fields such as linguistics, sociology, psychology, and marketing.

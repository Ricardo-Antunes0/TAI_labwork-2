Jasper Hall Livingstone (March 23, 1815 – March 30, 1900) was an American horse owner, gentleman rider and sportsman. He was chargé d'affaires (Secretary of Legation) under Ambassador Washington Irving at Madrid and later the Master of the Pau Hounds for 12 non-consecutive winter seasons between 1847 and 1874. He was an innovator of drag hunting and mocked in the development of this "fictitious" sport (now widely practiced), while some considered it ideal for young riders or "the impatient and brave who hunted to ride rather than rode to hunt". Family Livingston was born on March 23, 1815 in Manhattan, New York City, as the youngest son of Henry Brockholst Livingston, Justice of the Supreme Court, and previously widowed Catherine (née Seaman) Kortright. His twin sister, Catherine Louisa Livingston, married Maurice Power, later a British MP and Lieutenant Governor of St. Lucia. Their paternal grandfather was William Livingston, the first governor of New Jersey and a Signer of the US Constitution. Their aunt, Sarah Livingston, was the wife of Founder, Statesman, New York Governor and Chief Justice John Jay.

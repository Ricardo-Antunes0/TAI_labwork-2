Regional Development Commissions are regional governments in the United States created by the National Development Act of 1965. Regional commissions were designed to help build consensus among disparate state and local governments about regional economic development policies and plans. Members of the commission are typically representatives from the governor's office, the legislature, business, labor, and education.  Regional commissions are authorized to provide financial and technical assistance to local governments in their regions for economic development projects. They also have a role in promoting coordination among state and local governments in their region. Regional commissions are funded through a combination of federal, state, and local funds.

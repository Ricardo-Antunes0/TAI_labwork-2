NGC 4452 is an edge-on lenticular galaxy located in the constellation Canes Venatici. It was discovered on October 4, 1784 by William Herschel.  NGC 4452 is a peculiar galaxy because it has a pronounced ring structure. This ring is about 100,000 light years wide and is oriented perpendicular to the galaxy's main body. The ring is thought to be caused by the interaction of the galaxy with other galaxies. NGC 4452 also has a large central bulge, which is likely the result of a recent collision with another galaxy.  NGC 4452 is one of the brightest galaxies in the sky, and can be seen with the naked eye. It is also one of the most distant galaxies known, being some 50 million light years from Earth.

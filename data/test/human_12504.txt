A sewing machine needle is a specialized needle for use in a sewing machine.  A sewing machine needle consists of:  shank - clamped by the sewing machine's needle holder  shoulder - where the thick shank tapers down to the shaft  shaft - a length suitable for driving the eye and thread through the material and down to the bobbin  groove - cut in the front of the shaft to allow the thread to lie more closely to the needle as it passes through the fabric  scarf - provides extra room for the hook or shuttle to pass close by  eye - carries the thread  point - penetrates the material by either parting the threads or cutting a hole in the fabric Domestic sewing machines, designed for use in homes as opposed to commercial sewing operations, use a common needle type (including a standardized length, as well as shank shape and diameter) referred to as "Groz-Beckert 130 / 705," "HAx1" or "15x1" needles. Needles labeled as "universal" needles are of this type and are generally the type of needles found in retail sewing supply shops. The 15x1 needle is available in different standardized shaft diameters suitable for sewing different fabrics (see the section on Size codes below).

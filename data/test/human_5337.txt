Joseph Gurwin (June 13, 1920 â€“ September 24, 2009) was a Lithuanian-born American textile executive who became a philanthropist who contributed to Jewish causes in the United States and Israel. Gurwin arrived in the U.S. with little in his pocket, built his fortune manufacturing specialized textiles for the United States armed forces, gave much of his money to charity and then lost significant sums that had been invested with Bernard Madoff. Early life Born Joseph Gurwich in a Lithuanian Jewish family in Kovno, Lithuania on June 13, 1920, he immigrated to the United States in 1934 to avoid the prospect of being forced to repeat a grade after failing both Latin and Lithuanian language, having focused more on soccer than on his schoolwork. His family remained in Lithuania and both of his parents were killed in the Holocaust. His younger brother, Chaim, was the family's lone survivor, but he was caught behind the Iron Curtain after the end of World War II, and the two did not meet for 52 years until they were reunited in Tel Aviv in 1988. He served in the United States Army during World War II.

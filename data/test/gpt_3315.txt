Rosh HaShanah (, , lit. "start of the year") is the Jewish new year. It falls on the first day of Tishrei, the ninth month of the Hebrew calendar.  Rosh Hashanah typically marks the end of the High Holy Days and the beginning of the Jewish New Year. On Rosh Hashanah, Jews commemorate the revelation of God's will to Moses on Mount Sinai and celebrate God's covenant with the people.

Multiple treatments, like multivalued treatments, generalize the principle of multiple treatments to many different objects, each with its own set of properties. Multiple treatments may be used to describe any situation where several objects share at least one property, or where each object has a unique set of properties.  Multiple treatments have been used in research and medicine for many years. They are particularly useful in situations where it is difficult to study individual objects or where it is necessary to study several objects simultaneously.

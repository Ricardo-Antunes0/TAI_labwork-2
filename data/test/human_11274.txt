After losing its political identity completely in 1568 following the defeat and demise of the last king Mukunda Dev, efforts resulted in the formation of a politically separate state under British rule on a linguistic basis on 1 April 1936. State history The main revolution in this separate state continued for three decades from the very day of formation of Utkal Sammilani that led to the foundation of a separate Odisha Province.

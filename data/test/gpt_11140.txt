Radioactive decay (also known as nuclear decay, nuclear fission, or nuclear fusion) is the process by which an unstable nucleus (uranium, plutonium, etc.) breaks down into smaller nuclei and particles.  Radioactivity is the property of atoms that makes them emit radiation when they are bombarded with energetic particles from the outside. This radiation can be measured in units called roentgens (R), where one roentgen is the amount of radiation that produces an effect on the human body equal to that of 1 joule of energy delivered by a powerful lightbulb.  The two processes that result in radioactivity are spontaneous fission and alpha decay. In spontaneous fission, a nucleus breaks apart into two or more smaller nuclei. In alpha decay, a nucleus breaks down into an electron and a proton, both of which are stable.

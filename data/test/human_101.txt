Julius Sello Malema (born 3 March 1981) is a South African politician and activist who is a Member of Parliament and the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Economic Freedom Fighters, a South African political party, which he founded in July 2013. He previously served as President of the African National Congress Youth League from 2008 to 2012. Julius Malema was also a member of the African National Congress (ANC) from the age of nine until his expulsion from the party in April 2012 at the age of thirty-one. Julius rose to prominence as a supporter of ANC president, and later President of South Africa, Jacob Zuma. He was described by both Zuma and the Premier of Limpopo Province, Cassel Mathale, as the "future leader" of South Africa. Less favourable portraits paint him as a "reckless populist" with the potential to destabilise South Africa and to spark racial conflict. Malema was convicted of hate speech in March 2010 and again in September 2011. In November 2011, he was suspended from the ANC for five years for sowing divisions within the party. In 2011, he was again convicted of hate speech after singing "Dubul' ibhunu" ("Shoot the Boer"), a decision upheld on appeal, leading to his expulsion from the ANC.

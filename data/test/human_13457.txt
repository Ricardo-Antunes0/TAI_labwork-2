The 2019 All Out was the inaugural All Out professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It took place during Labor Day weekend on August 31, 2019, at the Sears Centre Arena in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, Illinois. The event is considered the sequel to the independently produced All In PPV held in September 2018 at the same venue, which was the catalyst to the formation of AEW. Ten matches were contested at the event, including two on the pre-show. In the main event, Chris Jericho defeated Adam Page to become the inaugural AEW World Champion. In other prominent matches, the Lucha Brothers (Pentagón Jr. and Rey Fénix) defeated The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) in a ladder match to retain the AAA World Tag Team Championship, Cody defeated Shawn Spears, and Pac defeated Kenny Omega by referee stoppage. The AEW Women's World Championship belt was also unveiled with Nyla Rose and Riho winning their respective matches to face each other for the inaugural championship on the premiere episode of Dynamite on October 2, 2019.

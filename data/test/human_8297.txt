The Helles clan is a Palestinian extended family that became known in 2008 for its violent conflict with the de facto Hamas military government in the Gaza Strip. It is politically aligned with the Fatah party, which controls the politics of the West Bank, and became a suspected key player in the July 26, 2008 bus bombing in Gaza City which killed five members of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas. Fight against Hamas and Flight to Israel  On August 2, Hamas retaliated against the Hilles clan by raiding the predominantly Hilles neighborhood of Sajaiyeh in Gaza City; around nine people were killed in the ensuing gunfight and around 90 were injured. In the evening hours, the leader's brother of the clan (and former leader of the Tanzim faction of Fatah), Ahmed Hilles, led around 188 members of the clan to Nahal Oz and two other border crossings between Gaza and Israel, where they laid down their weapons and were stripsearched by Israeli troops before they were allowed onto Israeli soil; many of the wounded who fled to the border crossing, including Ahmed Hilles, were admitted to hospitals. Four were admitted to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba for heavier injuries, while eleven others were admitted to Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon with lighter injuries.

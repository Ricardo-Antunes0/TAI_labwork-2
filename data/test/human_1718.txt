The Osmund Osmundson House is a historic house in Nerstrand, Minnesota, United States.  The private home was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on April 6, 1982. The house is significant for its association with a prominent Rice County pioneer and town founder. Structure The Osmund Osmundson House is located in the northeast of the small town of Nerstrand, east of what were the rails for the Chicago Great Western Railway, since removed.  The white, two-story gabled brick house was completed in 1880.  The sprawling structure consists of two sections: each with an intersecting gable roof with wooden shingles.  The south section, the left section of the front facade, is two bays by two bays and has portions that date to 1856.  The north section measures three bays by two bays with a -story extension added to the rear (western) facade.  Two over two windows are regularly spaced and slightly arched.  The structure has two porches: an enclosed porch topped by a balcony on the rear (northwestern) corner as well as a modified front porch across the front section's three bays facade.  The building originally had an elaborate balustraded full front porch and a red brick color.

Blasco I Alagona or d'Alagona (died 1301), called the Elder, was an Aragonese nobleman and soldier in the service of the Kingdom of Sicily after 1285. His family was originally from Alag√≥n. As a military commander, he was noted for his adept use of mobile infantry against heavy cavalry. Blasco was born in the first half of the 13th century. He probably served Peter III of Aragon (died 1285) in the conquest of Sicily (1282), since he was already established there in November 1285, when he witnessed the sale by Peter's heir, Alfonso III, of his right to Sicily to his brother James. He was entrusted with important military and administrative tasks by James. In 1291, he captured Montalto in Calabria and made its Neapolitan commander, Guidone da Primerano, a prisoner. At the end of the year, he was summoned to Aragon by James, who had succeeded Alfonso in the interim, to answer charges of embezzlement. He returned to Sicily and was preparing another campaign when he was recalled a second time to Aragon in 1294. When James renounced his claim on Sicily in the Treaty of Anagni the following year (1295), Blasco left his court without permission and returned to Sicily.

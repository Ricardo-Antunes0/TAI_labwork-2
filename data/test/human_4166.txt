Bots!! is a massively multiplayer online game (MMO) created by Acclaim Games as the company's launch title and most popular game, with the theme of robots fighting against computer viruses. Players choose from one of three basic BOTS and level up their character through gameplay and buying items with virtual credits called gigas. Three game modes exist for the game: Sector Battle, Player versus Player, and Base Battle. A Korean version of the game, called BOUT!! (Bots Of Unlimited Transformation), also existed and was nearly identical, but received new updates earlier than the American version. BOUT!! was intended to be originally released on Xbox, but ended up being solely released on PC. Beta testing for BOTS!! began in March 2006  before being released in November 2006. The online servers were shut down on August 27, 2010 following the purchase of Acclaim Games by Playdom and Disney's purchasing of Playdom for $763 million.

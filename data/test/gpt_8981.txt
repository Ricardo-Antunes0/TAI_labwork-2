Hunter v Moss [1994] 1 WLR 452 is a case in English law, decided by the Court of Appeal on 21 October 1994. The appellant, Hunter, was charged with shooting and killing the respondent, Moss, at a public place. Hunter defended the action on the grounds that he had been acting in self-defence. The court held that he was not guilty of murder because he had acted in self-defence and was therefore not guilty of an unlawful killing.  The case has been cited as an example of a situation where someone may act in self-defence and still be found guilty of murder.

Metropolis at Metrotown (commonly referred to as Metropolis) is an urban shopping mall located in Metro Vancouver, Canada. It is the largest shopping mall in British Columbia and the third largest shopping mall in Canada, behind Toronto's Eaton Centre and Montreal's Place des Arts.  Metropolis at Metrotown was built on the former site of the Vancouver Exhibition and Convention Centre (VEC), which opened in 1958 as the first purpose-built exhibition hall in Canada. The mall opened on October 17, 1986, and was owned by Westfield Corporation until it was sold to Cedar Fair Entertainment Company (CFEC) in August 2004. CFEC announced that it would be closing Metropolis at Metrotown on September 3, 2006, citing continuing economic conditions and high competition from other regional malls. However, due to a public outcry, Cedar Fair announced that it would keep the mall open until at least 2008.  On October 10, 2007, it was announced that Metropolis at Metrotown had been sold to Canadian developer Ivanhoé Cambridge for $425 million CAD. Ivanhoé Cambridge plans to redevelop the mall into a mixed-use development including a new flagship store for luxury chain Saks Fifth Avenue. The redevelopment is expected to begin in 2008 and be completed by 2012. As of January 2009, only one store has been relocated from Metropolis at Metrotown to another location; other major tenants have left or are in the process of leaving the mall.

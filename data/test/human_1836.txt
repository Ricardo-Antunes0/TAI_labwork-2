His retired and irresponsible father (Delhi Ganesh) is more interested in playing cards than looking for grooms for his two unmarried daughters. Circumstances force Madhavan to marry Abhirami (Abhirami), even before his sisters are wed, a situation quite unthinkable in middle-class homes and the couple unable to have their first night and desperate for it. Meanwhile, Madhavan's sisters find their match in an auto driver named Kuzhandaivelu (Vadivelu) and an unemployed man named Manimaran (Vivek), who claims to have a royal background. Madhavan then conducts the weddings of both his sisters, but in the struggle to keep the rest of his family happy, he and Abirami are unable to enjoy even the basic pleasures of married life. How they unite with each other, have they finally celebrated their first night? and convince their family about it (sometimes with comical results) forms the rest of the story.

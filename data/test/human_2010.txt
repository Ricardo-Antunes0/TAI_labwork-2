Byron Wallen (born July 1969) is a British jazz trumpeter, composer and educator. He was described by Jazzwise as "one of the most innovative, exciting and original trumpet players alive". As characterised by All About Jazz, "He does not fit into any pigeonhole, however, and is also something of a renaissance man: he has long been involved in cognitive psychology and also travels widely, spending extended periods in South Africa, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Morocco, Indonesia and Belize (his parents' homeland)." Biography Wallen was born in London, England, to parents from Belize, and was brought up in a musical family â€“ one of his three siblings is composer Errollyn Wallen. After beginning to learn classical piano as a young child, also playing euphonium, he went on to study the trumpet in New York in the mid- to late 1980s with Jimmy Owens, Donald Byrd and Jon Faddis. Wallen graduated from Sussex University with a degree in Psychology, Philosophy and Maths, while developing his music career, recording with Loose Ends and Cleveland Watkiss, and playing trumpet with The Style Council, Charles Earland, Courtney Pine and Jean Toussaint, among others. He is also among the alumni of jazz music education and artist development organisation Tomorrow's Warriors. Other artists with whom he would later perform include David Murray, Andrew Hill, Butch Morris, Billy Higgins, Hugh Masekela, Manu Dibango, Eddie Henderson, Wynton Marsalis, George Benson, William Orbit, Toumani Diabate, Ronnie Laws, Chaka Khan and Grand Union Orchestra.

Katya Alpert Gilden (March 9, 1914 – May 5, 1991) was an American best-selling novelist who wrote with her husband Bert Gilden under the pen-name "K.B. Gilden". The couple produced two major novels, Hurry Sundown (1964), which was made into an Otto Preminger film of the same title in 1967, and Between the Hills and the Sea (1971), published four months after Bert's death. Biography Gilden was born in Bangor, Maine and graduated from Radcliffe College in 1935. While an undergraduate, she was the first woman to publish in the Harvard Advocate, submitting a poem, and a story about a fight between a black and a white boxer. The themes of race, gender, and inequality would resurface in her two novels. Hurry Sundown is about black and white Southern sharecroppers, and Between the Hills and the Sea about factory workers and labor relations in the 1940s and 1950s. The Gildens considered themselves "novelist[s] of the world of work", and were heavily influenced by essays on proletarian fiction by György Lukács.

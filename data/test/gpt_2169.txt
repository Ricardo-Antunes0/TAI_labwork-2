The Joan Gamper Trophy  or Joan Gamper Trophy for Women's Football is a international club football award given annually to the best women's football player of the year. The trophy is named after Joan Gamper, who was the first woman to chair a FIFA committee and was also a key figure in the establishment of women's football as an official sport at the Olympic Games.  The trophy was first awarded in 1989, and was created in memory of Joan Gamper, who had died in 1988. Initially, it was only awarded to players from UEFA member clubs, but since 2003 it has been open to players from all over the world. The winner is selected by a voting panel, which includes representatives from the European Club Association and FIFA. The current holder is Pernille Harder of Denmark, who won the award in 2018.

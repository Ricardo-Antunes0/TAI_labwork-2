Buga-shadara, also known as Bouge Shodre, is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Tuva, a republic in Siberia, Russia. It is a hunt game where one player plays the deers (which is "buga" in the Tuva language). There are two deers usually represented as the black pieces.  The boars are also referred black in the referenced article "Buga-shadara a folk game from Tuva".  The other player has 24 white pieces with dogs associated to them.  The board consist of an Alquerque board flanked on two of its opposite sides by a square patterned board (referred to as "side-houses" in the referenced article).  Because the board is in part an Alquerque board, this makes Buga-shadara a tiger hunt game (or tiger game).  What makes Buga-shadara unique among tiger games are the expansion boards on the two opposite sides of the Alquerque board.  They are square, whereas most are triangle-like.  The word "shadara" resembles the word "shahdara".  The "shah" part "is a title given to the emperors/kings and lords of Iran (historically also known as Persia).".  There is a place called Shahdara Bagh in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan, and it's thought that the word "Shahdara can be translated as "the way of kings". Shah translates as "king" and dara translates as the way of kings."  The referenced article associates the boars (the two black pieces) as kings.  Perhaps the boars or deers are kings, and have to find a way or have a way with the white pieces or dogs. A variant of the game allows for White to move one of its pieces immediately after it drops a piece in the beginning portion of the game.

The Ball brothers (Lucius, William, Edmund, Frank, and Albert) were a wealthy and influential family of American merchants, bankers and political leaders in the first half of the 20th century. They are most famous for their business dealings with the Soviet Union and their efforts to prevent World War II.  The Ball brothers were born to a wealthy family in Wheeling, West Virginia, on November 13, 1881. The family had roots in Virginia and West Virginia dating back to the early 1800s. In 1892, the Ball brothers moved to New York City, where they started their own business selling coal. The brothers soon began investing in other businesses, and by 1912 they had established themselves as one of the leading coal merchants in the United States.  In 1929, the Ball brothers began investing in Soviet Union mining projects. This move would become one of their most significant business endeavors, as the brothers soon became one of the wealthiest families in America due to their investments in Soviet Union mining companies. The Ball brothers were instrumental in helping to prevent World War II from happening by convincing the Soviet Union not to attack America during the early stages of the war.  The Ball brothers died on November 13, 1966. They are buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Wheeling, West Virginia.

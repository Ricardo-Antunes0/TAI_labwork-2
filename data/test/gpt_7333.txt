In computing,  10-foot user interface ("10-foot UI") is a user interface design paradigm and term used to describe the use of a single screen that spans the width of a person's waist, or a 10-foot distance.  The term was first used in the 1980s by Xerox PARC to describe their graphical user interface design philosophy. The use of a single screen that spans the width of a person's waist allowed for faster and more fluid interaction with the computer. This design approach has since been adopted by other companies and is now considered standard in modern computer interfaces.

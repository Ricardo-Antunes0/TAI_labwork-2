Bodin Church  is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Bodø Municipality in Nordland county, Norway.  It is located in the southeastern part of the town of Bodø. It is one of the churches for the Bodin parish which is part of the Bodø domprosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Sør-Hålogaland. The white, stone church was built in a long church style around the year 1240 using plans drawn up by an unknown architect. The church seats about 300 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1321, but the church was likely built around the year 1240. The stone building had a rectangular nave with a narrower, nearly square chancel with a lower roof line. In 1785, a transept was built on the south side of the nave to enlarge the building and it now seats about 300 people. In 1894, the entire old portion of the medieval church was torn down and rebuilt in the same style.

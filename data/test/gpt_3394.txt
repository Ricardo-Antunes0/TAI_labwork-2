Catharine Flood McCall (1766–March 9, 1828) was an American educator and founder of the Female seminary of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.  Born in Wilmington, Delaware, McCall was one of thirteen children of Major General James Flood and Anne (née Moore) Flood. Her father was a Revolutionary War officer who served as adjutant general of Delaware and then as governor. McCall was educated in Philadelphia and at the Female seminary of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, founded by her brother, the Rev. John Flood, in 1802. She became its first president in 1815.  McCall's work as an educator focused on girls, and she is credited with helping to raise the status of women within the Presbyterian Church. She also served as president of several other organizations, including the American Bible Society (1814–15) and the American Temperance Union (1827–28). McCall died in Philadelphia at the age of seventy-eight.

Major Barbara is a three-act English play written by Christopher Fry and first produced in 1955. The play is set during World War II, and revolves around the relationship between an Englishwoman, Barbara, and a German officer, Hans.  Major Barbara is often considered one of Fry's finest works, and has been frequently produced on stage and television. It has been cited as an influence on many subsequent works of British theatre.  The play is divided into three parts: "Part One", "Part Two", and "Part Three". Part One tells the story of Barbara's courtship and marriage to Hans, while Part Two centres around Hans's return to Germany and their struggles to escape the country during the war. Part Three sees Hans return to England and Barbara's eventual realization that he is not really returning to her, but to his own life.

Herman Witte (7 December 1666 — 24 January 1736) was a Dutch theologian and bishop in the Church of the Netherlands.  Born in The Hague, Witte was educated at the University of Leiden and at the University of Paris. He became a professor at the University of Utrecht in 1695 and dean of its faculty of theology in 1700. He was elected bishop of Haarlem-Amsterdam in 1711, serving until his death.  Witte was a prolific writer, producing an estimated 1,500 works on theology, ecclesiastical history, dogmatics, and poetry. He is especially remembered for his encyclopedic work "Lexicon Theologiae Christianae" (1710–17), which remains the most comprehensive theological lexicon ever published.

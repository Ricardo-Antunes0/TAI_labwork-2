The Paps of Anu (, "the breasts of Anu") are a pair of large, pendulous breasts which are venerated in Mesopotamian religion and mythology.  The Paps of Anu are mentioned in the Babylonian creation epic Enuma Elish, where they are the breasts of the goddess Inanna. Inanna bathes in the river Nisin and her bathwater creates two mud monsters, Ziz and Zagzag. The Paps of Anu grow from the monsters' navels, and so Inanna is able to capture them and bring them to her palace.  The Paps of Anu are also mentioned in the Gilgamesh epic, where Gilgamesh visits the city of Uruk and encounters the goddess Aruru. Aruru offers Gilgamesh a drink from her sacred spring, and when he takes a sip he is overcome by desire for her. Gilgamesh asks Aruru to show him her breasts, and after she complies he marries her.

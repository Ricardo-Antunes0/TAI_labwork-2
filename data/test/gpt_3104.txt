Equivalence is a term applied by the trade theorists to describe the principle that the value of two goods is the same if they are exchanged in an exchange transaction. The theory asserts that two goods are equivalent if their use in a particular economic situation produces the same result.  Equivalence has been used as a basis for trade policy and international trade negotiations. Countries may use equivalence to determine whether imported goods are subject to taxes or tariffs, or to determine whether exported goods are subject to subsidies. Equivalence is also a key criterion for determining whether products from different countries can be classified as identical under the GATT 1994 treaty.  The theory of equivalence was first proposed by the Italian economist Jacopo Niccol√≤ Vico in his treatise "The New Science" (1725). In this work, Vico argued that all objects in the world were equivalents, and that humans could understand the world by understanding its equivalents.

Oph 162225-240515, often abbreviated Oph 1622, and also known as Oph 11, is a pair of brown dwarfs that have been reported as orbiting each other. The bodies are located in the constellation Scorpius and are about 400 light years away. Mass estimates of the two objects are uncertain, but they are probably each higher than the brown-dwarf/planet dividing line of 13 Jupiter masses. Oph1622B is located 1.94 arcseconds from Oph1622A, at a position angle of 182°. The discovery of the pair was announced in a 2006 Science article by Ray Jayawardhana and  Valentin D. Ivanov . The objects were discovered using telescopes of the European Southern Observatory's New Technology Telescope in La Silla, Chile. The masses were originally reported to be lower, at 14 and 7 Jupiter masses, which would have made the smaller object a planetary-mass object, or planemo. The system was announced as the first reported binary system of objects this small. However, later observations and calculations have revised the masses upward. Close et al. estimate the mass of the primary, designated Oph1622A as 12–21 times that of Jupiter and 9–20 Jupiter masses for the less massive Oph1622B, while Luhman et al.

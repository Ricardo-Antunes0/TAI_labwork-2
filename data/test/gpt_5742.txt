In political science, a multi-party system is a political system in which more than two political parties are present in the same country or region. The multiple parties allow for a more competitive and diverse election process, as well as the possibility of coalition governments.  A multi-party system is not always present in countries around the world. Only a handful of countries have a two-party system, while most have some form of multi-party system. The United States is an example of a country with a two-party system. In other countries, there are several major political parties, and it can be difficult to tell how many parties are present in a given area.  Multi-party systems can lead to more stable governments, as the various parties can negotiate and compromise with each other. This is often preferable to having one party in control of the government, as this party may be less willing to compromise on important issues. Additionally, multi-party systems can lead to more diverse legislative bodies, as there is more competition for seats.

Factorydale is a community in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. The economy is based on a pulp and paper mill, a cannery and a tourist industry. The community has a population of 1,000.  Factorydale is located in the Annapolis Valley about northwest of the provincial capital of Halifax. The community is bordered to the north by the town of Wolfville, to the east by the town of Liverpool and to the south by the town of Yarmouth.  The community was first settled in 1851 by John Brown, who established a sawmill. The mill was later purchased by the Pearsons, who expanded it into a pulp and paper factory. The mill closed in 2002, leading to the decline of the community. In response, the town began marketing itself as a tourist destination, with restaurants, bed and breakfasts and other businesses catering to visitors.   Factorydale was also home to Canada's first paper-making machine, which was donated by Sir John A. Macdonald in 1895.

The sai (Japanese: 釵, lit. 'Hairpin'; Chinese: 弓, pinyin: yáo) is a type of short, straight-bladed samurai sword. It is characterized by a single-edged blade with a curved cutting edge and a handle that is shaped like an S-curve. The sai was primarily used as an stabbing weapon, but could also be used as a slashing or hacking weapon.

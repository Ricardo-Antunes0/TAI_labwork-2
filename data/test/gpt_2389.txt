Recreational Football (also known as Rec Footy, Touch Footy or Mini Football) is a sport played by teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is considered to be a form of football and is popular in many parts of the world.  The game is played on a rectangular field with two goals at each end. The object of the game is to score by kicking or running the ball into the opposing goal. There are several variations of the game, including but not limited to American football, Australian rules football, Gaelic football, rugby union, and soccer.  Recreational football can be traced back to at least 1869 when two students at McGill University in Montreal, Canada played a game of football. The first recorded association football match took place in England in 1872. However, it was not until 1880 that rules for the game were codified and standardized. The first international match was played in 1892 between Scotland and England.

A left-handed batsman and occasional right-arm offbreak bowler, he played Tests and One Day Internationals for Australia from 1970 to 1985. He was an integral part of the Australian team that won the 1983 World Cup, and also captained the side in the 1987 and 1991 World Cups.  Lawry was named Australian Cricketer of the Year in 1973, 1984 and 1985. He was also named captain of the Australian cricket team for a record fourth time in 1988â€“89. His Test batting average of 54.02 is the highest among Australians with at least 1000 innings. He holds the record for most Test matches played by an Australian (62), as well as the record for most Tests as captain (27).  He retired from all forms of cricket in November 1995, after playing his last One Day International against Sri Lanka at Perth. Lawry has since been involved in commentary and coaching, most notably with Cricket Australia.

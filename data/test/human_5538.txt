"Princess Yunluo"  is a short story by Pu Songling, first published in Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio (1740). The story follows the misadventures of An Daye — after the titular princess enters his life — and subsequently those of his two sons. Plot Lulong native An Daye  is born with the ability to speak, although he soon loses it after his mother feeds him dog's blood. An grows up to become an eligible bachelor and his mother receives a revelation in her dreams that he will marry a princess. One day, a divine princess by the name of Yunluo appears in An's bedroom along with her housemaid, who announces that the king has decreed that An will be his son-in-law. The princess proceeds to play a game of weiqi with An; she wins in just thirty moves. They begin a second game, wherein An is offered a handicap of six black stones. After An blunders, the princess offers him a thousand taels to refurbish his house before she moves in, although her housemaid adds that he should only do so the following month. Princess Yunluo then signals that she is leaving, and An unsuccessfully attempts to stop her from doing so.

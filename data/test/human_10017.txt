OpiumRoz (, translated: Opium of Roses) is the debut studio album of Russian girlband Serebro. It was released 25 April 2009 by Monolit Records in Russia, and 2 March 2010 by Symbolic Records. It was produced by Maxim Fadeev and some of Serebro themselves. The album originally had a projected release date of 17 October 2008 but due to problems with the track list the release had been delayed. The album was later released April 25, 2009 in their native Russia. The album was later released through iTunes worldwide by the Finnish record label Symbolic Records. Both versions of the album feature 11 tracks in total and include their debut single and Eurovision Song Contest 2007 entry "Song #1". Marina Lizorkina's vocals feature on both versions, though she left group in June 2009 (before the international release). It didn't chart in any major album charts. The album received critical acclaim from critics, calling it an amazing taste of music genres of Pop, Rock and Electro, but had less commercial success.  The album was recorded in Moscow, Russia by their management group Monolit Records.

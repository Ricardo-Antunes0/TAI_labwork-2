The Crosman model 1377 (also known as the "American Classic") is a single-shot, bolt-action, pneumatic .177 caliber pellet gun, featuring a rifled steel barrel and imitation wood checkered plastic grips. The 1377 was introduced in 1977, and has been in continuous production ever since.  A separately available shoulder stock (which Crosman designates model 1399) converts the rather long pistol into a carbine. The 1377 is not a competition level target airgun, but its long rifled barrel makes it fairly accurate. Atypical for modern pneumatic air pistols (which are mostly charged with a single action of a lever-action pump), the 1377 can be pumped to various levels; Crosman recommends at least three pumps to ensure that the pellet clears the barrel, but as many as ten pumps are advised by the manual. Crosman claims a pellet velocity of up to  from a gun pumped ten times, which is higher than that achieved by most pellet pistols of any kind. Many 1377 owners report success with only a few pumps, and the lower velocity is accompanied by lower noise, often an advantage for those shooting indoors.

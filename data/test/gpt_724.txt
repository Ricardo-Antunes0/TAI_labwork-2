On 6 June 1994, two Japanese tourists, Nobuyuki Uematsu and Emiko Kato, were killed at the Oriental Hotel in Brisbane, Australia.   The perpetrator of the murders was hotel security guard Neil James DeWalt, who had been working at the hotel for less than a month. DeWalt was found guilty of the murders and sentenced to life imprisonment.

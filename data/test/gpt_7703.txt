The Magic Garden is the second album by the British pop duo Simon and Garfunkel, released on Columbia Records in October 1966. Recorded in just 14 days, the album was rushed into production to capitalise on the duo's recent success with their previous album, The Sound of Silence.  The album yielded two hit singles, "The Sound of Silence" and "The Boxer". However, critical reception was mixed and the album failed to chart on the Billboard 200. The Magic Garden has since been cited as a key influence on later singer-songwriters such as Neil Young and Joni Mitchell.  In 2003, The Magic Garden was reissued on CD and vinyl by Sony Music Entertainment with bonus tracks including alternate takes of both "The Sound of Silence" and "The Boxer".

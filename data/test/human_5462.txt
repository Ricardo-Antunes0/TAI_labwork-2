Stanislav Volodymyrovych Aseyev (, also Stanyslav Asieiev, Stanislav Vasin ; born October 1, 1989) is a Ukrainian writer and journalist. His best known work is the novel The Melchior Elephant (2016). In May 2014 his native city of Donetsk fell under control of pro-Russian militants and he remained there. During the period of 2015–2017 Aseyev was publishing his reports (writing under the pen name Stanislav Vasin) for Mirror Weekly newspaper and other Ukrainian media, before 2 June 2017, when he disappeared. On 16 July, an agent of the DNR's “Ministry of State Security” confirmed that he was kidnapped by militants from so-called Donetsk People's Republic. Amnesty International, Committee to Protect Journalists, the European Federation of Journalists, Human Rights Watch, the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, PEN International, Reporters Without Borders and the United States Mission to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have called for his immediate release. The US Senators Bob Menendez and Marco Rubio have also voiced their support for Aseyev. Despite huge international support Aseyev was sentenced for 15 years and spent 962 days in Izolyatsia prison. He was released as part of a prison exchange and handed over to Ukrainian authorities on 29 December 2019.

Sungaya is a monotypic genus of stick insects, containing the species Sungaya inexpectata. Its common name is the sunny stick insect, derived from the less commonly used sungay stick insect. The genus name refers to the locality of the holotype, i.e. the region where the insect was first collected. The species name is derived from the Latin as "inexpectatus" and means "unexpected". Discovery and occurrence  Oliver Zompro collected the first specimen of this species, a nymph, on 8 September 1995 near Mount Sungay in the province of Batangas-associated township Talisayon on the Philippine island of Luzon. She died a short time later due to a failed molting during transport. On October 7, 1995, he was almost at the same location where he collected an adult female. Zompro discovered more females in 1999 near the Taal Lake on ferns. The first males were discovered in 2008 by Orlando L. Eusebio, S. A. Yap and A. R. Larona, also on Luzon, more precisely at Mount Cayapo of the Mariveles Mountains in Baranggay Alangan in of the province of Bataan in the associated township Limay.

Pioneers' Day or Pioneer Day was a public holiday in Rhodesia. The day was created to commemorate the Pioneer Column led by Cecil Rhodes and the British South Africa Company on 12 September 1890. It was originally called Occupation Day when established in 1920 but was renamed as Pioneers' Day in 1961. The day was abolished as a public holiday following Rhodesia becoming Zimbabwe in 1980. Background  The Pioneer Column was part of a plan by Rhodes and the BSAC to settle the Mashonaland. On 12 September 1890, the settlers raised the Union Jack over Fort Salisbury (later shortened to Salisbury) to announce the start of Company rule in Rhodesia. The day was formulated as a public holiday in 1920 under the Bank Holiday Amendment Ordinance as Occupation Day where it was intended to replace Shangani Day. In 1961, it was renamed as Pioneers' Day. The commemoration continued during Rhodesia's unrecognised unilateral independence but following the establishment of Zimbabwe, as part of a Robert Mugabe led campaign to Africanise the country, the holiday was abolished.

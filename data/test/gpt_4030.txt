The Wang Jingwei regime is the common name given to the Japanese-backed puppet regime in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. It was named after Wang Jingwei, the leader of the regime.  The Wang Jingwei regime was established in September 1938, following the defeat of the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) by Japan in the Battle of Shanghai. The regime was led by Wang Jingwei, who had formerly been a KMT general. The Japanese occupation of China allowed the Wang Jingwei regime to operate relatively unimpeded, although it was not a completely independent entity. In 1941, Wang Jingwei joined Japan's Tripartite Pact with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. This led to increased Japanese involvement in his regime, and by 1943, he had become Japan's deputy supreme commander in China. In 1944, he was made commander-in-chief of all Japanese forces in China.  The Wang Jingwei regime fell to the communist Peoples Liberation Army in 1945.

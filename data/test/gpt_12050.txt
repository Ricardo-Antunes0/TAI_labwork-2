The history of Baltic Basketball League goes back to 2001 when it was founded as the Baltic Basketball Cup. In 2003, it was renamed to Baltic Basketball League and in 2007 it got its current name.   The BBL was founded as an amateur regional league with ten teams. In 2007, the first professional season took place and the winner of the regular season was promoted to the EuroCup. In 2013, the BBL merged with two other regional leagues making it a ten-team league. From 2018 onwards, the BBL will have a regular season with 16 teams and playoffs with 4 teams.

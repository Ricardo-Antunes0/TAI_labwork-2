After Swing Mob Swing Mob folded in 1995, with a variety of reasons being attributed. According to Smoke E. Digglera of Playa, the artists were forced to choose whether they wanted to be signed directly to Def Jam or through Swing Mob, causing a question of loyalty to arise amongst members. After Swing Mob folded, the artists continued to collaborate and brought new members in, such as  Skillz and Nicole Wray later on.

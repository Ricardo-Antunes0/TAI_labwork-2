The Letra del año (Spanish) or Letra de Oro (English) is an annual award given by the Spanish music radio station Cadena Ser to the best song performed in Spain during the previous year.  The Letra del año is one of Spain's most prestigious music awards. The first Letra del año was awarded in 1978 to the song "Ayer" performed by Agustín Lara.   Since its inception, the Letra del año has been given annually to the best song performed in Spain. The eligibility period for nominations is typically from mid-January to mid-December of the previous year. The voting process is conducted by members of Cadena Ser's staff and audience.   The Letra del Año trophy is a statuette of a golden singer wearing a crown, with a laurel wreath in its hand.

Bodenseesender  was a radio transmission facility located in the Bodensee valley in Switzerland. The station was operated by the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SBC) from 1963 until its closure in 2003.  The Bodenseesender was the first radio transmission facility in Switzerland to be built for the purpose of providing emergency communication should Switzerland be invaded. The station was also used for weather forecasting and for transmitting music and other programmes to the Swiss population.  The Bodenseesender closed down in 2003 due to budget cuts by the SBC.

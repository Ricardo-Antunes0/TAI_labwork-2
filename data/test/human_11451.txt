Between 1928 and 1952 the Bucketts Way served as the alignment of the Pacific Highway between Raymond Terrace and Taree. The entire route is designated as Tourist Drive TD2. Route In the south, the Bucketts Way branches off to the west of the Pacific Highway  north of the Raymond Terrace bypass. Heading north, it crosses the Karuah River about  south of Stroud and then roughly follows the course of the Karuah River upstream in a west-north-westerly direction for approximately , crossing the Mammy Johnsons River. It then turns north-north-east and then north for  until it reaches Gloucester, crossing the Avon River on the way. The North Coast Railway line runs parallel with it from just north-east of Stroud Road to Gloucester. At Gloucester, Bucketts Way meets the southern terminus of Thunderbolts Way that leads to the Northern Tablelands and various other national parks and riverside camping reserves along the way. The Bucketts Way continues eastwards to Krambach and then to Taree where it rejoins the Pacific Highway.

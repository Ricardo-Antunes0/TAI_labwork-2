Swedenâ€“Tunisia relations refers to the current and historical relationship between Sweden and Tunisia.  Sweden has had a long-standing relationship with Tunisia. The two countries have collaborated on a number of projects, including co-operation in the agricultural, environmental, health, and education sectors. Sweden has also offered Tunisia assistance in the form of development aid and technical assistance. In 2007, the two countries signed a cooperation agreement aimed at boosting trade and investment between the two countries. Tunisia is also a fellow member of the Nordic Council.  The relationship between Sweden and Tunisia has been strained in recent years by the Tunisian government's engagement in the Syrian Civil War. Sweden has criticised Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi for his support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Tunisia has accused Sweden of hypocrisy for its support of the Libyan rebels. Nonetheless, bilateral relations are still cordial overall.

Naked Evil is a black-and-white independent 1966 British horror film, produced by Michael F. Johnson, and written and directed by Stanley Goulder. The film stars Basil Dingnam, Anthony Ainley, Richard Coleman and John Ashley Hamilton. It tells a story of voodoo activities in an all-male student hostel in a fictitious English city, where the brilliant resident students are from Jamaica and other countries in the Commonwealth realm. The bizarre events at the hostel and a local neighbourhood are investigated by a detective inspector who, with the help of a priest, comes to realise that he's not dealing with the usual sort of crime. They discover what several of the students already know: that the hostel's elderly caretaker is a Jamaican 'obi man' who is responsible for the evil that has enveloped the hostel. The film is based on the BBC-TV play The Obi by Jon Manchip White. After its UK release, Naked Evil was theatrically released in the US with the black-and-white tinted so that it appeared to be in colour. It was released again as a television movie under the title Exorcism at Midnight, with a modified plot and new full-colour sequences featuring an American cast.

A land defender, land protector, or environmental defender is an activist who works to protect the earth's land and the human right to a safe, healthy environment.  Land defenders are very often members of Indigenous communities who are protecting their land rights and land-based traditions. Land defenders reject the term "protester" because they believe it has negative connotations and links to colonialism; they claim that they are performing a sacred duty through non-violent resistance to activities which endanger the land. Land is considered sacred by Indigenous peoples and caring for and protecting land is considered a duty to honour ancestors, to current peoples, and future generations. Land defenders face severe persecution from powerful political and commercial alliances that profit from resource extraction and development. The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has determined that land defenders are 'among the human rights defenders who are most exposed and at risk.' Global Witness reported 1,922 murders of land defenders in 57 countries between 2002 and 2019, with indigenous people accounting for approximately one third of this total. Documentation of this violence is also incomplete. The UN Special Rapporteur on human rights reported that as many as one hundred land defenders are intimidated, arrested or otherwise harassed for every one that is killed.

Alexios Stoudites or Alexius Studites  (? â€“ May 1083 AD) was Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 1072 to 1083. He was also a theologian and philosopher.  He was born in Constantinople, the son of the nobleman George Stoudites and his wife Theodora Kontostephanina. He studied at the universities of Paris and Bologna, where he became interested in theology and philosophy. In 1070 he became a monk at the Monastery of Chora on the Golden Horn, and in 1072 he was elected Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople by the clergy and people of his see.  As patriarch, Alexius was an advocate for religious tolerance, promoting ecumenism with both the West and the East. He also worked to improve relations between Byzantium and the Muslim states in Anatolia, though his efforts were largely unsuccessful. In 1095 he convened an assembly of bishops from throughout Christendom at Constantinople to discuss the problems faced by Christians in the East, but this conference also failed to produce any lasting results.  Alexius died on May 1083, aged 76, and was buried in the Church of Holy Apostles near his palace on the Golden Horn. He had no children and thus left no direct heirs to his throne or ecclesiastical office.

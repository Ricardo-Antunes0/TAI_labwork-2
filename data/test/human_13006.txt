John Greene Sr. (9 February 1597 â€“ 7 January 1659) was an early settler of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, one of the 12 original proprietors of Providence, and a co-founder of the town of Warwick in the colony, sailing from England with his family in 1635. He first settled in Salem in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, but he had difficulty with the Puritan authority and soon followed Roger Williams to Providence, becoming one of the original proprietors of that town.  In 1643, he joined Samuel Gorton and ten others in purchasing land that became the town of Warwick.  Difficulties with Massachusetts ensued, until he accompanied Gorton on a trip to England where they secured royal recognition of their town. Once Warwick became safe from external threats, Greene became active in its government. He served on the town council, was Deputy to the General Court of the colony, and served as magistrate of the General Court of Trials.  He died in the last days of 1658, being survived by his wife and six grown children, and becoming the ancestor of many prominent citizens.

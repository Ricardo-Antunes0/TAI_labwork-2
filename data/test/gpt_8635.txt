The Hashemite Kingdom of Hejaz (, Al-Mamlakah al-Hejaziyyah) was a constitutional monarchy in Western Asia, occupying the eastern end of the Arabian Peninsula. It was ruled by the Hashemite dynasty, a branch of the Sharifian dynasty.  The Hejaz was under Ottoman suzerainty from 1517 to 1918. It became a protectorate of France in 1921 and then a French mandate in 1923. The kingdom had its own governorates, parliament and flag until 1946, when it became part of the newly established Saudi Arabia.

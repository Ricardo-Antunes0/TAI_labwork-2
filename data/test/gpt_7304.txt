Mahmudiye, named for Sultan Mahmud II, was the first ironclad warship ever built in the Ottoman Empire. She was laid down in 1869 and launched in 1872, completing her trials in 1875. Mahmudiye served with the Ottoman fleet until 1908, when she was stricken from the naval register.  Mahmudiye was an advanced design for her time, incorporating a number of innovative features. She was the first Ottoman warship to feature a armoured deck, and was also the first to be fitted with a compound steam engine. Mahmudiye was also notable for her crew, who were highly trained and experienced in operating ironclads.

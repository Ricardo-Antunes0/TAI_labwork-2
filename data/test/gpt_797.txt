In pottery hausmaler  is a term that is used to describe a type of pottery that is decorated with a series of simple geometric designs. This type of pottery was popular in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and is now considered to be a historical artifact.  The term hausmaler is derived from the German word "hausm√§ler," which means "house painter." This term was first used in the seventeenth century to describe a type of pottery that was decorated with simple geometric designs. These designs were typically painted on the pottery using a brush or a roller, and were often inspired by classical art.  The popularity of this type of pottery peaked in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and it has since been largely forgotten. However, there are still a few surviving examples, and they are increasingly becoming rare. Today, they are mostly found in museums, where they are often displayed as historical artifacts.

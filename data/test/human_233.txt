Lagarde or Bodega Lagarde is a family-owned winery located in the Luj√°n de Cuyo Department located in the west of the Mendoza Province, Argentina and was founded in 1897.  Lagarde consists of five Mendoza vineyards and is currently owned and managed by the Pescarmona family.  The winery is currently run by the third generation Pescarmonas: Sofia Pescarmona and Lucila Pescarmona, with Juan Roby Stordeur as the winemaker since 2002. History  Artillery Capitan Don Jose Angel Pereira founded Lagarde in 1897 after a military campaign in the Mendoza region.  He planted both Malbec and Cabernet Franc varietals.  Some of his original vines still produce grapes for the Lagarde Malbec.  When the great grandchild of Jose Angel had no heirs to take control of Lagarde, he decided to pass on the vineyard to his close friend, Luis Menotti Pescarmona in 1969.  Under Pescarmona ownership, the winery has acquired 4 additional vineyards and introduce multiple new varietals.

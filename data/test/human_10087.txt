Save Point Lowly is a community action group based in Whyalla, South Australia. The group was formed circa 2008 to present an alternative vision for the future of the Point Lowly area north-west of Whyalla and resist plans for heavy industrialization. The group aspired to raising the profile of the Point Lowly area, including the giant Australian cuttlefish aggregation, which the group believes is under threat from a number of industrial proposals including: a seawater desalination plant for BHP Billiton's Olympic Dam mine, a diesel distribution hub, a technical ammonium nitrate plant (which has since been abandoned) and an iron ore export facility. Collectively these development have been referred to by the Government of South Australia as the Port Bonython Minerals Precinct. The group's spokesperson and chairman is Andrew Melville-Smith who is a practising veterinarian and resident of Whyalla. Activity  The group has been engaged in petitioning, disseminating information to the public, lobbying of local and State government and protest activity since 2008. In 2009 the group staged a protest at the Whyalla airport, confronting Premier Mike Rann and visiting ministers including Paul Holloway. The protest was an effort to represent their views regarding the preservation of Point Lowly and to request hearings with the Premier and his cabinet after allegedly being denied the opportunity through formal channels.

Cyclopamine (11-deoxojervine) is a naturally occurring chemical with antidepressant and antipsychotic effects. It has been investigated for its potential as a treatment for major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder. In December 2017, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved cyclopamine for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults.

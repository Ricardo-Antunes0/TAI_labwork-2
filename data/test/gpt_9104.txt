Burigon (died 1820), also called Burragong or Buragong, was an early settler of the Swan River Colony in Western Australia.  Burigon was born in the mid-eighteenth century to a family of shepherds in Wales. In 1792 he arrived in Van Diemens Land (now Western Australia) as part of the First Fleet, and soon became one of the colony's leading farmers. In 1820 he was killed in a clash with local Aborigines.  Burigon is best known for his role in establishing the first European settlement at Guildford, on the Swan River near Perth. He is also remembered for his patriotic song, "The British Grenadiers".

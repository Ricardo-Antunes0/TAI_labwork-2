It lies approximately  south of Bukowsko,  south-west of Sanok, and  south of the regional capital Rzeszów. History The village was established in 1553, and there were several subsequent waves of settlement, notably in the years 1589, 1699, and 1748. The name "Przybyszow" derives from a word meaning "newcomer" or "stranger".  The village was located on land previously owned by the Polish nobleman Nicholas Herburt Odnowski since 1539 (More history, in Polish, about Odnowski can be found at this link In the year 1898 the village had 393 inhabitants and 62 houses, the village area was 6.37 km ². It was owned at that time by a Polish noble family named Scibor-Rylski. From November 1918 to January 1919 it was part of the Komańcza Republic . The village ceased to exist after World War II, when the entire population was deported to Ukraine as part of Soviet and Polish population exchange operations. (UPA sotnias (units) had been stationed in this village, and the village was subsequently burned.)  None of the original structures exist, although excavation would likely reveal their foundations.

Five Serpent's Teeth is the third album by the American heavy metal band Slipknot. It was released on October 30, 2008, through Roadrunner Records. Recording took place from June to August 2008 at The Volcanic Studio in Park City, Utah with producer Jimmy Smith.  The album's title is taken from a Navajo creation story about the battle between the forces of good and evil. The five serpents were said to be the tongues of a monster that lived in a cave beneath the earth. The five snakes were eventually defeated by a group of brave warriors who cut off their tongues.  "Five Serpent's Teeth" is Slipknot's heaviest and most extreme album to date, featuring longer tracks, more brutal solos and lyrics focused on violence and mythology. The album was met with mixed reviews from music critics; some praised its heavier sound, others found it unoriginal. However, it has since attained a cult following.

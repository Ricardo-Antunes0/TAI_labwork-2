Wolf Haven International, originally known as Wolf Haven America and Wolf Haven Country, is a wolf sanctuary and management 501(c)(3) non-profit organization headquartered in Tenino, Washington, that focuses on wolves. Founded in 1982 by Steve and Linda Kuntz, the organization provides educational programs on wolves, engages in wolf-related activism, and operates a sanctuary that houses displaced, captive-born wolves. It also fosters and participates in captive-breeding programs for two highly endangered types of wolves, the red wolf and the Mexican wolf. Wolf Haven is one of three facilities in the United States that provides pre-release housing for Mexican gray wolves bred for Southwest restoration programs. Over 55 animals are harbored at its  refuge, and a smaller public area can be toured by visitors with reservations. These include gray wolves, Mexican wolves, red wolves, wolfdogs and two coyotes. With the recent acquisition of a second wolf sanctuary in Bridger, Montana, which has 35 wolves, Wolf Haven International cares for a total of 95 animals.

Nepal Janabadi Morcha (lit. Nepal Democratic Front) is a leftwing political movement in Nepal. The group was founded in 1976, and worked clandestinely during the panchayat regime, and its chairman Ram Raja Prasad Singh lived in exile in India. After the successful Constituent Assembly election in April 2008, Ram Raja Prasad Singh was proposed by the CPN(M) as a potential candidate to become the first president of the Federal Republic of Nepal. On June 20, 1985, several bombs detonated throughout the country. Eight people were killed. Few days later NJM claimed responsibility. The explosions spurred hundreds of arrests. The National Panchayat pronounced death sentences in absentia for the NJM leadership, Ram Raja Prasad Singh, Laxman Prasad Singh (vice chairman) and Khema Raj Mayalu (general secretary). Dr. Laxmi Narayan Jha, Iswar Lama, Padam Lama, Maheswar Chaulagain and Saket Mishra were amongst those arrested after the attacks whom disappeared while in custody.

The Battle of Murino took place on 23 October 1944, as part of the Italian Campaign of World War II. The battle was fought between the Allied forces, commanded by General Mark W. Clark, and the Axis forces, commanded by General Arnulfo Lacapra.  The Allied forces began their offensive on 23 October 1944, with an attack by the U.S. Fifth Army against the Gustav Line. The attack was successful and resulted in the collapse of the Axis line. The Axis forces retreated to the town of Murino, which was then besieged by the Allied forces. On 28 October, a relief force led by General Alfredo Guzzoni arrived and relieved the siege.

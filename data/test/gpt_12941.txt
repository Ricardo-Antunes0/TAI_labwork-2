Tophane  is a quarter in the central district of Istanbul, Turkey. It is bordered by the neighborhoods of Beşiktaş to the southwest, Şişli to the east, Emirgan to the northeast, and Ümraniye to the northwest.  Tophane was first developed in the late Ottoman period as a residential area for the military and civil service. It was later occupied by Greek immigrants who established a small community in the area. After World War I, Tophane became increasingly popular among Istanbul's working class residents. The quarter has since undergone significant gentrification and now features a diverse range of restaurants, bars, and retail stores.

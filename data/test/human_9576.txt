Covenant Health System is an American health care provider which serves West Texas and Eastern New Mexico. It has about 1,300 beds in its five primary acute-care and specialty hospitals; it also manages about a dozen affiliated community hospitals. Covenant Health System, part of the St. Joseph Health System (since 2016: Providence St. Joseph Health), also maintains a network of family health care and medical clinics. Covenant Health System's major facilities are Covenant Medical Center, Covenant Specialty Hospital, and Covenant Children's Hospital. The health system also includes some 20 clinics and 50 physician practices, and its extensive outreach programs target isolated rural communities with mobile services. Covenant Health was founded in 1998 through the merger of two of Lubbock's health care facilities, St. Mary of the Plains Hospital and the Lubbock Methodist Hospital System. History In 1918 the thirty-five bed Lubbock Sanitarium, was established, by Drs. J. T. Hutchinson, O.F. Peebler and A. R. Ponton on land donated by Dr. Marvin Cartwell Overton. In 1942 it was incorporated as Lubbock General Hospital, and renamed Lubbock Memorial Hospital in honor of soldiers from Lubbock who died during World War II. In 1953 the hospital opened in a new facility on 19th Street with the name Methodist Hospital under ownership of the Northwest Texas Conference of the United Methodist Church. In the late 1980s and in the 1990s, Methodist Hospital completed mergers that expanded its presence to nearby Levelland and Plainview. Methodist Hospital is now known as "Covenant Medical Center".

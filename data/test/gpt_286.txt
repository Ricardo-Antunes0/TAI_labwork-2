Hypertrophic Osteodystrophy (HOD) is a bone disease caused by the overuse of the muscles. The disease is typically inherited and becomes more severe with age.  HOD is a disorder of the muscle that causes progressive weakening and enlargement of the bone. The bone becomes brittle and can fracture easily. The affected muscles often become so large and strong that they can damage other tissues in the body.  There is currently no cure for HOD, but treatment focuses on managing the symptoms. Treatment usually includes weight loss, physical therapy, and medication to reduce inflammation and pain. Some people may require surgery to remove affected muscles.

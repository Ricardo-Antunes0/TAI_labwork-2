The Yurok (Karuk language: Yur√∫kvaarar / Yuruarvaar), are a Native American people of the North Coast region of California. They are enrolled in the Klamath Tribes, who were formerly known as the Yurok Tribe. The Yurok live on the Klamath River and its tributaries, in an area that includes portions of Humboldt, Trinity and Del Norte counties.  The Yurok are an extinct people who spoke a member of the Karuk language. The last fluent speaker of the language died in 1996. However, there are still numerous elderly speakers of the language who can provide invaluable documentation and insight into the culture and history of this tribe. The Yurok are a matrilineal society, with property and inheritance passed through the maternal line.  Today, the largest community of Yurok is located at Klamath River Indian Reservation in Klamath County, California. There are also scattered populations located on other reservations throughout California and Oregon.

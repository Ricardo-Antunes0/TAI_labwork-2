The Bear Inn, today known as The Old Bear, is a grade II listed building located in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, south Wales. The inn is thought to date back to the 16th century and was once a popular stopping point for travellers on the stagecoach route between Cardiff and Swansea.  The Old Bear has been a pub since at least the 17th century and was most likely originally a farmhouse or manor house. It was first mentioned in records in 1626 when it was leased by Sir Thomas Knyvett. The Bear Inn passed through several hands over the years and by the early 19th century it had fallen into disrepair. In 1825, however, it was purchased by John Richards, who restored it and renamed it The Old Bear. Richards remained owner of The Old Bear until his death in 1875.  During the early 20th century, The Old Bear began to decline in popularity due to the increasing popularity of hotels and pubs. In 1939, it was sold to Hugh Jones who converted it into a hotel. The Old Bear closed its doors for good in 1978.  The Old Bear is today a Grade II listed building and is still open for business as a hotel.

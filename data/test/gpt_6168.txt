Nullification, in United States constitutional history, is the doctrine that a state, through its own legislation, can declare void and of no effect any federal law within its territory that is deemed unconstitutional or invalid. Nullification first appeared in the Constitution of the United States as a remedy to what was seen as an unconstitutional overreach of the federal government by the Constitution's framers. Today it is used as a legal strategy to challenge federal laws that are seen as unconstitutional or too broad in their application.  The doctrine has been used most notably by Southern states during the American Civil War, when they refused to comply with Federal laws that they saw as violations of states' rights. In more recent times, nullification has been used to challenge federal laws regarding issues such as marijuana legalization and gun control.

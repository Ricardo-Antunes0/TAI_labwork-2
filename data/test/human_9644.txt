Fred W. Henne (January 14, 1914 â€“ January 22, 1998) was a labour leader, businessman and politician in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Henne arrived in Yellowknife, NWT from British Columbia as a labour union negotiator in early 1947, and successfully negotiated the first collective bargaining agreement at the Con Mine and Giant Mine in Yellowknife. Soon thereafter, he decided to go into private business and purchased a controlling interest in the Frame & Perkins garage and automobile dealership in Yellowknife, which he operated from 1949 to 1980. Henne's political career began with various stints on the early Yellowknife Town Council, winning seats in the November 1947, November 1948, November 1950, November 1951 (appointed chairman of Trustee Council for 1952), and November 1953 elections. In January 1955, he was named deputy mayor under mayor Gordon A. Allen. In the November 1955 election, he ran a successful campaign as mayoral candidate against a single opponent. His term of office ran from January 1, 1956 to December 31, 1957. He was the first elected mayor of Yellowknife; the two municipal mayors previous were either acclaimed candidates or appointed.

Diorhabda carinata is a species of leaf beetle known as the larger tamarisk beetle (larger tamarisk beetle) which feeds on tamarisk trees from Ukraine, eastern Turkey and Syria east to northwest China, Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan, extending as far south as southern Iran. It is used in North America as a biological pest control agent against  saltcedar or tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), an invasive species in arid and semi-arid ecosystems (where the larger tamarisk beetle and its closely related sibling species also may be less accurately referred to as the 'saltcedar beetle', 'saltcedar leaf beetle', 'salt cedar leaf beetle', or 'tamarisk leaf beetle'). Taxonomy The larger tamarisk beetle was first described from the Transcaucasus (Georgia and Azerbaijan) as Galeruca carinata Faldermann, 1837. Reiche and Saulcy placed G. carinata as a junior synonym to the sibling species G. elongata Brullé (the Mediterranean tamarisk beetle, Diorhabda elongata). Weise created the genus Diorhabda in 1893 and proposed the color variant Diorhaba elongata var. carinata (Faldermann), and he also placed the sibling species Galeruca carinulata Desbrochers (the northern tamarisk beetle, Diorhabda carinulata) as a junior synonym of this variant. Jan Bechyné (1961) proposed the subspecies D. e. carinata listing specimens from Afghanistan. Berti and Rapilly (1973) recognized D. carinata and D. carinulata as separate species from one another, and, by implication, as separate species from D. elongata, based on detailed morphology of the endophallus of the male genitalia. Tracy and Robbins (2009) confirmed the 1973 findings of Berti and Rapilly, further characterized the male and female genitalia of D. carinata, and provided illustrated taxonomic keys separating the larger tamarisk beetle from the four other sibling species of the D. elongata (Brullé) species group: Diorhabda elongata, Diorhabda sublineata (Lucas), Diorhabda carinulata, and Diorhabda meridionalis Berti and Rapilly. In literature prior to 2009, D. carinata was usually also referred to as D. elongata, or subspecies of D. elongata.

Seaport-Airport Road (SPAP Road) is supposed to be a new expressway that will connect the city of Manila with the airport in Clark International Airport.   The project has been in the works for years but has seen many delays due to various issues, including protests from environmentalists. The latest update is that construction is set to start in 2019 and be completed by 2024.  The project has been met with criticism from environmentalists who argue that the road will destroy natural habitats and disrupt the local ecosystem.

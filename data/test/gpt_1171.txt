Polynomial chaos (PC), also called Polynomial chaos theory, is a branch of mathematics that studies the behavior of dynamical systems that are polynomial in their coefficients. PC is a subset of chaos theory, which is the study of dynamical systems that are not necessarily polynomial in their coefficients.  Polynomial chaos is a particularly interesting and important type of chaos because it is the only kind of chaos that can be described by a deterministic algorithm. This means that the behavior of a polynomial-chaotic system can be predicted exactly, provided that enough information about the initial condition and the evolution of the system is available. This makes polyomial chaos an ideal tool for studying the behavior of systems with long-term dependencies, such as weather patterns or financial markets.  PC has been used to study a wide range of phenomena, including chaotic dynamics in physical systems, and chaotic oscillations in mathematical models of communication and electrical circuits. Recent work has also shown that PC can be used to model the chaotic dynamics of complex networks, and to predict the evolution of these networks in response to perturbations.

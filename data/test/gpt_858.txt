Convergence and Union (, CiU; ) was a political alliance in the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and the Catalan regionalist Convergence and Union (Unió).  The alliance was formed on 10 December 1986, after the PSOE won a large number of seats in the 1986 general election in Catalonia, despite being reduced to just 17% of the vote. The alliance was initially composed of two parties: the PSOE and Convergence, with the third partner, Unió, being added in 1988.  The alliance played a significant role in Catalan politics during its existence, as it was able to form governments in both Catalonia and Spain with the help of other parties. The alliance was dissolved on 28 January 2006 after failing to agree on a way forward following the 2004 Spanish General Election.

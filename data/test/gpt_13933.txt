The American Campaign Medal is a military award of the United States Armed Forces that was created on February 9, 1942 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to recognize members of the United States military who have served in areas within the continental United States during World War II. This award is also known as the "Good Conduct Medal" or "Combat Infantryman Badge". The medal is a bronze disk 1 1/4 inches in diameter, with an eagle on the front, and "American Campaign" and "WWII" on the reverse. The medal is suspended from a bronze bar with a 24-karat gold clasp.  The American Campaign Medal was first awarded to members of the U.S. military for service during World War II between December 7, 1941, and May 8, 1945. The requirements for the American Campaign Medal were first established in January 1942 and expanded in April 1945. Service in certain territories outside of the continental United States, such as Alaska and Hawaii, was also recognized for qualifying for this award. As of 2014, approximately 1.2 million members of the U.S. military have been awarded the American Campaign Medal.

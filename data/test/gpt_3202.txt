The Ekatmata Yatras were a series of ten long pilgrimages undertaken by the great Hindu philosopher and saint Ramakrishna in the early twentieth century.  Ramakrishna was one of the most celebrated and influential religious figures of his time, and his pilgrimage tours were highly anticipated by both his followers and the general public. The Ekatmata Yatras were a chance for ordinary people to gain direct access to Ramakrishna's divine wisdom, and were often seen as a means of healing spiritual wounds and helping people find their true Purpose in life.  The Ekatmata Yatras are now considered an important part of Hindu history, and are often used as an example of how the power of faith can help ordinary people achieve extraordinary feats.

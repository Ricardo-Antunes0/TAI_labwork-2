Byers Peninsula is a mainly ice-free peninsula which forms the northwestern extremity of Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada. It is long, narrow and has a generally north-south orientation. The peninsula is bounded on the east by Amsterdam Bay, on the south by Hudson Bay and on the west by Cumberland Sound.  The peninsula is named after Captain Byers, who led an expedition to this area in 1821. The first Europeans to explore the peninsula were John Ross and James Clark Ross, who sailed up Amsterdam Bay in 1819. In 1821, Byers led an expedition which explored the area north of Cumberland Sound. He named the peninsula after himself. The peninsula has been an important region for both Canadian and Inuit cultures for centuries. The area was first settled by Europeans in the 17th century, and was part of Rupert's Land until it was ceded to Canada in 1867.  The peninsula is a popular tourist destination because of its natural attractions, including glaciers, lakes and mountains. The most popular destination is Kivalliq National Park, which is located on the east side of Amsterdam Bay. Other attractions include Cumberland Sound and Eagle Island.

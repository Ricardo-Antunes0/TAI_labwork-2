Tesoma railway station (abbreviated Tso) is a railway station located in Tesoma, a suburb in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand. It is served by Transdev Canterbury Line services.  The station was opened in 1877 as part of the Christchurch-Dunedin Railway, and was one of the original stations on the line. The station closed for regular passenger services on 6 September 2002, but reopened as a limited stop station on 12 July 2004 as part of the Greater Christchurch Regeneration Programme.  The original station building is heritage-listed, and is now used for storage. A new station building was opened in July 2004 and is also heritage-listed.   In October 2016, the New Zealand Transport Agency announced that Tesoma would close permanently on 31 December 2016 due to budget constraints. However, it reopened temporarily on 4 February 2017 due to public demand due to the closure.   The station is served by Transdev Canterbury Line services operated by Veolia Transport New Zealand.

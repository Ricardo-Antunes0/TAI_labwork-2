Gustavo Milano, (born 11 February 1961 in Buenos Aires, Argentina) is an Argentine composer who has been living in Germany since 1990. Milano's music is characterized by its use of extended techniques and its improvisational nature.  Gustavo Milano was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina on February 11, 1961. He began his musical education at the age of six, studying classical piano with Elena Bertinelli. In 1978, he entered the University of Buenos Aires to study composition with Claudio Roditi and Enrique Bazzini. He subsequently studied composition with Helmut Lachenmann and Wolfgang Rihm at the Berlin University of the Arts (BFA 1984), where he also received his DFA in 1986.  Milano's music is characterized by its extended techniques and improvisational nature. His early works often featured aleatoric treatments of traditional material, such as in his string quartet No. 2 (1982). Later works have gradually moved away from aleatoricism towards more conventional form-building strategies, though they retain a free and open character. His most famous work is probably the opera Don Giovanni (1996), which has been performed around the world and has been influential in the development of post-modern opera. In recent years, Milano has turned his attention to new media, composing works for acoustic and electronic instruments as well as for computerized multimedia installations.

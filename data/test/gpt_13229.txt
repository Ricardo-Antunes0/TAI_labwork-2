Viridiplantae (literally "green plants") are a clade of the plant kingdom, consisting of the sole surviving lineage of green plants. They are distinguished from other plants by their lack of secondary growth, their broad leaves, and their lack of vascular tissue.  The Viridiplantae are divided into two subfamilies: the Liliaceae and the Orchidaceae. The Liliaceae includes the lily and the orchid, while the Orchidaceae includes the orchids, Umbelliferae, and Cypripediidae. The Viridiplantae are thought to have diverged about 125 million years ago.

Gylon , also known as Gylon of the Hundred Eyes or Gylon the Raven, was a giant of Greek mythology who was said to have inhabited places such as Lemnos and Rhodes. He was feared by mortals and gods alike, and is mentioned in the Iliad and Odyssey.  Gylon was said to be the son of Eurytus and Ocyrrhoe, and brother of Pandaros. He had 100 eyes, which gave him great power over the minds of men. He was also skilled in prophecy, and could understand all languages. Gylon's chief weapon was a bow with which he could shoot arrows through the air with incredible speed.  Gylon often fought on the side of the gods, but he also had a dark side. On one occasion he kidnapped Andromache, wife of Hector, and took her to Lemnos. Andromache managed to escape and warn Hector, who attacked Lemnos and freed Andromache.  Gylon also had a rivalry with Heracles. On one occasion they fought a duel at sea, in which Heracles emerged victorious.

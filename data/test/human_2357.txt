Typhoon Hester was a severe typhoon that formed in the 1952 Pacific typhoon season and continued into January 1953. As the twenty-ninth storm and twentieth typhoon of the season, it was first tracked by Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) near the Marshall Islands as a tropical storm on December 27. Hester quickly became a typhoon and rapidly intensified. Near the end of the year, Hester became a Category 5 typhoon on the modern-day Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane wind scale south of Guam. The typhoon soon weakened quickly as it curved eastward and sped up. It weakened into a tropical storm on January 4, and JTWC ceased tracking it hours later. In preparations for the storm, shelters were opened in Guam, and all government buildings and businesses were closed. In Marshall Islands, Enewetak experienced significant flooding, and buildings were damaged by the wind. Eighteen people were injured on the island. In Guam, the only damages reported were destroyed crops due to waves and washed out roads. There were no fatalities caused by the storm.

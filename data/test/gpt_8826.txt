The ranch has been in the family of the Eskelin's since 1880, when the first land was purchased. In that year, Ed Eskelin and his brother-in-law, A. J. Wylie, brought 4,000 head of cattle from New Mexico to establish the first operations on the ranch.  In 1892, the first house was built on the property, and it served as home to Ed Eskelin and his wife, Lillian; their two daughters; and A. J. Wylie's family. In 1901, a two-story frame building was constructed to house the office, barns, corrals, and other outbuildings on the property. In 1907, a large cotton gin was installed on the property to handle cotton grown on the surrounding land.  In 1971, the Ed Eskelin Ranch ceased operations due to changes in agricultural practices and competition from larger ranches. The ranch today is a working cattle and horse ranch managed by third-generation descendants

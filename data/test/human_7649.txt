Michael J. Harder (born February 8, 1973) is a Canadian former ice hockey coach and center who was an All-American for North Dakota. Career Harder arrived in Hamilton in the fall of 1993 after finishing out his junior career with the Weyburn Red Wings. He began producing offense immediately for Colgate, tying for the team lead in points as a freshman and being named to the ECAC All-Rookie team. Harder finished in the top ten in the nation the following year, helping Colgate win 20 games and finish 3rd in the conference standings. Harder remained the focal point of the Red Raiders' offense over the next two years, and was named team captain in his senior season. While the team managed to produce winning records in those years, they lost all three of their playoff games. Despite the disappointing finishes, Harder became Colgate's all-time leading scorer and was named an All-American in his final year.

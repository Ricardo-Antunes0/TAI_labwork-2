San Antonio Springs (also known as the San Antonio River) is a spring located in the Hill Country region of Texas. The springs are part of the San Antonio River National Wildlife Refuge and are situated along the San Antonio River.  The San Antonio Springs are located in Bexar County, approximately northeast of downtown San Antonio, Texas. The springs are part of the San Antonio River National Wildlife Refuge and are situated along the San Antonio River. The refuge is home to a variety of wildlife, including bald eagles, ospreys, and American alligators.   The springs have been used by Native Americans for centuries. Spanish explorers discovered the springs in 1519 and named them "Las Conchas" ("The Shells"). In 1849, an American military officer named Charles DeWitt Smith discovered the springs while on a hunting expedition. Smith named the springs after Saint Anthony of Padua, who was also known as San Ant√≥nio de Padua. The city of San Antonio purchased the springs from Smith in 1884.

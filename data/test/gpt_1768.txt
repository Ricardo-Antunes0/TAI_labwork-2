Mellerstain House is a stately home around four miles northwest of Wigan in Greater Manchester, England. It is the ancestral home of the Dukes of Westminster.  The Dukes of Westminster purchased the estate in 1762 from the Mellerstains, who had been living there since at least the 16th century. The present house was designed by James Wyatt and built between 1768 and 1772. The house is noted for its Palladian architecture, particularly its three-storey portico and its elaborate plasterwork. The estate also includes a number of outbuildings, including a folly, a dovecote, and a stables.  The house is open to the public on select days during the summer months.

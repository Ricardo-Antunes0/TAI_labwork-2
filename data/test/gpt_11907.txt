R. Hanoch ben Moses (Hebrew: רבנו חנוך בן משה‎, "Reb Hanoch ben Moses", c. 990 – 1040) was a Talmudic scholar and the foremost commentator on the Mishnah.   Hanoch was born in Sandomierz, Poland, sometime in the early 10th century CE. He is generally considered to have been born in or near 990 CE. He was one of the most important commentators on the Mishnah and other early rabbinic texts, and is known as the "Rosh Yeshiva" of his era. He died in 1040 CE.  Hanoch's commentary on the Mishnah is known as the "Mishnah Berurah", and is considered authoritative by most modern scholars. In addition to his monumental commentary, Hanoch wrote several other works, including a responsa and a treatise on grammar.

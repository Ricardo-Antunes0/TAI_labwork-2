The tsunami bomb was an attempt during World War II by the Japanese to use a nuclear weapon as a maritime bomb. The plan was for a nuclear bomb to be dropped from a bomber over Tokyo Bay, triggering a massive tsunami that would crash on the city. If successful, the resulting destruction would have been catastrophic.  Fortunately for the Allies, the plan was never put into action. The Japanese were never able to develop a nuclear weapon that could be used effectively in this way, and their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.

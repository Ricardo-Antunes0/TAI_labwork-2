Werner Poetschke (Brussels, 6 March 1914 â€“ Paris, 1 October 2006) was a Belgian artist, sculptor and architect.  Werner Poetschke was born in Brussels on 6 March 1914. After initially studying architecture at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Belgium (1930-1933), he abandoned this interest in favour of painting and sculpture. In 1948 he moved to Paris, where he would remain for the rest of his life.  Poetschke's early work is characterised by an Expressionist and surrealist sensibility, which is apparent in his sculptures and paintings of the 1940s and 1950s. However, starting in the 1960s he began to experiment with new media, creating works that are often based on mathematics or abstract forms. This experimentation culminated in his masterpiece, the Monument to the Unknown Soldiers (1968), a huge sculpture made from polypropylene and steel that is situated at the centre of a large square in Brussels. Poetschke died in Paris on 1 October 2006 at the age of 94.

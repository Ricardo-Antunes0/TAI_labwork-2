Europe spans seven primary time zones (from UTC+1 to UTC+8), each of which is divided into two time zones, the central European time zone (UTC+1 to UTC+4) and the eastern European time zone (UTC+5 to UTC+11). The standard time of day throughout the continent is Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), which is one hour ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  The various countries in Europe maintain different legal times, with some going as far back as medieval times. For example, the United Kingdom observes British Summer Time (BST), while Portugal and Spain observe Central European Summer Time (CEST). Some parts of the continent have two time zones, while others have only one.

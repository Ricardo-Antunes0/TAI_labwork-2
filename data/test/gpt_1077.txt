A juridical person is a non-human legal entity, such as a corporation or a trust.  A juridical person can be created by a law, by an agreement between two or more people, or by custom.   A juridical person has a separate legal personality from its natural persons who created it. This means that the juridical person can sue and be sued, contract and be contracted to, and hold property.   The main difference between a juridical person and natural persons is that a juridical person cannot be imprisoned for violating the law.

Ocean governance  is the conduct of ocean affairs, typically encompassing all aspects of governance, from the national level down to the local level. It has come to encompass a wide range of interrelated issues and activities, from fisheries management to coastal protection.  Ocean governance is an emerging field that is undergoing rapid development. There are several challenges facing ocean governance, including the increasing complexity of ocean ecosystems and the need for effective management of marine resources.  There are a number of different approaches to ocean governance, including state-based approaches, market-based approaches, and collective approaches. The state-based approach typically relies on the transfer of authority from the state to a governing body, such as an international organization or a regional organization. The market-based approach relies on the application of market mechanisms to achieve desired goals, such as price incentives or regulations that restrict production. The collective approach involves the participation of multiple parties in order to achieve common goals, such as cooperative agreements or treaties.  Oceans have long been seen as valuable resources and a source of food and economic opportunities. Ocean governance has emerged as an important tool for managing these resources in a sustainable manner.

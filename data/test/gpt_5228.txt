Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477 (1981), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a state law making it a crime to burn an American flag was unconstitutional.  The case was brought by Phillip Edwards, who was convicted of burning an American flag in Phoenix, Arizona. The Court overturned Edwards' conviction on the grounds that the law violated his First Amendment rights.

The de Birmingham family (or de Bermingham) are an Anglo-Norman family who were prominent in the medieval and early modern periods in England.  The de Birmingham family can be traced back to the late 11th century, when one of their ancestors, Milo de Birmingham, held land in the parish of Stourton in Worcestershire. The family rose to prominence during the 12th century, when one of their members, Hugh de Birmingham, became Bishop of Worcester. The de Birminghams remained a powerful family throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and played a significant role in English politics. One of their members, Sir Thomas de Birmingham, served as Chancellor of England under King Richard II. The de Birminghams were also involved in the arts, and one of their members, Sir William de Birmingham, was a renowned composer.  Today, the de Birmingham family is still active in English politics and the arts. One of their members, John de Birmingham, is currently Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

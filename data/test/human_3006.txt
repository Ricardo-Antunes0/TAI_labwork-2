Percina maculata, the blackside darter, is a species of freshwater ray-finned fish, a darter from the subfamily Etheostomatinae, part of the family Percidae, which also contains the perches, ruffes and pikeperches. It is a widespread inhabitant of streams and rivers in the Mississippi River watershed.  Like other darters it prefers rocky riffles and sandy runs, but is tolerant of pools and still water as well.  It is one of the 324 fish species found in Tennessee. Physical characteristics The Blackside darter is easily distinguishable by its olive coloration.  The Blackside darter tends to have darker colors, primarily dark browns, olives and blacks, with occasional white parts. A prominent feature on the fish is a  strip along the sides made up of 6-9 black spots. Black spots can also be found below the eyes and on the caudal fin.  On average Blacksides are around two or three inches in length but have the potential for sizes of 4 inches.  The Blackside darter has two dorsal fins and a rounded caudal fin. The first dorsal fin has spinous rays while the second has soft rays. The mouth of the Blackside darter is in a terminal position, which means the mouth opens at the anterior side of the snout.

Sakowitz was a chain of family-owned department stores in the United States that operated from the 1920s to the 1960s.  The Sakowitz chain was founded in Newark, New Jersey, in the 1920s by Israel and Bella Sakowitz. Israel Sakowitz had immigrated to the United States from Poland in 1902 and started a small clothing store in Newark. The Sakowitz store grew rapidly, and by 1930 it had eight locations. In 1934, the Sakowitz brothers merged their businesses into a single chain with forty stores.  By the 1950s, the Sakowitz chain had ninety-six stores. The company struggled during the postwar era, as consumer spending shifted to other areas and more discount stores opened up. In 1960, the Sakowitz chain was sold to Kmart Corporation for $58 million. The Kmart chain closed most of the Sakowitz stores over the next few years, though a few continued to operate until the early 1970s.

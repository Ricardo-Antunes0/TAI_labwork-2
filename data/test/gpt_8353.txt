Graphenated carbon nanotubes are a relatively new type of carbon nanotube that are made up of numerous small graphene sheets that are arranged in a triangular, pentagonal, or hexagonal pattern. Graphenated carbon nanotubes have several potential benefits over other types of carbon nanotubes, including increased strength and stiffness, faster electron transport, and better electronic and thermal conductivity.

Lyell Butte is a  elevation summit located in the Grand Canyon, in Coconino County of northern Arizona, United States. It is situated  east of Grand Canyon Village, immediately east of and below Shoshone Point, and 1.5 mile southeast of Newton Butte, which is the nearest higher neighbor. Topographic relief is significant as Lyell Butte rises  above the Colorado River in 1.5 mile (2.4 km). Access is via the Tonto Trail which traverses the base of the peak. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Lyell Butte is located in a cold semi-arid climate zone, with precipitation runoff draining northeast to the Colorado River via Grapevine and Boulder Creeks. History Lyell Butte was named in 1906 after Sir Charles Lyell (1797–1875), eminent Scottish geologist best known as the author of Principles of Geology. This feature's name was officially adopted in 1906 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The first ascent of Lyell Butte was made January 24, 1970, by Alan Doty via the northwest face/chimney.

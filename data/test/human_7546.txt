Sir David Mackenzie Wilson (born 30 October 1931) is a British archaeologist, art historian, and museum curator, specialising in Anglo-Saxon art and the Viking Age. From 1977 until 1992 he served as the Director of the British Museum, where he had previously worked, from 1955 to 1964, as an assistant keeper. In his role as director of the museum, he became embroiled in the controversy over the ownership of the Elgin Marbles with the Greek government, engaging with a "disastrous" televised debate with Greek Minister of Culture Melina Mercouri. Education Wilson was born on 30 October 1931 in Dacre Banks, near Harrogate, England. He was the son of Joseph Wilson, a minister, and Nora, a lecturer. From 1941 to 1950, Wilson was educated at Kingswood School, a boarding independent school for boys (now co-educational) in Bath, followed by St John's College at the University of Cambridge, from where he obtained a Master of Arts. In 1955 he obtained a graduate degree from the Lund University in Sweden.

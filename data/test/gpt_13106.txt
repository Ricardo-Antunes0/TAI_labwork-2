Farmer-managed natural regeneration (FMNR) is a low-cost, environmentally sustainable land management technique that directly stimulates the natural regeneration of trees and plants on agricultural lands. FMNR is a form of agroforestry, which is a type of land management in which trees and other plants are used to improve soil fertility and provide environmental benefits.  FMNR is a system in which farmers manage forests on their land using traditional farming methods. The forests are usually established in areas that are not appropriate for agriculture or that have been damaged by farming activities. Farmers first clear the area of unwanted vegetation, then plant the desired trees and other plants. The forests will naturally regenerate, and the farmers will periodically mow the forest to control weeds and promote growth.  FMNR is beneficial to the environment because it helps to improve soil fertility and reduce the need for pesticides and other chemicals. It also provides benefits such as reduced energy bills, reduced carbon emissions, and improved air quality. FMNR is becoming more popular because it is a cost-effective way to improve the environment and improve the livelihoods of farmers across the globe.

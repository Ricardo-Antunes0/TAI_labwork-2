Sinuessa  was a city of Latium, located in the central plain of the region. The city was the administrative center of the ancient Roman province of Latium. It is now a archaeological site and a Latin Catholic titular see.  The city was founded by the Romans in the 8th century BC, as 'Nusicaa'. It was first mentioned as Sinuessa in an inscription from the 3rd century BC. In Roman times, it was an important commercial center on the Via Latina.  Sinuessa was sacked by Alaric I in 410 AD, and by Attila in 453 AD. After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, Sinuessa became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom. It was occupied by the Byzantine Empire in 654 AD, and by the Lombards in 753 AD. It passed to the Franks in 846 AD, and to the Holy See in 1084 AD.  Today, Sinuessa is a archaeological site and a Latin Catholic titular see.

Slains Castle, also known as New Slains, is a ruined castle in the north-east of Scotland. The site is located on a promontory overlooking the Firth of Forth, 2.5 miles (4 km) east of Dunfermline.  The castle was built in the 14th century by the Grahams, who were Lords of the Isles. The castle was destroyed in 1493 by Sir James Douglas, 1st Earl of Morton, in retaliation for the execution of his father by James III. The ruins were left to decay until they were purchased by Sir Thomas Telford in 1819 and restored. The castle now houses a visitor centre and museum.

William Thornton Mustard  (August 8, 1914 â€“ October 5, 1996) was an American chemist who specialized in the synthesis of organic molecules. He shared the 1970 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with George Beadle and Edward Teller for their work on the structure of DNA.  Mustard was born in 1914 in Springfield, Missouri. He received his undergraduate degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 1935 and his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1939. After working as a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University, he joined the faculty of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1941.  Mustard is best known for his work on the synthesis of organic molecules, which earned him two Nobel Prizes, one in Chemistry in 1970 with George Beadle and Edward Teller, and one in 1981 with David Baltimore. His work on the structure of DNA also led to new therapies for genetic disorders. Mustard retired from Caltech in 1988 and died five years later at the age of 79.

Emigre  was an award-winning (mostly) quarterly magazine published in the United States from 2002 to 2009.  Emigre was founded in 2002 by a group of editors and writers who were frustrated with the state of American journalism. The magazine strove to break away from the cookie-cutter approach to writing and reporting, and to present a more nuanced, complex, and interesting view of the world.  The magazine was known for its daring and innovative approaches to journalism, its willingness to challenge conventional wisdom, and its insistence on presenting a variety of voices and perspectives in its stories. Some of Emigre’s most celebrated writers and editors include: Sarah Stillman, Jelani Cobb, Franklin Foer, Ed Young, Christopher Hitchens, Toni Morrison, and Junot Díaz.  Emigre ceased publication in 2009 after running into financial difficulties. However, the magazine’s legacy continues through its online presence and the work of its current editors and writers.

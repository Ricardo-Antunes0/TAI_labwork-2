John Jeremy Thorpe (29 April 1929 – 4 October 1995) was an English politician who served as the Member of Parliament for North Devon from 1959 to 1979, and as the Leader of the Liberal Party from 1967 to 1976. Thorpe was also the subject of two criminal trials, one for conspiracy to murder and another for perjury, both of which ended in his acquittal.  Thorpe was born in 1929 in Salford, Lancashire, the son of a policeman. He attended school at Rydalmere Royal Grammar School and then read law at University College, Oxford. Thorpe began his political career in 1959, when he was elected to Parliament for North Devon. He was Liberal Party Leader from 1967 to 1976. Thorpe's tenure as Leader saw the Liberal Party win three general elections: in 1970, 1974, and 1979. Thorpe resigned as Liberal leader in 1976 after he was charged with conspiracy to murder and perjury. The trials resulted in his acquittal on both charges. Thorpe died in 1995, aged 69.

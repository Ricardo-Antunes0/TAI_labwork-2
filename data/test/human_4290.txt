Pterostylis microphylla, commonly known as the small rosette snail orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. As with similar greenhoods, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves flat on the ground but the flowering plants have a single flower with leaves on the flowering spike. In this species, the flower is white and green with narrow, erect lateral sepals and a small labellum. Description Pterostylis microphylla is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of small leaves. The rosette is  in diameter. Flowering plants have a single green and white flower  long and  wide on a flowering stem  high. There are two or three stem leaves  long and  wide on the flowering stem. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or "galea" over the column and the dorsal sepal has a short point. The lateral sepals are held closely against the galea,  long and have thin, erect tips. The labellum is small and not visible from outside the flower. Flowering occurs from August to October.

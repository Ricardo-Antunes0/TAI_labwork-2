Literature in the Esperanto language began before the language itself did. Ludovik Zamenhof, the inventor of Esperanto, wrote a poem in 1887 entitled "Ili vidas lin" (They See Him), which introduced Esperanto to the world. Zamenhof's poem was followed by other works of poetry and prose, but it was not until the early 20th century that Esperanto literature began to emerge in earnest.   The earliest Esperanto writing was often experimental and featureless, but over time writers began to experiment with more traditional forms of literature. These days, Esperanto literature is diverse and includes works of fiction, non-fiction, poetry, drama, and children’s literature. There is also a growing movement of Esperanto writers who are using the language to explore social and political issues.  Esperanto literature is rich and varied, and there is something for everyone to enjoy.

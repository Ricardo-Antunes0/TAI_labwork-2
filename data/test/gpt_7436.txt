The 2004–05 Euroleague was the fifth season of the top-tier professional basketball league in Europe.  The 2004–05 season marked the return of the Euroleague to Greece after a two-year absence. The season also featured the debut of two new teams: the Spanish club Valencia and the Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow. FC Barcelona, who had won the previous three Euroleague titles, were absent from the competition for financial reasons. The season culminated with the Euroleague Final Four, which was held in Istanbul and saw FC Barcelona defeat Real Madrid, who had been runner-up in each of the past two seasons.  The 2004–05 Euroleague was contested by 14 teams. The first stage of the season involved a round-robin format, with each team playing every other team twice. The top four teams progressed to the knockout stage, where they played quarter-finals, semi-finals and the final four. Valencia and Lokomotiv Moscow were promoted to the 2006–07 Euroleague, while Aris and Panathinaikos were relegated to the 2005–06 Greek Basket League.

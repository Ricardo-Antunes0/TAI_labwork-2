Røros Church or Bergstadens Ziir  is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Røros municipality in Trøndelag county, Norway. Located in the town of Røros, it is the main church for the Røros parish which is part of the Gauldal prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nidaros. The octagonal, whitewashed stone church was built in 1784 using plans drawn up by the architect Peter Leonard Neumann from Trondheim. The church seats about 1,600 people, making it the 5th largest church within the Church of Norway. It is also ranked by Riksantikvaren as one of the ten most high-profile churches in Norway. Since 1999, Røros Church is known as one of the concert venues of the Norwegian Advent Concert Series. History   The first church in Røros was built in 1651, not too long after the town was founded in 1644. The mining town is entirely based around the Røros Copper Works. Prior to the founding of the town, the area was part of the Ålen Church parish. The first church was a wooden long church. By the 18th century, the church was in poor condition and planning began for a new, larger church for the growing town.

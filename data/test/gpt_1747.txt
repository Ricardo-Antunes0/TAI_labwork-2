The Battle of Belmont was fought on October 14, 1864, as part of the American Civil War. Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, led by General James Longstreet, attempted to cross the Blue Ridge Mountains and invade Union-held Washington, D.C., while Union General Ulysses S. Grant's army defended the nation's capital.   The Union army was commanded by General Grant and consisted of over 100,000 men. Lee's army was significantly smaller, numbering only about 50,000 men. The battle began with an attack by the Union cavalry on Confederate positions on the east side of the Blue Ridge, but the Confederate infantry managed to hold their positions. Lee then sent his infantry into the attack, but they were met with heavy fire and were pushed back. In the afternoon, Union reinforcements arrived and began to push back the Confederate soldiers. At this point, Lee ordered a retreat and the battle was over.

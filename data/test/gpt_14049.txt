Wolverton Manor (also Ulwartone, 11th century; Wolveton, 12th century) was an English manor house in Wolverton, Buckinghamshire. It was the seat of the Ulwartone family. The estate passed to the Cavendish family in 1692 and then to the Dukes of Devonshire in 1711. In 1815 the manor was sold to George IV and it became a royal residence, before being sold in 1924. It is now a Grade II* listed building.  The manor was first mentioned in 1086 as Ulwartone, and was probably built in the 11th century by a member of the Ulwartone family. The manor passed through a number of hands before being purchased by the Cavendish family in 1692. The estate then passed to the Dukes of Devonshire in 1711. The manor house was extensively remodelled by Duchess Henrietta Maria in the early 18th century, and later by Duke George Augustus Frederick in 1815. The Dukes of Devonshire continued to use the manor house until 1924, when it was sold to Lord Astor. Wolverton Manor later became a hotel and is now a Grade II* listed building.

St Luke's is a district in central London, England. Historically a part of the City of London, it is now mostly situated in the London Borough of Southwark.  The name "St Luke's" is thought to derive from the dedication of the church to Saint Luke, the patron saint of physicians. The first recorded use of the name was in 1199. The district originally consisted of a small number of houses around an open space known as St Lawrence Pountney, which was located south-east of Aldgate. The area developed in the 14th century when it came into possession of the Cluniac priory of St George, which built a convent and church on the site. In 1535, during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, St George's was demolished and its lands were divided between two wealthy citizens, Sir Richard Gresham and Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Gresham built his mansion on Howard's land, and called it Gresham Court.  In 1665, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, a Dutch fortress was established on Tower Hill and called Fort Amsterdam. The area became known as Gresham's Marsh after Sir Richard Gresham, who had been instrumental in its acquisition by the Crown. The district continued to expand in the 18th century when it came into possession of several churches: Christ Church (1712), St Andrew Undershaft (1725), and All Hallows-on-the-Wall (1739).

Jacob Hendrik Smit, CMG (3 September 1881 â€“ 22 July 1959) was a Southern Rhodesian merchant and politician. Born in the Netherlands, Smit migrated to Rhodesia and traded as a merchant, before becoming Southern Rhodesia's Minister of Finance in 1933. Orthodox in his economic policies, Smit resigned from Godfrey Huggins' government in 1942 and later formed the right-wing Liberal Party. He was Southern Rhodesia's Leader of the Opposition from 1946 to 1948, when he lost his seat. Biography  Smit was born in Hilversum, the Netherlands, the son of Samuel Marinus Smit and Aleyda Woutera van Wyland. Destined for a teaching career, he instead became a bank clerk, before migrating to the Transvaal around 1899. Failing to establish himself there, he went to Beira in 1900, working as a tobacconist, and thence to Salisbury in 1905, where at first he sold wares from a barrow, then a mule cart. Opening a grocery and hardware store in 1914, Smit's fortunes rose, and he became first a town councillor, then the Mayor of Salisbury from 1927 to 1928. He was naturalised as a British subject in 1926.

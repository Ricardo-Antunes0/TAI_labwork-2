The Armenian whiskered bat (Myotis hajastanicus), also known as the Hajastan myotis or the Armenian myotis, is a species of bat from the family Vespertilionidae. The Armenian whiskered bat was formerly included as a part of the whiskered bat, but was considered distinct in 2000 as a result of morphologic comparison. Taxonomy and etymology It was described as a new subspecies of the whiskered bat in 1939. In 2000, Benda and Tsytsulina published that it should be considered a full species based on its physical characteristics. In 2016, Dietz et al. argued that the Armenian whiskered bat was not morphologically or genetically distinct enough to be considered a full species; instead, they argued that it is synonymous with Myotis aurascens (which is itself sometimes considered synonymous with Myotis davidii). However, as of 2018 the Integrated Taxonomic Information System still considers the Armenian whiskered bat as a full species. Its species name "hajastanicus" means "of Hayastan," which is an alternate name for Armenia.

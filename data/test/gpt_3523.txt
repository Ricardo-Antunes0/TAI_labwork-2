Billroth II, more formally Billroth's operation II, is a surgical procedure used to correct a herniation of the dura mater, the tough outer layer of the brain.  The procedure is named after German neurosurgeon, Paul Billroth. It was first described and performed by Billroth in 1881.  The surgery is most commonly used to treat intracranial hypertension (ICH), a condition in which high pressure within the brain causes headaches, memory problems, and seizures. ICH is also a leading cause of death in young adults.  Billroth II is a minimally-invasive surgery that uses a small incision in the skull to remove the herniated dura mater. This prevents pressure from building up inside the brain and allows for better neurovascular circulation.  The surgery is usually successful in restoring normal brain function and reducing symptoms of ICH. There are, however, some risks associated with the surgery, including infection and damage to underlying brain structures.

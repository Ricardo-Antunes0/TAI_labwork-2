Military bands in the United Kingdom are a integral part of many armed forces, both active and reserve. The bands are usually made up of a brass band, a drum and bugle corps, and occasionally a military choir.  Military bands in the United Kingdom date back to the late 18th century. In 1794, the first military band was formed in England to provide music for marching troops. During the Napoleonic Wars, bands were formed specifically for military purposes, and during World War I, the British military bands played an important role in morale boosting campaigns across Europe.   Today, military bands play a vital role in supporting armed forces operations worldwide. They are often used to entertain troops on base and during deployments, and they have also been used in humanitarian missions across the world. Military bands in the United Kingdom are renowned for their high standards of musicianship and performance.

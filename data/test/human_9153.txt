Plot Jugni Chali Jalandhar is the story of the trials and tribulations of a girl who is madly in love with a guy from her college and will face any ordeal for him. Jasmeet, who is born and brought up in London, is a doctor. Sweet, stylish, modern, cultured and well-educated 'Jazz' falls for 'Vicky', who belongs to Gen 'Y' but is a Punjabi munda at heart. Although they love each other dearly, Vicky knows his father will never accept an educated girl as his 'Bahu', so he leaves Jasmeet in London and comes back to his native village Jagtariya in Jalandhar, Punjab. Since Jasmeet knows that the only way she can marry Vicky is by pleasing his dad, she goes to Jagtariya. Here unfortunately she bumps into her "father-in-law", who fumes at her when she throws at him a pound and runs away. He sends his sons to get hold of the 'Firangan' (foreigner) and vows to settle scores with her. When Vicky finds out that the Firangan is none other than Jasmeet, he somehow manages to save her from his brothers and asks her to go back. A disappointed Jasmeet was about to leave Jagtariya when she meets a woman with whom she shares her sorrow.

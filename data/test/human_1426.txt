The Zike, or Sinclair Zike, is a lightweight electric bicycle invented by Clive Sinclair and marketed by his company Sinclair Research Ltd in 1992. It was a commercial failure, selling only 2,000 units while originally intended to be produced at the rate of 10,000 a month. It was ended six months after introduction. Design The Sinclair Zike is a portable bicycle with a small electric motor driving the rear wheel and with batteries built into its frame. It weighs 11kg. The batteries fit inside the central shaft together with the motor. It uses nickel–cadmium batteries which have half the weight of the equivalent lead–acid batteries typical of 20th-century electric vehicles, and which can withstand 2000 recharging cycles. A three-position throttle placed under the right handlebar varies the electric power and thus the amount of pedaling required to keep going, although the Zike has only one gear. Battery life is said to be between 30 minutes and three hours depending on which of the three running speeds are used. The batteries can be fully recharged by plugging them into the mains for just one hour, and they are also recharged regeneratively using the energy from pedalling, freewheeling, and braking. The maximum speed of the bicycle operating under its own power was kept below 15 miles per hour to prevent it being classified as a motorcycle under UK law.

Arthur Joyce Lunel Cary (7 December 1888 – 21 September 1962) was an Irish author and playwright who wrote novels and short stories in both English and French. He is best known for his 1921 novel The Horse's Mouth, which was made into a successful film in 1937.  Born in Dublin, Cary was the son of a French father, Arthur Léonard Cary, and an Irish mother, Ellen (née O'Keefe). After studying at Trinity College, Dublin and the Sorbonne, he worked as a journalist in London before moving to Paris in 1913. There he began writing novels in both English and French and became associated with the literary group known as the Lost Generation. He returned to Ireland in 1939, living there until his death.  Cary is recognised as one of the most important writers of the 1920s and 1930s. His works include the novels The Horse's Mouth (1921), The Razor's Edge (1934), and Lord Jim (1936), as well as the short story collections Dubliners (1915), A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916), Tales of the South Pacific (1927), and The Rocking Chair (1929).

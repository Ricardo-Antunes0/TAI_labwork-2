The Battle of Waxhaws (also known as the Battle of Hayes Mill) was a battle fought on October 7, 1881, in the Waxhaws region of North Carolina between the Confederate States Army and a Union cavalry force commanded by Major General Alfred Pleasonton.  The Union cavalry force was attempting to raid a Confederate supply depot at Hayes Mill when they were met by a Confederate force numbering 3,000 men under the command of Major General Wade Hampton. The Union cavalry was quickly routed, with only 100 men making it back to their lines.

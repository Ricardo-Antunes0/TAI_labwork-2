Spalding Moor is a moor (in the county of Lincolnshire) in the North East England. The moor is 155 hectares in size and is bordered by the villages of Spalding and Kirby Wiske to the south, Grantham to the east, and Stamford to the north.  The moor was used for grazing by the monks of Waltham Abbey from the 10th century until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. In 1640, during the English Civil War, a Royalist army was defeated on Spalding Moor by a Parliamentarian force led by Sir Thomas Fairfax. The moor is now managed by English Heritage as a nature reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest.  The moor is characterised by its low-lying heathland, which is interspersed with small coniferous woodlands. There are also areas of rough grassland, marshes and ponds. The moor is home to a number of rare plant species, including heath-sedge and dwarf birch. The moor is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest for its Orchids.

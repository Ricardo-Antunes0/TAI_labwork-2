Henri Duvernois (4 March 1875 in Paris – 1 November 1952 in Paris) was a French historian, specialist in Ancient Rome and the Renaissance. A professor at the University of Paris and the author of many scholarly works, he was also a member of the Académie française.  Duvernois was born into a family of minor nobility. After studying at the Lycée Henri IV and then at the University of Paris (where he obtained his degree in 1898), he attended the École pratique des hautes études from 1899 to 1902, where he met Émile Durkheim. He then became assistant professor at the University of Paris, and in 1913 he moved to the University of Rome where he remained until his retirement in 1945.  His work on Ancient Rome and Renaissance history has been highly influential, and his writings on topics such as Cicero, Machiavelli, Michelangelo, and Petrarch have been translated into many languages. Duvernois was a member of the Académie française from 1935 until his death.

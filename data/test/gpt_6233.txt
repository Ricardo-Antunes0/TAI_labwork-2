The Hyades (; Greek Ὑάδες, also known as the Seven Sisters, Pleiades, or the Queen of the Stars) are a star cluster located in the northern hemisphere near the celestial equator. The cluster is visible to the naked eye, having an apparent magnitude of 3.4. With an estimated diameter of 150 light years, it is one of the smallest star clusters known.  The Hyades are believed to have been first observed by astronomer Ptolemy in 150 BC. He named them after the daughters of Atlas, who were said to have congregated there. The cluster was later included by Johannes Hevelius in his 1751 atlas, and by Charles Messier in his 1764 catalogue of nebulous objects.  The Hyades are composed of about 100 stars that are between 1 million and 2 million years old. It is located about 4,000 light years from Earth.

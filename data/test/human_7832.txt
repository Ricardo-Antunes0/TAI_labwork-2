Philip Charles Testa (April 21, 1924 â€“ March 15, 1981), also known as "The Chicken Man", was an American mobster known for his brief leadership of the Philadelphia crime family. He became boss after Angelo Bruno was murdered by his own consigliere, Antonio Caponigro, who, in turn, was ordered killed by The Commission for acting without permission. Testa's nickname came from his involvement in a poultry business. About a year after Bruno's death, Testa was killed by the blast of a nail bomb allegedly ordered by his underboss, Peter Casella. Early life Testa was born to Sicilian immigrants in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and lived in South Philadelphia with his family in his teenage years. In South Philadelphia he met and befriended future mob boss Angelo Bruno. He later married Alfia Arcidiacono (records show her family owned a farm in Salem County, New Jersey). In early police dossiers on Testa, he was identified by law enforcement as not having a legitimate source of income and was solely dependent from winnings as a "common gambler."

Developmental robotics (DevRob), sometimes called epigenetic robotics, is a field of research that studies how robots can be designed to change and adapt as they interact with their environment.  One of the key goals of DevRob is to enable robots to learn and evolve autonomously, in a way that is similar to how humans learn and evolve. This can be done by designing robots that can process and use data gathered from their surroundings, as well as modify their own behaviour based on this data.  Another goal of DevRob is to create robotic systems that are able to interact with people and other creatures in a natural way. This could involve building robots that are able to understand human gestures, expressions, and emotions, as well as responding in a way that is both meaningful and appropriate for the situation.  Overall, DevRob seeks to create devices and systems that are both intelligent and adaptable, which will ultimately help to improve the quality of life for both people and robots alike.

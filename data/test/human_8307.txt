Hans Klumbach (26 April 1904 – 14 December 1992) was a German archaeologist and scholar of classical and provincial Roman studies. He served as a curator at, and later the director of, the Romano-Germanic Central Museum. His 1973 work Spätrömische Gardehelme laid bare the relationship between the late Roman ridge helmets and the later Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon crested helmets. Early life and education Hans Klumbach was born on 26 April 1904 in Wolfach, in the German district of Ortenaukreis. He grew up in Stuttgart, where he attended the Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium. From 1922 until 1927, when he obtained a Ph.D. under the supervision of Carl Watzinger, Klumbach studied at the University of Tübingen and Heidelberg University. After leaving school Klumbach embarked on a travel scholarship awarded by the German Archaeological Institute, after which he worked as a scientific assistant for the institute in Rome and Athens. Klumbach served in the military from 1940 to 1947 including during World War II, for part of which time he was imprisoned.

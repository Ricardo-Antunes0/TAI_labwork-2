The Calves Head Club was purportedly established to ridicule the memory of Charles I of England. Toward the end of the seventeenth century, rumors began circulating in print about the club and its annual meeting held on 30 January, the anniversary of the execution of Charles I by decapitation. The club is mentioned by Samuel Wesley, a dissenter who later conformed to the Anglican Church, in the anonymous A Letter from a Country Divine to his Friend in London Concerning the Education of Dissenters in their Private Academies (1703). Wesley claimed to have attended  a meeting in 1693 where dissenters blasphemed the memory of Charles I, "discoursing of their Calves-head Club" and a "Design they had at their next Calves-Head Feast, to have a Cold Pye serv'd on the Table, with either a Live-Cat or Hare ... and they had contriv'd to put one of their Company who lov'd Monarchy, and knew nothing of the matter, to cut it up; whereupon, and on the leaping out of the Cat or Hare, they were all to set up a Shout, and cry, Haloo! Old Puss!â€”to the Honour of the Good Old Cause, and to shew their affection to a Commonwealth." Wesley's biographer Henry D. Rack comments, "It was probably not, as is usually claimed, a meeting of the so-called Calve's Head Club, whose reputation in any case may owe much to tory propaganda. ... Publication was timed to reinforce the current attacks on dissenters and especially on their academies."

Adam Willis is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Ian Williams. He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 9 August 1990. Williams was cast in the role in early 1990, but did not start filming until June because he had work commitments to another television project. News outlets claimed producers cast Williams to replace former fan-favourite cast members, a claim the actor found insulting. He is introduced as the eldest child of Doug (Terence Donovan) and Pam Willis (Sue Jones). He is characterised as a studious medical student who does not want to follow his father's example of working on a building site. He is Pam's favourite child and she has high hopes for his medical career. Writers devised romance stories for the character alongside fellow newly introduced characters Caroline Alessi (Gillian Blakeney) and Gemma Ramsay (Beth Buchanan). Williams liked his role in the show but had issues with Adam's naivety.

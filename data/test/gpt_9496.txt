Vignoles is a complex hybrid wine grape variety, created by crossing the two French wine grape varieties Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. The resulting grape is a cross between the two parent varieties, giving it a characteristic taste and aroma of both.  Vignoles is a versatile grape variety that can be used to make both dry and sweet wine. It is a good choice for blending, as its flavor profile and acidity blend well with other grapes. Vignoles is also known for its high sugar content, which helps to make complex wines.

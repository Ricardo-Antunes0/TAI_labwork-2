Clinical pluralism is a term used by psychiatrists to describe the diversity of psychiatric practice. This diversity can be seen in the different medications that are prescribed, the different psychotherapy methods that are used, and the different diagnosis labels that are assigned. The term was first coined by psychiatrist David Rosenhan in 1973, and has since been used to describe the phenomenon of psychiatrists practicing different forms of psychiatry without any clear evidence that one approach is better than another.  Clinical pluralism can lead to confusion for patients, as they may not know which form of psychiatry to seek help from. It can also lead to conflict between psychiatrists, as they may disagree on which diagnosis or treatment should be given to a patient. However, clinical pluralism is not always negative. It can lead to greater variety and understanding of psychiatric practice, and it can allow for new approaches to be developed.

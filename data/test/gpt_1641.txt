The Heraion of Samos was a large sanctuary in Ancient Greece dedicated to Hera, the goddess of marriage and motherhood. The sanctuary was located on the island of Samos, near the city of Mytilene.  The Heraion was constructed in the 6th century BC on the site of a small sanctuary that had been dedicated to Hera since the 6th century BC. The sanctuary was enlarged several times over the centuries, reaching its present size by the end of the 4th century BC. It was destroyed by an earthquake in AD 1253.  The Heraion was a large sanctuary with several circular altars and an open-air theatre. It was surrounded by a colonnade of Ionic columns. The interior of the temple was decorated with reliefs depicting religious scenes from Greek mythology. The most famous relief is the Metopes from the Parthenon Frieze, which is now in the British Museum.

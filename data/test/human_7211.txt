WGMM is an AM radio station licensed to the city of Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania and is part of the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre radio market. It broadcasts on a frequency of 1460 kHz with 5,000 watts daytime, and 1,000 watts nighttime power with a directional signal. The station simulcasts with WGMF (730 AM) in Nanticoke. The WGMM-WGMF studio is located on Wilmar Drive in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania. As WEMR, it formerly simulcast the adult contemporary format aired by its sister station, WCOZ, now KZ104, in neighboring Sullivan County, but now airs a classic hits format. The station identifies itself primarily by its translators at 104.3 and 104.5Â MHz, hence the name "Gem 104". History WGMM's beginnings trace back to the mid-1980s, when a consortium of eight local businessmen pooled their resources to form Endless Mountain Broadcasting. There was no radio station on the air at that time serving Tunkhannock or Wyoming County, and the rugged mountainous terrain often inhibited weaker radio signals from surrounding markets. One of the owner principals for Endless Mountain Broadcasting was Don Sherwood, a Tunkhannock Chevrolet dealer who would go on to pursue a career in politics, leading him to a congressional seat that he would hold from 1999 to 2007. Sherwood and Norman Werkheiser , founder and president of Keystone Caps, a truck camper top manufacturing company, were the two majority shareholders in the company.

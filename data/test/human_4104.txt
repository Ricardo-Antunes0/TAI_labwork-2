Caja Laboral Popular Cooperativa de Crédito or Caja Laboral (Workers' Credit Union) was a Spanish credit union established in 1959 as part of the Mondragon Corporation and headquartered in Mondragón, in the Basque Country of Spain. The major financial provider behind the Basque cooperative movement, Caja Laboral covers the financial segment of Mondragon and provides banking and financial services to its customers through a network of over 370 branch offices in the Basque Country and beyond. With over 1800 employees - who are actually the partners-owners of the bank following the cooperative philosophy of shared ownership and stewardship - Caja Laboral generates annual revenue in excess of €330 million. Together with its sister social assurance company Lagun Aro, Caja Laboral spearheaded the Financial Group of the Mondragon Corporation, which according to company sources 'operates autonomously within the framework of a sole joint strategy'. It was the first Spanish financial institution to open its branches in the late afternoons/early evenings.

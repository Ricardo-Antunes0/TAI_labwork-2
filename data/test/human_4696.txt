Sakowitz was a chain of family-owned department stores based in Houston, Texas, United States. The store was founded by two brothers, Tobias and Simon Sakowitz, in Galveston, Texas in 1902.  Other family members were working in the cotton mills in Galveston.  The two brothers, Simon and Tobias, began a peddler business, taking orders and delivering clothes on a bicycle to the many merchant seamen in Galveston at that time. Eventually, the chain expanded to thirteen locations, of which ten were in Texas. L. J. Hooker, an Australian retail development firm, purchased the Sakowitz chain in 1988 so that a location could be opened at Forest Fair Mall (now Forest Fair Village) in Forest Park, Ohio and Fairfield, Ohio. Due, in part, to the fact that Cincinnati was an untested market, the mall straddled two counties (Hamilton and Butler) and that the Australian real estate market tanked, Forest Fair Mall failed. The location of the complex was also in a very middle-class area and having both high and low end stores reside in the same mall proved to be too much.

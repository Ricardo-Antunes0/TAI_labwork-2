Norman Haire, born Norman Zions (21 January 1892, Sydney â€“ 11 September 1952, London) was an Australian medical practitioner and sexologist. He has been called "the most prominent sexologist in Britain" between the wars. Life When Norman was born in 1892 his parents, Henry and Clara Zions, were living in Sydney at 255 Oxford Street, Paddington.  He was their unplanned and unwanted, 11th and final child.  He was a star debater at Fort Street High School but his plans to be an actor were thwarted when his parents made him study medicine.  He was anxious about his sexuality as a teenager (i.e., he was homosexual), but his chance discovery of Havelock Ellis' Studies in the Psychology of Sex in Sydney's public library made him decide that he, like Ellis, would devote his life to saving people from sexual misery.  He graduated in 1915 from the University of Sydney, and worked in several obstetric and mental health hospitals before his appointment as Medical Superintendent at Newcastle Hospital at the time of the influenza pandemic.  When a patient died, Zions was unjustly held responsible  and, shortly after, left his homeland for twenty years.

Malbis Memorial Church, formally the Sacred Patriarchal and Stavropegial Monastery of the Presentation of Theotokos, is a Greek Orthodox Church located in Malbis, Baldwin County, Alabama. One of roughly six Greek Orthodox churches in the state of Alabama, it is not a part of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, but is instead directly under the authority of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. It is known for its intricate and extensive mosaics and paintings. The church was officially dedicated on January 3, 1965, and the opening service for the church was conducted by Archbishop Iakovos of America.  It has never had an active congregation, but religious observances, special services, and events, such as weddings, do take place.  It was listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on November 30, 1977.  The Malbis Plantation Historic District, which includes the church, was designated by the Alabama Historical Commission in 2008, a year that also saw the death of the last of Malbis Plantation's original Greek settlers. History The history of the church at Malbis begins with the foundation of Malbis Plantation by Jason Malbis, a Greek immigrant.  Born Antonios Markopoulos in the settlement of Doumena, he spent the first half of his life in a monastery.  He initially emigrated to Chicago around 1900.  He changed his name to Malbis while there and then, along with one of his friends, William Papageorge, he traveled around the country in search of a place to establish a Greek community.  They purchased  near Daphne, Alabama in 1906 at $5 per acre. This formed the nucleus of Malbis Plantation.

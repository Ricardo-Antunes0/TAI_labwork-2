Buckland is a village and civil parish in the borough of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, England.  The parish, which also includes the village of Laverton, had a population of 225 in 2010.  The village is close to the Worcestershire border and  south of Broadway. East of the village is the Burhill Iron Age hillfort. To the south, and within Buckland Parish, is the hamlet of Laverton. Within the village itself is the medieval Church of St Michael, a seventeenth-century manor house, and what claims to be the oldest Rectory in England. Hill Fort Burhill hillfort occupies a spur on the Cotswold escarpment, overlooking Buckland and the Severn/Avon valley. Very little remains of any ramparts, except for a stretch on the eastern side, against the slope of the scarp, indicating an entranceway. The site was only identified as a hillfort in 1960. An area of some  may have been enclosed, but on most sides the natural scarp is now the only remaining defensive feature. The whole area has been extensively ploughed, and within the hillfort a scatter of early to mid iron-age pottery has turned up. An area outside the fort, east of the entrance, has produced much greater quantities of pottery dating to the earliest period of the Iron Age, with many fragments of various jars and bowls.

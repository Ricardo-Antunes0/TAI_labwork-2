Self-perception theory (SPT) is an account of how individuals perceive themselves. It began as a set of hypotheses about how people think about themselves and their abilities, but has since been developed into a comprehensive theory of self-concept.  SPT posits that self-perception is the result of two processes: self-evaluation and self-monitoring. Self-evaluation refers to the process by which individuals evaluate their own competence, worth, and attractiveness. Self-monitoring refers to the process by which individuals monitor their own performance in order to make adjustments or updates to their self-evaluation.  Together, these two processes create an individual's self-concept. Self-concept is a comprehensive representation of an individual's identity that includes their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. It is central to our sense of self and can have a significant impact on our overall well-being.  SPT has been influential in the fields of psychology and gender studies, as it has helped to shed light on how individuals perceive themselves and how this affects their behaviour. It has also been used to develop interventions targeting self-perceptions in areas such as depression and social anxiety disorder.

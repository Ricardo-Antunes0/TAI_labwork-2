The Organ Mountains (also known as La Sierra de los Órganos) are a rugged mountain range in southern New Mexico in the Southwestern United States. Organ Mountains–Desert Peaks National Monument was declared a national monument on May 21, 2014.  They lie  east of the city of Las Cruces, in Doña Ana County. Geography The Organ Mountains are near the southern end of a long line of mountains on the east side of the Rio Grande's rift valley.  The range is nearly contiguous with the San Andres Mountains to the north and the Franklin Mountains to the south, but is very different geologically.  Whereas the San Andres and Franklin Mountains are both formed from west-dipping fault blocks of mostly sedimentary strata (with limestone most prominent), the Organ Mountains are made primarily of igneous rock (intrusive granite and extrusive rhyolite).  Their name reflects their similarity in appearance (particularly the granite "needles" in the highest part of the range) with pipes that would be part of a pipe organ.

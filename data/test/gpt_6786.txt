The geology of Alderney includes similarities in its rocks and soils to those of the Channel Islands, which are also situated near the French coast. The Alderney granite, which makes up the island's most prominent feature, was created about 2.6 billion years ago. The island's other major rock type is the gneiss. The soils are mainly clay and sand, with a small amount of limestone.   The island is divided into three main areas: the central plateau, the west coast, and the east coast. The central plateau is made up of granite and gneiss, while the west coast is mostly composed of schist and limestone. The eastern coast is made up of sandstone and shale. There are several active volcanoes on Alderney, including Mount Rowan and Mont Saint-Michel.   The climate on Alderney is maritime, with a milder winter than mainland France. The average annual temperature is around 18 degrees Celsius, while the average annual rainfall is around 800 mm.

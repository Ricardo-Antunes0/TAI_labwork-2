San Venerio Lighthouse  is an active lighthouse on the island of Tino, in the comune of Porto Venere in the Province of La Spezia, Liguria, Italy. Its construction began in 1839, and completed in 1840. It illuminates and guides the sailors in that part of Ligurian Sea. It is named for Venerius the Hermit, the patron saint of lighthouse keepers. History  San Venerio Lighthouse is a fortified neoclassical building, despite having undergone many changes over time. Construction of the lighthouse was granted by King Charles Albert of Savoy and was initially fueled by vegetable oil, followed later by coal. In 1884 another tower was built, taller than the original at  high, and at the top of the lenses an optical filament was added, electrically powered by two steam engines. This system gave too much power to the beam of light, and in 1912 the fuel was replaced with petroleum. The lighthouse was later electrified, and became fully automated in 1985.

Winibald (Winebald, Winnibald, Wunebald, Wynbald) (c. 702 â€“ before 718) was a Frankish count and bishop of Metz.  Winibald was the son of a count named Walafrid and a sister of the future king Pippin I. He is first mentioned in 714, when he was captured by the Muslim forces of Abd al-Rahman I at the Battle of Tours. He was eventually released and made bishop of Metz in 720 by Pippin. In 725 he accompanied his brother on an expedition to Italy, where they unsuccessfully attempted to intervene in the Lombard Wars.  Winibald died before 718 and was buried at the cathedral at Metz.

Amud 1 is a nearly complete but as yet unnamed early Bronze Age city in the territory of modern-day Iraq. Located in the Tigris-Euphrates valley, it has been dated to approximately 3200 BC.  Amud 1 was first discovered in 1898 by the British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans, who named it after the god Amurru. The city was excavated from 1899 to 1907 by a team under the direction of Evans, and was further explored by the German archaeologist Ludwig Borchardt between 1910 and 1914. Its remains are currently located near the town of Ain Sukhna, about northeast of Baghdad.  The city is notable for its well-preserved ruins, which include a large palace compound with several hundred rooms, an extensive aqueduct system, and a number of smaller settlements. The city's inhabitants may have been primarily agriculturalists and traders, with significant trade links to neighboring cities and regions. Amud 1 is one of the few ancient urban centres to have been discovered in Iraq and one of the earliest known examples of a planned city in the Middle East.

Wolf and Leopards (later issued as Wolves and Leopards) is a book by English naturalist George Ord. It was first published in 1948 and is a natural history study of the interactions between wolves and leopards.  The book is divided into three parts. The first part discusses the comparative behaviour of both species, the second part focuses on the hunting habits of both predators, and the third part looks at the consequences of these interactions on their respective populations.

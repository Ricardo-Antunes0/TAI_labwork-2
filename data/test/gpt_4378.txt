Mountain bike trials, also known as observed trials or hill climb trials, is a type of bicycle racing where riders race up a hill, usually a set distance of around 500 metres, as many times as possible within a time limit.   The sport is most popular in Europe, but has also become popular in North America. The sport is growing in popularity in Asia.  Mountain bike trials can be divided into two categories: downhill and cross-country. Downhill trials are shorter and involve racing up a hill towards the finish line. Cross-country trials are longer and involve riding around a course that includes both hills and flat sections.

Mahwelereng is a township in the Mogalakwena Local Municipality of the Waterberg District Municipality of the Limpopo Province of South Africa. It is about 2Â km from Mokopane. The township is a product of Apartheid South Africa's policies in the former Bantustan of Lebowa. Most of the original residents of Mahwelereng were from an area which old residents call "Ol' Location". Ol' Location was too close to town and the residents had to be moved further away from town. There are still remnants of Ol' Location such as the "Bar" and the Lutheran Church Mission on the Sekgakgapeng site. The township is bordered by Sekgakgapeng, Mountainview, Moshate, Phola Park and Ga-Madiba. Background The township grew rapidly as a result of urbanisation, as it afforded job opportunities in an area largely surrounded by rural settlements. The lack of affordable housing stock has also led to an increase in informal housing. The name Mahwelereng (meaning place of Mohwelere trees) is derived from the name of a tree referred to in the Northern Sotho language as "Mohwelere".

Backpack journalism, also called backpack reporting, is a form of journalism that relies on portable digital tools and data to report on the news. Backpack journalists often work as freelancers or in short-term contracts, traveling to where the story is happening.  Backpack journalism has been criticized for its lack of accuracy and its reliance on quick sources. However, backpack journalists are often able to provide a unique perspective on events that traditional journalists may not be able to get to. Backpack journalism has also been used to cover disasters and humanitarian crises, helping to provide a more complete picture of what is happening.

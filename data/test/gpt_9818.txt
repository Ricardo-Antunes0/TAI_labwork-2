Nicholas Albert Reale (March 20, 1922 – December 9, 2006) was an American composer and pianist.  Reale was born in Newark, New Jersey, to Nicholas Reale and his wife, the violinist and music educator Ida (née Margolis). He studied at the Juilliard School of Music in New York City with Rosina Lhévinne and Darius Milhaud. He also studied privately with Arnold Schoenberg.  Reale's early compositions were influenced by Olivier Messiaen, Igor Stravinsky, and Arnold Schoenberg. In the 1950s and 1960s, he explored avant-garde compositional methods such as serialism and aleatoricism. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he composed more conventional works that incorporated tonality.  Reale's notable students include John Adams, Quincy Jones, Michael Tilson Thomas, George Crumb, David Lang, Christopher Rouse and David Diamond. He served on the faculties of the Yale School of Music (1952–1974), Columbia University (1974–1982), and the Juilliard School (1982–2006).  Nicholas Albert Reale died on December 9, 2006 in Purchase, New York at the age of 86.

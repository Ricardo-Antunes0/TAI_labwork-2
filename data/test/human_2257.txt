Samuel C. Hughes (August 28, 1829 â€“ June 20, 1917) was a Welsh-born American businessman and politician. He was one of the first people to move to Arizona for health reasons. After his arrival, he became one of Tucson's leading citizens and the brother-in-law and business partner to Arizona Territorial delegate Hiram S. Stevens. Background Hughes was born in Pembrokeshire, Wales on August 28, 1829. His siblings included Arizona Governor L. C. Hughes. His family immigrated to the United States in 1837, settling near Allegheny City, Pennsylvania. The death of his parents forced him to enter the workforce at a young age.  While Hughes' formal education consisted of three days of school room instruction, he learned a variety of skills while working. His early employment included positions as a factory worker, canal boat pilot, and apprentice baker before becoming a cabin boy on a steamboat in 1848. Two years later, working as a cook to pay his way, Hughes traveled from St. Joseph, Missouri to Hangtown, California.

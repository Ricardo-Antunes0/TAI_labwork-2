Edward George Glover (13 January 1888 â€“ 28 July 1959) was a British psychoanalyst, known for his work with patients suffering from schizophrenia.  Glover was born in 1888 in London, the son of a Dutch immigrant. After attending schools in Hackney and London, he studied medicine at University College, London. He served as a medical officer in the British Army during World War I, and after the war worked as a doctor in East London.  In 1923, Glover began working as a psychoanalyst with patients suffering from schizophrenia. He developed a technique known as "psychodynamic interpretation", which focused on the underlying psychological roots of the patient's symptoms. Glover remained active as a psychoanalyst until his death in 1959.

Lisa "Duffy" Duffin is a fictional character from the BBC medical drama Casualty, played by Cathy Shipton. Duffy was created by Jeremy Brock and Paul Unwin as one of the serial's ten original characters. Shipton received her audition just as she was thinking of giving up her acting career. She thought her chances of being cast were slim, as she had on bandages following a fall, however, producer Geraint Morris was fascinated by the incident and asked her about her time in the hospital. Shipton was initially considered for the role of receptionist Susie Mercier, before being cast as Duffy. She made her debut in the pilot episode of the first series, broadcast on 6 September 1986. Duffy is characterised as a "tough" and "carefree" nurse. She has a distinct style with her hair pinned up and wears neatly ironed uniforms. Shipton has stated that Duffy became more confident as the years progressed. The character has been used to portray various issue led stories. First, she became the victim of sexual assault, which caused her to lose her "happy go lucky" persona. Shipton later recalled that it was her most harrowing story. Next, she had an HIV scare following the breakdown of her relationship with Peter Tranter (Eric Deacon).

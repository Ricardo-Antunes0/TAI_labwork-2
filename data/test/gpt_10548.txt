Forti Corse, commonly known as Forti, was a Formula 1 constructor who participated in 116 Grands Prix, debuting in 1985. The team was founded by Enzo Ferrari, and was initially run by his son, Piero, before being sold to the Benetton family in 1988. Forti finished third in the Constructors' Championship twice (1990 and 1991), and also took two fourth-place finishes. The team was sold to Renault for $120 million in 1994.  Forti achieved their only Formula One victory at the 1995 Monaco Grand Prix with Giancarlo Fisichella driving. However, following the 1996 season Renault withdrew from Formula One, unable to find a title sponsor for the team. Forti filed for bankruptcy in 1997 and ceased operations.

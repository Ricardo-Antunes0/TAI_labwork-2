The  is an Edo period seawall  on the Kii Channel coast in what is now part of the town of Hirogawa, Wakayama, Japan. It was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1938. It was built by Hamaguchi Goryō after the 1854 Ansei-Nankai earthquake and continued to protect the town against the tsunami of the 1946 Nankai earthquake. Overview The village of Hiro is located at the innermost part of Yuasa Bay and has been severely damaged by tsunami since ancient times. During the Muromachi period, in 1399, a stone wall was constructed by the Hatakeyama clan who ruled this portion of Kii Province as a measure against tsunami. This stone wall was approximately 2.7 meters high with a length of 400 meters, and portions (now reinforced with concrete]] remain in use to this day. Protection afforded by this seawall was one of the factors which led to the prosperity of the village. However, a tsunami caused by the 1605 Keichō earthquake breached this ancient defense and caused severe damage. In response, Tokugawa Yorinobu, ruler of Kishū Domain, ordered the construction of a new seawall. Called the "Wada Ishitsutsumi", it was constructed from 1661 to 1673 and was approximately 218 meters long. It protected ships from high tides, and Hiro Village flourished as a relay port. However, this seawall was breached by the tsunami of the 1707 Hōei earthquake, which devastated Hiro village, destroying 850 buildings and killing 192 persons. The wall was rebuilt by 1802, but was frequently damaged by storms and smaller tsunami, and requests for its repair were often ignored by the financially-strapped Kishū Domain.

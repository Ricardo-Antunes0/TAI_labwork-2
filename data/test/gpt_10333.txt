Hatzegopteryx ("Hațeg basin wing") is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous Period, about 112 to 107 million years ago.  The type and only known species is Hatzegopteryx thambeti. It was first described by German paleontologist Ernst Stromer in 1876. The genus name is derived from the Greek haṭzege meaning "hatch" or "crack" and pteryx meaning "wing", referring to the distinctive wing-like protrusions on its tail. Hatzegopteryx was first thought to be a member of the Ornithomimidae, but later research found it to be a relative of the Maniraptoriformes, making it the most basal member of that group. Hatzegopteryx is one of the earliest known birds, and is one of the few known dinosaurs that can plausibly be considered a flying animal.  Hatzegopteryx was a medium-sized ornithomimid, measuring up to long and weighing around . It had a long, thin neck and a small head with a deep socket for its brain. Its arms were short and its hands were equipped with three finger claws. The wings were large, covering most of its body when extended, and may have been used for flight or for balance while running. Hatzegopteryx had a long tail with several prominent wing-like protrusions at the end.  Hatzeg

The Lockheed MQM-105 Aquila (Eagle) was the replacement for the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle in the United States Air Force's inventory. The Aquila was designed to improve upon the features of the Eagle while reducing development and manufacturing costs.  The Aquila entered service in 2013 with the USAF, replacing the aging F-15E Strike Eagle fleet. The Aquila is a twin-engine, all-weather aircraft that is designed to perform close air support, air interdiction, and reconnaissance missions. The aircraft is equipped with a wide array of sensors and weapons systems, including an advanced helmet-mounted display system and a precision-guided munitions capability.  The Aquila is scheduled to be replaced by the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II in the 2020s.

Padbury railway station served the village of Padbury in the English county of Buckinghamshire. It opened in 1878 as part of the Buckinghamshire Railway's branch line to Verney Junction which provided connections to Banbury,  and  and closed in 1964. History The Buckinghamshire Railway's line from Banbury to Verney Junction opened to passengers on 1 May 1850. It had been originally planned to provide a station to serve the Buckinghamshire village of Padbury at a projected cost of Â£3,000  but this did not materialise, possibly as a result of necessary economies. It was not until 1 March 1878 that a station was opened at Padbury. The London and North Western Railway, which had worked the line from its opening and which absorbed the Buckinghamshire Railway in 1879, advised the Board of Trade in January 1878 that a station was being built at Padbury and that a siding had been laid to facilitate construction. The points to the siding were locked and an Annett's key was held by the  stationmaster from whom it had to be collected and returned after each working to the siding.

Al Furjan is an upscale neighbourhood, gated community, and property development in the Jebel Ali district, Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Nakheel Properties heads the development and Azizi Developments owns the largest number of residential buildings. It borders Jebel Ali Village and is near Ibn Battuta Mall, the Gardens, and the site of the Expo 2020, which is one of its major draws. Sheikh Zayed Road and Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Road are also very accessible from the community. Homes in Al Furjan are typically built in Al Hejaz (inspired by traditional Arabic architecture), Dubai (local architectural style), or Quortaj (Islamic/Mediterranean architecture) styles. In addition to constructions from Nakheel and Azizi, Al Furjan also features buildings by Danube Properties, Ghreiwati Properties, Al Jaziri Brothers, Seen Real Estate Developers, Jag Development, Meilenstein Real Estate Development, CPL Real Estate Development, Invest Group Overseas, MAG Property Development, Diamond Real Estate Developers, and Wasl Properties.

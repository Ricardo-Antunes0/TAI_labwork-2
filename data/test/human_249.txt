Peter Pianto (25 November 1929 â€“ 19 February 2008) was an Australian rules footballer who played for the Geelong Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL) and the Claremont Football Club in the West Australian National Football League (WANFL) and later coached Geelong, replacing teammate Bob Davis.  Pianto was a brilliant rover who was recruited from Eaglehawk and he chose to join Geelong because of its country atmosphere, after having offers from four league clubs. He played 121 games and kicked 144 goals over seven years with the Cats, mainly playing as a rover and he was a premiership player with Geelong in 1951 and 1952. One of his most memorable efforts was his career high five goal performance in the 1953 semi final against Collingwood. During his career Pianto was a best and fairest winner, All-Australian and Victorian interstate representative. He polled well in the Brownlow Medal counts, finishing fourth in 1952 and second in 1956.

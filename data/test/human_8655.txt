Citizen of Glass is the third studio album by Danish singer-songwriter Agnes Obel, released on 21 October 2016 by PIAS Recordings. Four tracks were selected as singles: "Familiar", "Golden Green", "It's Happening Again", and "Stretch Your Eyes". Obel launched a European tour at the end of October 2016, followed by a North American tour in February 2017. Background On this album, Obel evokes the German concept of Gläserner Bürger, the "citizen of glass", as the guiding thread of the album, a citizen whose body and life are known to everyone. She discovered this term during her previous tour, while reading the news about the Edward Snowden case and citizen surveillance. Questions of transparency and privacy are themes that inspired her, forcing her to think about what she reveals of herself in her music. She worked on the concept of "glass" to create new songs, particularly by adding new instruments to her repertoire such as the trautonium, a rare instrument from the late 1920s whose crystalline sounds are reminiscent of glass.

Ghetto benches (known in Polish as getto benches) are benches typically found in poor, predominantly African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods in the United States. First used in the early 20th century in American cities with large African-American and Hispanic populations, they are often located near bus stops, parks, and other public areas to provide an inexpensive place to sit.  Ghetto benches are often the only place where people of color can sit together, and they have been identified as a focal point of social interaction and community building in these areas. They are also seen as a symbol of struggle and resilience by the people who use them.  Due to their location and use, ghetto benches are often targets of vandalism and theft. In some cases, they have been burned down or damaged beyond repair. Despite this, many people continue to use them because they find them to be invaluable resources for socializing and community building.

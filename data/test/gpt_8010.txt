It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 2 April 1993.  The Captain Tench Arcade is a well-preserved example of a Brisbane arcade, and is one of the few remaining examples dating from the early 20th century. The arcade was designed by James Fenton and built in 1906. It is one of the few remaining examples of an early 20th century arcade in Brisbane, and is an important part of Queensland's cultural heritage.  The arcade is located on the corner of Elizabeth and Ann Streets, within walking distance of the city centre. The arcade is a single storey rendered masonry building with a hipped roof. The facade is symmetrical and consists of a central entrance flanked by two projecting sections, one on each side. The entrance features a pedimented architrave and Corinthian pilasters supporting a triangular pediment with a carved relief depicting a sailing ship flanked by dolphins.  The interior features polished timber floors, plaster walls and ceilings, and elaborate plaster decorations including rococo style wall panels and a carved barrel ceiling. The arcade originally included 15 gaming machines, including several pinball machines. The arcade closed in 1984 due to declining patronage, but has since been renovated and re-opened as an entertainment venue known as "Tench".

Champlain's Dream: The European Founding of North America  In 1615, Champlain sailed up the St. Lawrence River and founded Quebec on the site of a former Native American village. The following year, he explored the upper reaches of the river where he discovered a large inland sea. In his journal, Champlain wrote of a dream in which he saw a great white city on an island in the sea. He believed that this was the fabled city of Atlantis, and he named the island Quebec in honour of the French king, Charles IX.  Champlain's Dream has inspired generations of explorers and writers. It has been used as a source of inspiration for novels and films, including The Lost World and The Mummy. Today, Quebec City is the capital of Canada, and Montreal is its largest city.

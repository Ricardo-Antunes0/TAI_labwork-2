Ethirostoma interpolata is a moth in the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1922. It is found in Brazil and Peru. The wingspan is about 9Â mm. The forewings are brownish fuscous, the tips of the scales minutely whitish, forming a very fine transverse striation. There are dark fuscous dots towards the costa near the base and at one-fifth and one-third, and two above and below the fold at one-fourth. The stigmata are dark fuscous, the plical rather obliquely before the first discal. There is a gradually expanded streak of dark fuscous suffusion along the costa from one-third to the subterminal line, cut by an oblique white strigula from the middle of the costa. There is also a nearly straight whitish line from four-fifths of the costa to the tornus, hardly angulated in the middle, beyond the angle a short black dash, sometimes a second more minute indicated beneath it. The hindwings are dark grey.

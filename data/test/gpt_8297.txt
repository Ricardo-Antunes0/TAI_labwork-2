The Helles clan is a Palestinian extended family from the town of Helles in the governorate of Ramallah and al-Bireh in the West Bank. The clan is made up of approximately 2,000 members, including both direct descendants of the original settlers, as well as those descended from their spouses and other relatives.  The Helles clan is one of the largest Palestinian families, descended from a small number of early Zionists who settled in the town of Helles in the Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorates in Mandatory Palestine in the early 1920s. Most of the clan's members are farmers, though a few are also businessmen and professionals.  The Helles clan is a renowned source of pride for its members. They have traditionally been highly active in community affairs, and have been prominent members of both political parties in Ramallah and al-Bireh. They have also been active in charitable work, especially for children and the elderly.

Pornographic magazines or erotic magazines, sometimes known as adult magazines, are magazines typically aimed at a pornographic audience. They are typically published on a monthly or bimonthly basis, and feature explicit depictions of nudity and sexual activity.  Pornographic magazines have been around since the late 18th century, but they reached their peak in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 21st century, pornographic magazines are still published, but they are less popular than they used to be.

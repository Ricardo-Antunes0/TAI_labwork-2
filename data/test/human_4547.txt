Madrid, 1987 is a 2011 Spanish drama film written and directed by David Trueba.  It stars José Sacristán as an old, bitter journalist who attempts to seduce a young journalism student played by María Valverde.  It premiered at the 2011 San Sebastián International Film Festival. Plot  In 1987, Miguel, an old and bitter journalist, agrees to meet with Ángela, an idealistic young journalism student, for an interview at a local restaurant.  Ángela has missed many of her lectures and needs to write an essay; she has chosen to use Miguel as her subject.  Throughout the interview, Miguel expresses his contempt for idealism and style.  When he reads a sample of Ángela's writing, Miguel dismisses much of it, though he says that she is talented.  He asks to keep the sample and invites Ángela to his friend Luis' house.  Miguel explains that Luis will be gone until Monday, and they will have the place to themselves.  She agrees, and they continue their discussions there over whiskey.  Miguel walks over Luis' paintings, and, when Ángela objects, he says that Luis would prefer them to be marred by life and experience.  Miguel alternates between cynical advice and derisively ridiculing romantic notions of journalism.  Soon, he enters the bedroom and point blank asks Ángela to strip naked.  When she balks, he tells her that he has been true to his nature and never hidden his motives.  When she turns to leave, Miguel stops her and says that he hopes she will one day respect him for his boldness.

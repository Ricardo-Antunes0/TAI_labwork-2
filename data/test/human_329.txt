Backdrop CMS is an Open source, community-developed, content management system, written in PHP, and licensed under the GNU General Public License. Backdrop CMS was forked from the Drupal CMS in 2013 by two Drupal developers, Nate Lampton (n√©e Nate Haug) and Jen Lampton. Backdrop is very similar to version 7 of the Drupal CMS, maintaining most of the same functionality and features. The project's mission is to "enable people to build highly customized websites affordably, through collaboration and open source software". History  The Backdrop CMS project was forked about 2 years into the Drupal 8 development cycle. Backdrop therefore retained some features newly included in Drupal version 8, but excluded Symfony, and most of the many new dependencies that were added to Drupal 8. Backdrop's founders and early contributors had concerns over the significant (and at the time controversial) changes coming to Drupal, and expressed concern that maintainers of existing Drupal websites would be unable (or unwilling) to manage these changes, and the cost that comes with them.

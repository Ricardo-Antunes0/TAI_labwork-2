The province of Fermo  is a province in the Marche region of north-central Italy. The provincial capital is the city of Fermo. The province has an area of 2,262 square kilometres and a population of about 245,000.  Fermo is situated on the Via Flaminia, a major Roman road that linked Rome with the north. Fermo became an important trading centre in the Middle Ages, and prospered as a result of its favourable location. The Renaissance period saw Fermo reach its zenith as a cultural centre, and it has remained one of Italy's most important cities. In the 19th century, Fermo experienced a period of decline as its economy was adversely affected by competition from abroad. However, since the late 20th century, Fermo has undergone a resurgence as a result of its cultural heritage and its proximity to Rome.

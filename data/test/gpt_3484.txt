Sue H. Elmore was a steamboat built in 1897 in Duluth, Minnesota. The ship was named for Sue H. Elmore, the daughter of the ship's builder. The ship was the first steamboat built in Duluth and remained in operation until 1935.  Sue H. Elmore was originally built as a passenger vessel to carry passengers and cargo on the Great Lakes. The ship was also used for transportation between Duluth and Superior, Wisconsin. In 1935, Sue H. Elmore was retired from service and sold to a private owner. The ship remained in private ownership until it was sold to the Duluth Maritime Museum in 1978. The museum restored the ship and continues to operate it as a tourist attraction.

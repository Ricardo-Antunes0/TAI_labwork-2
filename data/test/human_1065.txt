Lake Menéndez (Lago Menéndez) is a large lake in Chubut Province, Argentina.  Lake Menéndez is in the chain of lakes in the Futaleufú River system of Argentina which via Yelcho Lake and the Yelcho River flows into the Pacific Ocean in Chile. Located in the Andes, Lake Menendez is Y-shaped, of glacial origin, and occupies two narrow valleys between glaciated peaks. The lake is in the Los Alerces National Park. There are no roads or other developments near the lake.  Travel is by boat or foot. Lake Menéndez is noted for the extensive Alerce (Fitzroya) forests near the tips of its two arms. Description Lake Menéndez occupies the deepest lake trough, a narrow fjord like valley, in Chubut Province. It was formed by the convergence of two glacial tongues. Near the middle of its  length the lake divides into two arms, running at right angles to each other, one continuing northwest, the other turning southwest.  The two arms are separated by Mount Torrecillas which rises to  in elevation. The Torrecillas glacier descends to within a few hundred meters of the lake's shoreline. Flowing into Lake Menéndez are several small streams originating in the snowfields and glaciers along the border with Chile,  distant.

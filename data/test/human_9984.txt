Spinterface is a term coined to indicate an interface between a ferromagnet and an organic semiconductor.  This is a widely investigated topic in molecular spintronics, since the role of interfaces plays a huge part in the functioning of a device. In particular, spinterfaces are widely studied in the scientific community because of their hybrid organic/inorganic composition. In fact, the hybridization between the metal and the organic material can be controlled by acting on the molecules, which are way more responsive to electrical and optical stimuli with respect to metals. This gives rise to the possibility of efficiently tuning the magnetic properties of the interface at the atomic scale. History  The field of spintronics, which is the scientific field that aims to study the spin-dependent electron transport in solid-state devices, emerged in the last decades of the 20th century, first with the observation of the injection of a spin-polarized current from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic metal and subsequently with the discovery of tunnel magnetoresistance and giant magnetoresistance. The field evolved turning towards spin-orbit related phenomena, such as Rashba effect. Only more recently, spintronics has been extended to the organic world, with the idea of exploiting the weak spin-relaxation mechanisms of molecules in order to use them for spin transport. Research in this field started off with hybrid replicas of inorganic spintronic devices, such as spin valves and magnetic tunneling junctions, trying to obtain spin transport in molecular films. However some devices didn't behave as expected, for example vertical spin valves displaying a negative magnetoresistance.  It was then quickly understood that the molecular layers don't just play a transport role but they can also act on the spin polarization of the ferromagnet at the interface. Because of this, the interest on ferromagnet/organic interfaces rapidly increased in the scientific community and the term "spinterface" was born. The research is currently aimed at building devices with interfaces engineered in order to tailor the spin injection.

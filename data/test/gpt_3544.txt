The Obuchi Cabinet governed Japan from July 2000 to September 2002. It was the first cabinet of the post-war era in which the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) retained control of both the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.  The Obuchi Cabinet was formed on July 20, 2000, when then-Prime Minister Yoshiro Obuchi succeeded to the post after being appointed by then-President of Japan, Kim Dae-jung. At the time, Obuchi was the second youngest Prime Minister in Japanese history, following Tetsuya Ã”buchi. The Cabinet was dissolved on September 13, 2002, following Obuchi's resignation due to poor performance in an opinion poll conducted by the Mainichi Shimbun.

Diamond Park was a baseball stadium in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was the home of the Toronto Maple Leafs professional baseball club from 1901 until 1907. It was located at the south-east corner of Liberty Street and Fraser Avenue. The stadium was also used for rugby football and lacrosse. The Maple Leafs, who had been playing at Hanlan's Point Stadium on the Toronto Islands were sold in 1900 to a group of 52 Toronto businessmen, spearheaded by Ed Mack, a tailor and former baseball player. The organization decided to construct a new stadium for the team on the mainland, which they named Diamond Park. The stadium was not ready in time for the 1901 season, forcing the team to play its first 13 games on the road. The team played its first game in the new stadium on May 10, 1901, to 5,200 fans, losing 6â€“5 to Worcester. The game was preceded by a parade from downtown to the stadium. The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by School Inspector James L. Hughes. Tickets for the games cost 25 cents for general admission, 40 cents for the grandstand and 50 cents for reserved seating.

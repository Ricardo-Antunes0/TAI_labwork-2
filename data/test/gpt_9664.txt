Christiaan Huygens, Lord of Zuilichem,  (born December 24, 1629, Zuilichem, Hollandâ€”died February 24, 1695, Paris, France), Dutch mathematician and physicist who is best known for his work on the theory of light and optics.  Christiaan Huygens was a polymath who made seminal contributions to many fields of mathematics and physics. He is particularly noted for his work on the theory of light and optics, including the development of the wave theory of light and the principle of least action. Although he made significant contributions to these fields, Huygens is perhaps best known for his work in celestial mechanics, which provided a theoretical underpinning for the accurate prediction of planetary motions.

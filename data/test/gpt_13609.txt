The Film Detective is an American classic film blog that focuses on film history, criticism, and news. The blog is written by film historian and critic Scott Mendelson, and has been published since 2006.  Mendelson began The Film Detective as a personal project in 2006, after graduating from college. Initially, the blog was an outlet for Mendelson to write about films that he enjoyed, but over time the focus shifted to include film history and criticism. In addition to writing about films, Mendelson also contributes articles to other publications, such as Sight & Sound and The A.V. Club.  The Film Detective has become one of the most popular film blogs in the world, with a readership that ranges from film students to film critics to casual moviegoers. In addition to its website, The Film Detective is also available as a podcast and a monthly print magazine.

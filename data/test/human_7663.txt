The discography of Welsh rock and roll singer Shakin' Stevens consists of twenty studio albums, 23 compilation albums, sixty-nine singles, three box sets, five video albums and thirty-seven music videos.  Although the singer enjoyed his greatest period of success throughout the 1980s while recording for Epic Records, during the 1970s he was the lead vocalist for Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets and had records issued by a variety of labels including Parlophone, CBS and Polydor in the UK and Pink Elephant and Dynamite in Europe. Shakin' Stevens had his first entry in the UK Singles Chart with "Hot Dog" in 1980 and has had a total of thirty-three UK Top 40 hits, including four number one singles, and during the 1980s spent more weeks in the UK Singles Chart than any other artist. He also achieved number one singles in Ireland, Australia, Sweden, Austria, Norway, Switzerland and Poland as well as placing three albums in the Top 3 of the UK Albums Chart.  Despite only a handful of new releases since the early 1990s, the advent of the digital download age has ensured an annual return to the UK Singles Chart for Stevens thanks to the enduring popularity of his seasonal hit "Merry Christmas Everyone".

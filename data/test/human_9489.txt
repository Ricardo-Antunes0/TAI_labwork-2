Gu Taiqing (; Pinyin: Gù Tàiqīng; 1799 – c. 1877) was one of the top-ranked women poets of the Qing Dynasty. She is especially known for her ci poetry and for her sequel to the novel Honglou meng (Dream of the Red Chamber). One scholar estimates that there are as many as 1,163 surviving poems written by Gu. Life She was descended from Manchu family from the Silin-Gioro (西林覺羅 Xilin Jueluo) clan.  There had been some debate as to whether or not she was of Manchu descent. It had been claimed that she was born into a banner family named Gu and took on Manchu identity after her marriage to Aisin-Gioro Yihui 奕会 (1799-1838), a Manchu prince. Other scholars claim that the confusion about her identity is an attempt to obscure her family's descent from E-er-tai, a Manchu grand secretary disgraced (and forced to commit suicide) during one of Qianlong's literary inquisitions.

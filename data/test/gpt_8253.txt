Phospholipases A2 (PLA2s)  are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of phospholipids, a group of lipids that are abundant in biological membranes.  PLA2s are involved in many membrane-related processes, including apoptosis, cell migration, and the synthesis of leukotrienes and prostaglandins. They are also important contributors to the development of atherosclerosis and other diseases.

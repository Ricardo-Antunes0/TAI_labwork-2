Metallic silhouette shooting is a group of photography techniques used to create silhouette images of people or objects using metallic objects as a background.  The term "metallic silhouette shooting" was first coined by the American photographer Lewis Hine in 1903. He used the technique to create images of people on street corners in New York City. The technique became popular during the 1930s and 1940s and was often used to create images for advertising.

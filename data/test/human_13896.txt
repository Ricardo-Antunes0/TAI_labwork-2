USS Kingman (APB-47) was a self-propelled barracks ship in service with the United States Navy during World War II, and briefly post-war. Laid down as LST-1113, she was then reclassified AKS-18 and named Kingman on 8 December 1944. She was then again reclassified APB-47 on 3 March 1945, and launched on 17 April 1945 by Missouri Valley Bridge & Iron Co., sponsored by Mrs. K. B. Bragg. Kingman shortly after, sailed to be fitted out in New Orleans, Louisiana, and commissioned on 27 June 1945, with Lt. R. J. Figaro in command. Ship history After her shakedown cruise in the Gulf of Mexico, Kingman cleared Gulfport, Mississippi, and steamed westward through the Panama Canal. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 2 September, the day of Japan's historic surrender. Five days later the barracks ship sailed for the Far East, arriving at Sasebo, Japan on 8 October via Eniwetok and Guam. She remained in Japanese ports for 5 months, before loading America-bound troops and departing Sasebo on 16 March 1946.

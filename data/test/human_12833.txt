The Sydney Montessori School (SMS), founded in 1981, is a Montessori, independent, coeducational, secular, day school, located in the Gymea suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The school serves preschool, primary and high school; children ages 0–16. The school was formerly known as the Sutherland Shire Montessori School. History The Sydney Montessori School, like many other Australian Montessori schools, was first established by a small group of parents. Established in Grays Point, New South Wales, in 1981, the parents were the school's first administrators, and to help fund the school, parents organised fundraisers and public events with guest speakers. The first classroom was in the home of a local parent in Grays Point under the direction of Kathy Kelly, an American Montessori teacher from Tennessee. The first primary classroom opened in 1989 under the directorship of Elizabeth Catalfamo, an American Montessori teacher. By 2012, the school had established a pre-primary program for toddlers and small children aged 3–6, a primary school for ages 6–9.  The school also operates (on site) a separate Montessori Long Day Care (15mths to 6 years). This operates from 7.00 a.m. until 6.00 pm, 48 weeks of the year. The school has seen increased enrolment numbers in recent years, with waiting lists for some year levels.

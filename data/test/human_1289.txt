Tamarisk was an Irish-bred champion Thoroughbred racehorse. After showing high class form as a two-year-old in 1997, Tamarisk was named European Champion Sprinter at the 1998 Cartier Racing Awards following a campaign which was highlighted by a win in the Group One Haydock Sprint Cup. Tamarisk was retired after an abortive attempt at the Breeders' Cup Sprint, but failed as a stallion owing to fertility problems. He returned to racing for three further seasons (2000â€“2002) but was unable to replicate his earlier success. From 2002 to 2006 he returned to stud with marginally better results. Background Tamarisk was bred in Ireland by the County Limerick based Mount Coote Stud. His sire, Green Desert, finished second to Dancing Brave in the 2000 Guineas and became a leading sprinter, winning the July Cup. Apart from Tamarisk, he sired the winners of over 1,000 races, including Oasis Dream,  Desert Prince, Sheikh Albadou and Cape Cross, the sire of Sea the Stars. Tamarisk's dam Sine Labe was unraced but came from a good family, being a half sister of the Prix Saint-Alary winner Treble and a close relative of the multiple Group One winning  racemare Triptych. Tamarisk was sent as a yearling to the Tattersalls sales in October 1996, where he was sold for 78,000gns to John Warren, a director of Highclere Thoroughbred Racing syndicate.

Leo Motzkin (also Mozkin; 1867 – 7 September 1936) was a Russian-born painter and sculptor. He is most famous for his portraits and still lifes, but he also created landscapes, figures, and other works.  Leo Motzkin was born in 1867 in the town of Taganrog in the Russian Empire to a family of modest means. He began his artistic training at the age of thirteen, studying at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg. He soon gained recognition for his talent, winning several awards and scholarships.  In 1894, Motzkin moved to Paris to continue his training at the Académie Colarossi. Here, he met and befriended fellow Russian expatriates such as Lev Kukovksy and Pavel Tchelitchew. In 1896, he exhibited his first work in Paris, a portrait of his friend Lev Kukovksy.  During the early 1900s, Motzkin worked primarily as a portrait painter. He frequently traveled to Italy to study the works of Renaissance masters such as Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. His portraits of prominent figures such as Édouard du Caurroy, Sergei Diaghilev, and Isadora Duncan are some of his most well-known work.  In 1922, Motzkin emigrated to the United States, where he continued to paint and sculpt until his death in 1936. He is buried in Mount Hebron Cemetery in Queens, New York City.

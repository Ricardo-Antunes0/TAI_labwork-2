On-the-job training (widely known as OJT) is a type of training that provides employees with the skills and knowledge they need to do their jobs effectively. OJT is usually given in the form of short, directed sessions, rather than a continuous learning process. It is most commonly used in manual or skilled trades, such as construction, welding, and automotive repair.  OJT can be a valuable tool for new employees. It can help them learn the job quickly, avoid mistakes, and get up to speed on the company's procedures. OJT can also help employees become familiar with the company culture and its policies.  Some companies give OJT as a way to recruit new employees. Others use it to retrain employees who have been let go or who have lost their skills due to experience or age. OJT can also be used to help employees who have been with the company for a long time but who may not know enough about the changes that have taken place in the industry.  OJT is often provided in a short, focused format. This allows employers to quickly teach new skills and knowledge to their employees. It also helps employees learn more quickly and avoids them from making mistakes that could lead to future problems.   There are many different types of OJT available. Some examples include: on-the-job training courses, apprenticeship programs, on-the-job coaching programs, and mentorship programs.  OJT can be used in a variety of different industries

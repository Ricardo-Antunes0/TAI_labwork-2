Elizaveta Sergeyevna Tuktamysheva ( ; ; born 17 December 1996) is a Russian figure skater. She is the 2015 World champion, the 2021 World silver medalist, the 2015 European champion, the 2014–15 Grand Prix Final champion, a 14-time medalist on the Grand Prix series, and the 2013 Russian national champion. On the junior level, she is the 2012 Youth Olympic champion, 2011 World Junior silver medalist, and 2010–11 JGP Final silver medalist. Tuktamysheva is currently the world's 3rd-highest ranked women's singles skater by the International Skating Union following the 2020–21 figure skating season. At the 2015 World Championships, she became the first female skater to land four triple jumps in a short program (triple Axel, triple Lutz, and a triple toe-triple toe combination). At the 2018–19 Grand Prix Final, she landed the maximum eight triple jumps cleanly in the free skate allowed under the Zayak rule, becoming the third woman to do so after Japanese Rika Kihira and American Mirai Nagasu. She therefore also became the first woman to land the maximum twelve triple jumps in one international competition, albeit with the triple Axel in her short program deemed under-rotated. In the final event of the 2018–19 season, the 2019 World Team Trophy, she successfully landed all twelve jumps cleanly, becoming the first woman to accomplish this feat in an official international competition.

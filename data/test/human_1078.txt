MuggleNet is the Internet's oldest and largest Harry Potter and Wizarding World fansite. Founded in 1999, MuggleNet distinguished itself early on by its unique and comprehensive content. Barely one year after it was launched, the site was seeing hundreds of thousands of daily visitors each month at its peak. It has expanded over the years to include a handful of partner podcasts, a separate book blog, over half a dozen published works, and live events. At one point, it also ran its own forums, social network, and separate fan fiction website. MuggleNet currently features over 200 pages of content plus an archive of over 18,000 articles, including news, editorials, recipes, a caption contest, and more. Originally owned by founder Emerson Spartz, MuggleNet became an independently owned and operated brand in early 2020 and according to its Twitter bio, has been women-led since 2017. Relationship with the franchise MuggleNet once benefitted from friendly relations with J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books, and the producers of the films. She has praised MuggleNet on her website and awarded it her Fan Site Award. Rowling has also recounted on her website that she visited the site and sometimes read comments left by visitors, although she never commented herself. The author also stated that she visited the site's chat room and was snubbed when she anonymously joined a conversation about Harry Potter theories.

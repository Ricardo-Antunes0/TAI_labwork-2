Cuthbert Euan Charles Rabagliati, , (1 January 1892 â€“ 6 January 1978) was a British soldier, pilot, race car driver and intelligence officer. He served in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) during the First World War and is credited as being the first RFC pilot to shoot down an enemy aircraft. As a racing driver at Brooklands in the 1930s, his crash was followed by the introduction of signs "Motor Racing is Dangerous" at all race meetings. During the Second World War he served as head of MI6's Dutch section. Early life and education Rabagliati, who preferred to use his second name Euan, was born in Manningham, Bradford, Yorkshire, the fourth son of Andrea Rabagliati and Helen Priscilla McLaren. His father, the son of an Italian political refugee who had settled in Edinburgh, worked as a surgeon at Bradford Infirmary. Euan was educated at the Loretto School in Edinburgh and Bradford Grammar School. He then attended the Royal Military College at Sandhurst as a gentlemen cadet, and after passing out was commissioned as a second lieutenant in The King's Own (Yorkshire Light Infantry) on 14 February 1912. Rabagliati became interested in flying, and was awarded Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate No. 779 after soloing a Bristol biplane at the Bristol Flying School at Brooklands on 11 May 1914. He was then transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, being appointed a flying officer on 30 June, and was promoted to lieutenant on 12 August.

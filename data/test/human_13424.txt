It has two dark green leaves and a single greenish brown or pinkish flower with a dark red to black, ant-like callus covering most of the upper surface of the labellum. It is similar to both C. seminuda and C. reflexa. Description Chiloglottis trilabra is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with two dark green, oblong to egg-shaped leaves  long and  wide. A single greenish brown or pinkish flower  long and  wide is borne on a flowering stem  high. The dorsal sepal is spatula-shaped,  long and  wide. The lateral sepals are linear,  long, less than  wide and curve downwards. There is a glandular tip  long on the dorsal sepal, dark red and  long on the lateral sepals. The petals are oblong to lance-shaped,  long, about  wide and turned downwards towards the ovary.

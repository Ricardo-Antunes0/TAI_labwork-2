In Euclidean geometry, the isodynamic points of a plane are the points at which the normal to the plane passes through the point. These points are also called the centroids of the plane.  The isodynamic points were first discovered by Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1799 while he was working on a problem concerning the intersection of planes by circular arcs. Laplace showed that if two planes intersect in a circle, then their isodynamic points are the points where their normal vectors intersect.

"Lamia" is a narrative poem written by Percy Bysshe Shelley. It was originally published in 1819 in the magazine "The Examiner".  The poem is a dark and gothic tale of a woman who is consumed by a desire for human flesh. The story follows her as she pursues and murders humans, until she is finally caught and punished.  Lamia has been interpreted as a warning about the dangers of sexual deviancy, or as an allegory for the dangers of unchecked capitalism.

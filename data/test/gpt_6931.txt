Insular script was a medieval script system used in the British Isles. It was developed in Insular Ireland and was also used in Wales, Scotland and Cornwall. The script is named after the Insular monasteries, which were among its most prolific users.  Insular script was developed between the 9th and 12th centuries AD in Insular Ireland, where it was used for the writing of Latin and Old Irish. It was also used for the writing of Welsh, Scots and Cornish, although to a lesser extent. After the Norman invasion of England in 1066, the use of Insular script in England declined, although it continued to be used in Ireland until the 15th century. In Scotland, Insular script was displaced by Gaelic script around the same time. In Cornwall, however, Insular script survived until the 18th century, later being superseded by English printing.  Insular script is characterised by its rounded forms and its lack of joinery between letters. It is usually written left-to-right, although there are some examples of inscriptions written right-to-left. There is no lowercase lettering or numerals in Insular script, although some numerals are represented by combinations of letters. The letters are generally tall and thin with a slightly concave top, except for w which is slightly convex.

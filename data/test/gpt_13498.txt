The piccolo  (; Italian for "small") is a small member of the woodwind family of instruments. It is a transverse flute with a single reed, that is often played in ensembles.  The piccolo has a relatively short body, wide bore, and relatively large finger holes. The flute is played in the same way as the other members of the woodwind family, by using the fingers to produce sound. The piccolo is most commonly used in classical and jazz music, but it can also be found in various other genres of music.

SoloTürk or Solo Türk, often stylized as SOLOTÜRK, is a single-aircraft aerobatic demonstration team of the Turkish Air Force. Plans for the team began in November 2009 and the pilot training process was finalized in August 2010 with three pilots initially. The first demonstration flight was performed within the military in September 2010, and the team made its first public appearance 15 April 2011. Since then, SoloTürk has  participated in several national and international airshows, with most maneuvers in demonstration flights being special to the team. The team uses a specially-painted General Dynamics F-16C Block 40 aircraft which is combat ready. SoloTürk formerly operated out of the Akıncı Air Base, but moved to the Konya Air Base in 2016 after the coup d'état attempt. The team has a total of 13 personnel, including two pilots, and uses a CASA CN-235M-100 for transportation. Pilots wanting to fly for the team must meet certain criteria before they qualify for a training. SoloTürk has received multiple awards for its demonstration flights.

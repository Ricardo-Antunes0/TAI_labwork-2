She was also a prominent member of the International Brigade during the Spanish Civil War.  Bernstein was born in Berlin, then part of the German Empire, to Jewish parents. In 1933, she fled Nazi Germany for England with her brother, Arnold. She became a naturalised British citizen in 1940.  Bernstein's political career began in 1945, when she joined the Labour Party and was appointed its general secretary. During her tenure, Labour won four general elections and established a welfare state. Bernstein resigned from her position in 1961, but continued to be involved in politics until her death eight years later.

The Liaoshen campaign  Liáoshěn huìzhàn, an anti-Japanese campaign waged by the Chinese Red Army during World War II, was a series of military engagements fought in China's north-west.  The campaign began in November 1939, when Japanese forces invaded Manchuria. The Chinese Red Army, commanded by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and aided by Soviet forces, quickly repelled the attack. Over the following months, the Chinese forces advanced southwards into Inner Mongolia and then northwards into Hebei and Henan provinces, eventually trapping large numbers of Japanese troops in a series of pockets. In May 1945, the Japanese surrendered following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  The Liaoshen campaign is generally regarded as one of the greatest victories of the Chinese Red Army, and is often cited as an example of guerrilla warfare at its best.

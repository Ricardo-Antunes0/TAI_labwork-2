Kosher Love is a 2017 Canadian documentary film of love as understood by Orthodox and Hasidic Jews. The documentary was directed by filmmaker Evan Beloff and aired on the CBC-TV television channel. The film was also entered into Jewish Film Festivals in Canada, the United States, and in Poland. Background Kosher Love was commissioned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and notedly focuses on the advice and guidance offered by Rabbi Yisroel Bernath of the Chabad Hasidic community. Bernath serves as the spiritual director of a Chabad House in Notre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce and as the chaplain at Concordia University (Loyola Campus). Prior to the making of Kosher Love, Bernath received public attention for his matchmaking service known as "JMontreal" which represent an attempt to offer formal matchmaking services in addition to more common pastoral care offered by rabbis. While Bernath is portrayed in the film as a friendly and affable, he is viewed somewhat critically in the Jewish community press for a perceived dismissiveness of all non-Orthodox religious denominations.

Anglo-Saxon paganism, sometimes termed Anglo-Saxon heathenism (, ), is the term used to describe the religious beliefs and practices of the Anglo-Saxons during the period from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD. The term is used primarily by historians, although some contemporary Pagans also use it.  The Anglo-Saxons were a people who inhabited parts of Great Britain and Ireland in the Early Middle Ages. They were descendants of the Germanic peoples who had migrated to Great Britain and Ireland in the 5th and 6th centuries AD, and they spoke a language that was part of the West Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family.  The religious beliefs of the Anglo-Saxons were characterised by a strong sense of pantheism, belief in a single god who was all-powerful and all-knowing, and a strong emphasis on natural phenomena and on magic. They also believed in an afterlife, which they believed in as a place of judgement after death. The Anglo-Saxon pagan religion was centred on pagan temples, which were often built near springs or rivers.  The Anglo-Saxon pagan religion declined in influence after the introduction of Christianity in the 7th century AD, but it continued to be practiced by some people until the 11th century.

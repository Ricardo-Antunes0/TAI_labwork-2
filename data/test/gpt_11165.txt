Colonel Marie Augstin Gaston Cros (known as Gaston Cros) (March 7, 1836 – October 16, 1905) was a French military officer and explorer.  Cros was born in Lille, France on March 7, 1836. He was the son of a wealthy lawyer, and he attended the military academy at Brienne-le-Château. Cros then served in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 and in the colonial campaigns of Algeria and Tunisia.  Cros became an officer in the French Army in 1868. He served in various postings in Africa before being appointed to lead a military expedition to central Africa in 1881. The expedition was unsuccessful, and Cros was briefly imprisoned by the British before being released.  In 1885, Cros led an expedition to discover Lake Tanganyika. The expedition succeeded in crossing the lake and discovered much new information about its geography and flora. Cros also made several important archaeological discoveries during the expedition, including a number of ancient stone carvings.  Cros died in 1905 at the age of seventy-seven. He is buried in Bagneux cemetery in Paris, France.

Khmer sastra is a sastra, or manuscript, of traditional Khmer writing. It is composed of a corpus of texts on grammar, rhetoric, poetics, and philosophy. The corpus includes works from the late medieval period to the present day.  Khmer sastra has been an important source of literary inspiration for contemporary writers in Cambodia and throughout Southeast Asia. It has also been used as a tool for disseminating knowledge and promoting cultural values among Khmer speakers.

Canaan Land is a 2020 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Richard Rossi and starring Richard Rossi as Brother Billy and Rebecca Holden as Sister Sara Sunday.  It is based on the novel of the same name by Rossi. Like the novel it was based on, the film generated controversy at the time of its release from evangelical religious groups, who took issue with Rossi exposing fraudulent faith-healing techniques of well-known televangelists. Background After playing the lead role in a 1998 Los Angeles play version of the novel Elmer Gantry, Rossi was cast in the lead role of the con man preacher Elmer Gantry in a film remake of the 1960 Academy Award-winning film of the same name, slated to be directed by Amin Q. Chaudhri.Chaudhri sought investors for a $20 million budget.  The remake was never made, but Rossi began writing his own story of an Elmer Gantryish evangelist in a contemporary setting.   In March, 2016, it was reported that Rossi was in pre-production on his film Canaan Land. Rebecca Holden was cast to play Sister Sara Sunday.

Viewers Choice was a Canadian English language sketch comedy show which aired on CBC Television from 1989 to 1998.  The show was a spin-off of the successful series The Kids in the Hall, and featured a cast of young comedians who performed sketches and skits for a live audience. Viewers Choice was notable for its recurring characters and its willingness to experiment with style and format, often mixing sketch comedy with stand-up comedy, music videos, and even dramatic monologues.  The show was cancelled after six seasons due to low ratings. However, Viewers Choice has since been revered by many comedy fans as one of the best shows CBC ever produced.

The Teikoku Databank and Tokyo Shoko Research acknowledge Kongō Gumi as the Japanese company with the longest history. History Headquartered in Osaka, Kongō Gumi was a family-owned construction company. It traced its origins to 578 CE, when Prince Shōtoku invited three craftsmen from Baekje (one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea) to Japan to build the Buddhist temple Shitennō-ji. The commission of Shitennō-ji was part of a massive national project led by Prince Shōtoku, who was devoted to Buddhism, an unpopular religion at the time; thus, the carpenters brought knowledge to build Buddhist temples and lead the construction. A family member of Kongō Gumi decided to start his own business, which became Kongō Gumi in 578 CE. Over the centuries, Kongō Gumi participated in the construction of many famous buildings, including the 16th century Osaka Castle.

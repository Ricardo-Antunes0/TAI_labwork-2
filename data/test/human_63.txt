Gwen Robinson Awsumb (25 September 1915  – 16 January 2003) was an American politician and social activist. In 1967, she became the first woman to be elected to the city council in Memphis, Tennessee, United States. Her legacy is of challenging “political, social, and racial obstacles with her status as a white, female Republican” in the South. During the Memphis sanitation strike in 1968 she became a prominent local figure. Early life and education Gwendolyn Van Court Robinson was born on September 25, 1915, in Marshall, Michigan to parents Catherine VanCourt (Pritchartt) Robinson and Carl Arnold Robinson. Her father was a lawyer and served as a Democrat in the Michigan state legislature for 15 years. The family moved to Chicago and then to North Florida during the depths of the Great Depression, before settling in Memphis in 1930 when she was at the age of 15. She graduated from St. Mary's Episcopal School in 1932, but was initially unable to attend college due to the family's financial difficulties. She eventually studied chemistry at Southwestern College (later renamed Rhodes College) and obtained a degree in 1937.

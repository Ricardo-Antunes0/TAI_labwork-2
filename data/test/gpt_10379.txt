Iranâ€“Turkey relations refer to the bilateral relations between Iran and Turkey. The two countries have a long history of bilateral ties, going back to the time of the Ottoman Empire. However, relations between the two countries deteriorated after the Iranian Revolution in 1979. The two countries have since repaired their relations, but they continue to have some political and economic disagreements.  The two countries have had a number of bilateral meetings to try to resolve these disagreements. However, there has been little progress made. The main issues that have caused tension between the two countries are the Iranian nuclear program and Turkish membership in the European Union.

The first Nairi  computer was developed and launched into production in 1964, at the Yerevan Research Institute of Mathematical Machines (Yerevan, Armenia), and were chiefly designed by Rachya E. Hovsepyan. In 1965, a modified version called Nairi-M, and in 1967 versions called Nairi-S and Nairi-2, were developed. Nairi-3 and Nairi-3-1, which used integrated hybrid chips, were developed in 1970. These computers were used for a wide class of tasks in a variety of areas, including Mechanical Engineering and the Economics. Nairi-3  Of all the models of the Nairi computer systems, the micro-program control principles of the Nairi-1 were improved and expanded on the most in the Nairi-3 models. Through the advances in computer technology since the initial production year of 1964, it became possible for upwards of 128 thousand micro-instructions to be stored at one time. Not to mention the reduction in access times due to advances in the manufacture process of the components. This enabled for a Multilingual Computing structure, and time-sharing modes with simultaneous access of up to 64 terminals; which could all perform the functions of one computer.

The Fraticelli (Italian for "Little Brethren") or the Brothers of the Common Life were a reform movement within the Catholic Church during the 15th century.  They were a loosely organised group of priests and brothers who espoused poverty, chastity, and obedience to a single leader. Their motto was "Obedience is better than sacrifice", which emphasised their rejection of the elaborate ceremonies and privileges associated with the priesthood.  The Fraticelli were persecuted by the ecclesiastical authorities and eventually disbanded in 1499. However, their ideals have had a lasting impact on the Church and remain influential to this day.

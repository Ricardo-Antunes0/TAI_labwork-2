The Triple Crown is a "championship" consisting of three 500 Mile Super Speedway races on the IndyCar calendar. Traditionally, the crown jewel races were events at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Pocono Raceway, and a third race at either Ontario Motor Speedway, Michigan International Speedway, or Auto Club Speedway. In some years a driver would be recognized as a "Triple Crown Champion" if he/she scored the most points in the three races; Al Unser being the only driver to win all three 500 mile races during the 1978 IndyCar Season. Even though three super speedways and three 500 mile races have been featured in many seasons, only in 1971–1989 and 2013–2015 were "Triple Crowns" recognized. History The Triple Crown concept was first suggested by Pocono Raceway General Manager Bill Marvel in 1970. Hoping to replicate the success of horse racing's Triple Crown, Pocono promoted their debut race in 1971 as joining an elite group of three 500 miles IndyCar races. Other "Crown Jewel" races included the Indianapolis 500 and the California 500 at Ontario Motor Speedway which debuted in 1970. The driver that scored the most points in the three 500 mile races would be presented with a diamond-studded gold ring. Joe Leonard won the first two Triple Crown championships in 1971 and 1972.

Fenal책r is a traditional  Norwegian cured meat made from salted and dried leg of lamb.  Fenal책r  is a very popular dish in Norway  and is often served with other preserved food at a Christmas buffet or at Norwegian Constitution Day.  Curing time is normally about three months, but  fenal책r may be matured for a year or more. In some parts of the region, especially in the Voss area, the leg is also slightly smoked (using a cold smoke process) before curing to prevent any mould-related problems that may occur when drying meat in a humid, mild climate.  It is still quite common for many Norwegians to salt and cure the meat at home.  The finished meat is dark red to brown in color. Fresh cut slices of high quality fenal책r are smooth, tender and somewhat shiny, but not moist. The taste is slightly sweetish and not too salty. The meat must have a pronounced, but never rancid, taste of mutton.

Pterostylis dolichochila, commonly known as the long-tongued fern, is a species of fern in the family Pterostylidaceae. It is native to eastern and southeastern Australia, where it grows in moist, shady places on the ground. The fronds are long and slender, with a somewhat drooping tip. The sporangia are borne on short stalks near the base of the frond, and the spores are released by rain or dew.

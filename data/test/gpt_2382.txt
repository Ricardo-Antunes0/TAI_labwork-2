M. V. Ramana is Professor and Simons Chair in Vedanta at the University of California, Irvine. He is known for his work in the philosophy of Vedanta and for his contributions to the philosophy of mind.  Ramana was born in 1925 in Sringeri, a village in the state of Karnataka, India. As a child he exhibited signs of great spiritual potential and was encouraged by his parents to pursue a spiritual life. In 1944 Ramana met an Advaita teacher named Nisargadatta Maharaj, who greatly influenced Ramana's spiritual development.   Ramana became interested in Advaita Vedanta and began intensive study of the philosophy under Nisargadatta Maharaj. In 1950, at the age of 26, Ramana attained moksha (liberation) and became an Advaita teacher himself. He spent the remainder of his life traveling and teaching disciples throughout India and abroad. Ramana died in 1997 at the age of 85.

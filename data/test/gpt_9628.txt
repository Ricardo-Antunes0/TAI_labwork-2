The Mugwumps were Republican political activists in the United States who, from the early 1970s until the late 1980s, supported candidates outside of the Republican Party.  The term "Mugwumps" was first coined in 1972 by journalist and political commentator Drew Pearson. The Mugwumps were a group of Republicans who did not support Richard Nixon in the 1972 presidential election, despite his being the party's nominee. Many of these Republicans later voted for George McGovern in the United States presidential election, 1972.  The term has since been used to describe individuals and groups who support liberal or independent candidates in United States national elections.

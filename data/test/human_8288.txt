The National Employment Standards (NES) is a list of ten minimum entitlements for employees in Australia who are covered by the Fair Work Act 2009. An award, enterprise agreement, other registered agreement or employment contract cannot provide for conditions that are less than the national minimum wage or the NES and they can not be excluded. The NES have applied to employees since 1 January 2010, having replaced the previous five entitlement standard (called the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard) under the WorkChoices legislation. History Under the WorkChoices amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996, employees were entitled to a system of entitlements in five key areas, called the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard (or APFCS):  wages (basic rates of pay and casual loadings)  maximum ordinary hours of work (38 per week plus reasonable additional hours)  annual leave  personal leave (comprising personal/carer's leave, unpaid carer's leave and unpaid compassionate leave)  parental leave.

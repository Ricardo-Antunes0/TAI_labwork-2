The Augusta Resolves was a statement adopted by the Virginia General Assembly on February 22, 1774, that declared the American Revolution to be a civil war. The resolves called for all men in British colonies to arm themselves and form militias to oppose British forces.  The statement was adopted after the House of Burgesses passed a resolution on February 14 declaring that "all men are created equal" and "they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights." The House of Burgesses also called for all colonists to unite against their common enemy.  The Augusta Resolves called for all able-bodied colonists to arm themselves and form militias to defend themselves against the British. The resolution also urged Virginians to boycott British goods and seek independence from the British colonies.

Isol the Pisan, also known as Ciolo da Pisa, was an Italian painter of the early Renaissance.  Born in Pisa in the mid-14th century, Isol worked in the city's painting guild for most of his career. He is best known for his religious paintings, which typically feature saintly figures surrounded by a halo of light. His work has been praised for its clarity and precision, characteristics that are said to have been influenced by the work of Masaccio.  Isol died in Pisa in 1443, at the age of around 75. His work remains popular today, and he is often compared to contemporaries such as Masaccio and Fra Angelico.

The Nasmyth telescope, also called Nasmythâ€“Cassegrain or simply Nasmyth, is an optical telescope first constructed by James Nasmyth in 1846. It is named after its Scottish inventor and engineer, John Cassegrain.  The Nasmyth telescope is a reflective telescope design that uses a spherical primary mirror to collect light and then directs it to a focal plane where it is focused onto a second, flat mirror. The telescope's focal length is determined by the distance between the two mirrors. The Nasmyth design was revolutionary for its time, as it employed a simple and inexpensive construction method that allowed for mass production.  Today, the Nasmyth telescope is still one of the most popular types of telescopes available. It is used for research purposes, as well as for amateur astronomy.

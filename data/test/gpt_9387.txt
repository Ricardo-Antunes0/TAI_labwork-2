The Provisional Constitutional Order Judges case (shortened to PCO case) was a legal case in Ireland that concerned the suspension of the Irish Constitution by the Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) on 14 May 1922. The case was heard by the Supreme Court of Ireland and resulted in the reinstatement of the Constitution on 17 May 1922.  The provisional government, led by Eamon de Valera, had suspended the Constitution on 14 May 1922 in order to allow for an election to be held that would give more representation to the Catholic minority. The opposition, who were supported by Britain, argued that this was an unconstitutional action and that the Constitution should be reinstated immediately. The case was heard by the Supreme Court of Ireland, which ruled in favour of the opposition and reinstated the Constitution on 17 May 1922. This event is often seen as marking the end of the Irish War of Independence.

Rockford Rage is a women's flat track roller derby league based in Rockford, Illinois. Founded in 2006, the league consists of a single team which competes against teams from other leagues. Rockford is a member of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA). History The league was founded in mid-2006 by Rebecca Engebretson and others, with its first practices held in the parking lot of a Borders bookstore. Its first bout was played in December, 2006, an interleague contest between the Demolition Dolls and the Screw City Slammers, part of a four team inter-league squad that also included the Midwest Maulers and the Rollitas. The bout attracted 650 fans. In 2009, the league attracted attention for its abandonment of smoking breaks. This was the same year that the Rockford Rage converted into a traveling team format, forming an All Star team and a B team called the Rockford Rag Dolls.  The B team and the inter-league teams have since been disbanded, leaving the current All Star roster.

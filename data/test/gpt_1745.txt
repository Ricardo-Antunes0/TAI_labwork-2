The Douglas Mark III is a British flying boat that was operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy from the late 1930s until the early 1950s.  The Douglas Mark III was a major advance over its predecessor, the Douglas Mark II, which had been in service with the RAF since 1935. The Mark III was faster, more manoeuvrable, and had a greater range, making it better suited for long-range patrols and maritime reconnaissance. However, the Mark III was also more expensive to operate and maintain, and was less well-armed than competing aircraft such as the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and North American P-51 Mustang.  The RAF operated 156 Mark III aircraft between 1937 and 1951, while the Royal Navy had 85 examples. The majority of these were lost in combat or accidents, although a handful were used in reconnaissance missions over Occupied Europe during World War II. The last known active RAF Mark III was retired in 1957.

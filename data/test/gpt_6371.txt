Christmemel (Latin: Christi Memela, Kyrsmemel, Kirsmomela) was a medieval city in what is now Latvia.  Christmemel was first mentioned in the 12th century as the seat of a bishopric. It was the birthplace of Saint Aldona, an important female missionary in the 13th century. In 1242, Christmemel was destroyed by the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, and never recovered its former glory. Today only a few ruins remain.

Integral imaging is an autostereoscopic and multiscopic imaging technique that uses a single image sensor to capture an image from multiple perspectives. It was first developed in the early 2000s and has been used in a number of applications, such as optical character recognition and 3D printing.   Integral imaging has several advantages over traditional autostereoscopic methods. First, it can capture images from multiple perspectives without the need for additional hardware, making it more versatile and less expensive. Second, it can generate high-quality images that are indistinguishable from those produced by traditional methods. Finally, integral imaging can be used to generate 3D images without the need for special glasses or devices.

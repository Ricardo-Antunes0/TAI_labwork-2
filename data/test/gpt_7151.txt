Ron Wigginton (born October 1, 1944, in Toledo, Ohio) is an American jazz pianist and composer.  Wigginton began studying piano at the age of six, and by the time he was thirteen had started playing in local ensembles. He attended the University of Toledo and then transferred to the University of Cincinnati, where he studied with Lennie Tristano. In 1969 he moved to New York City and began working with such jazz luminaries as Archie Shepp, Art Farmer, and Ray Brown. He also formed a quartet with saxophonist Joe Henderson and bassist Ron Carter, which recorded several albums for the Blue Note label. In 1984 Wigginton moved to Paris, where he has lived since then.  Wigginton's solo recordings consist almost entirely of original compositions. He has also collaborated with a wide variety of musicians, including Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Eddie Harris, Joe Henderson, Ron Carter, John Scofield, and Gary Burton. In 2000 he was awarded the French National Prize for Arts.

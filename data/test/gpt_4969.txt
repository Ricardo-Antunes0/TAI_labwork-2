On 30 December 1997, gunmen belonging to the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) massacred 28 members of the Nislamari family in the town of Tindouf, Algeria. The massacre is considered one of the most notorious acts of terrorism in Algeria's history.  The Nislamari family was a well-known and respected family in Tindouf, and their murder sparked public outrage and led to a wave of protests and violence against the FIS. The massacre is widely seen as a pivotal event that contributed to the FIS's defeat in the Algerian Civil War.

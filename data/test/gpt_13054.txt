Trenck's Pandurs (, , Hungarian: Pandúr) were a mercenary group of light cavalry in the service of the Ottoman Empire during the 16th century.  The pandurs were first mentioned in 1504, when they were employed by the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus in his war against the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. The group most likely originated from Transylvania, but by 1514 they had been stationed in Constantinople. They were feared and respected by their opponents, and were particularly effective mounted archers. Over the course of their career, the pandurs fought in campaigns throughout Europe, Asia Minor and North Africa. They are most famous for their role in the Battle of Mohács in 1526, where they aided Selim I in his victory over Ferdinand I of Austria and Maximilian I Holy Roman Emperor. The pandurs were disbanded following Selim's death in 1540, but continued to serve various Ottoman sultans until the end of the empire in 1774.

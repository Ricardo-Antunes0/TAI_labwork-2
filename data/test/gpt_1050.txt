A strip club is a venue where live entertainment is provided by a stage where strippers perform. The term is usually applied to places where nudity is mandatory, though not always.  Strip clubs are often associated with the adult entertainment industry, but they are also found in other venues, such as concert halls and casinos. There are also strip clubs located in military bases and universities.  The popularity of strip clubs has waxed and waned with the changing times. In the early days of cinema, strip clubs were a popular form of entertainment for moviegoers. However, as time passed and more people moved away from going to theaters, the number of strip clubs decreased. However, in recent years, the number of strip clubs has been on the rise again. This may have been due to the increasing popularity of online pornography and other forms of adult entertainment.

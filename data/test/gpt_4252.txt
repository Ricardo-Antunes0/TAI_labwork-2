The Cryptodira  are a suborder of the turtle family. They are distinguished from other turtles by their large heads and short necks. Some of the Cryptodira are endemic to Madagascar, while others are found throughout the African continent. The Cryptodira are a poorly understood group of turtles, with a limited fossil record. They are thought to have evolved in Africa about 100 million years ago, and were dominant during the Middle Eocene.

Cryogenic particle detectors operate at very low temperatures, typically in the range of -269.15 degrees Celsius (-553.59 degrees Fahrenheit). This extreme cold allows the detector to detect particles that would otherwise be too small or too fast for conventional detectors. Cryogenic particle detectors are used to study the physics of particles that exist in the very low temperatures of the universe.

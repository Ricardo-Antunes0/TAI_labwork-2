Blessed Gerard (c. 1040 â€“ 3 September 1111) was a French Roman Catholic priest and mystic. He is best known for his many mystical revelations, which he claimed were given to him by the Blessed Virgin Mary.  Gerard was born in the south of France, probably in the town of Auch, around 1040. He entered the priesthood in 1065 and began his career as a parish priest in southern France. In 1084, Gerard made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and during his stay there he had a series of mystical experiences that he claimed were given to him by the Blessed Virgin Mary. These revelations led him to develop a powerful faith in the Catholic Church and he became one of the most influential religious figures of his time.  In 1095, Gerard made another pilgrimage to Jerusalem and this time he spent much of his time touring the Holy Land. On his return journey, he stopped in Constantinople and there he had a series of further mystical experiences that led him to develop a belief in Eastern Orthodoxy. In 1111, Gerard died in Lyon, France, at the age of 63.

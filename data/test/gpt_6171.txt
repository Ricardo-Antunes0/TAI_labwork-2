Saint Defendens of Thebes  is venerated as a patron saint of the military. He is also considered to be a protector of travellers.  Saint Defendens was born in Thebes, in or around the year 360. He was the son of a rich citizen named Secundus and his wife Julia.   At an early age, Defendens showed a great interest in the military and began training under the guidance of a master swordsman. Eventually, he joined the army and rose through the ranks, eventually becoming a captain.   In 451 AD, during the reign of Emperor Leo I, Saint Defendens was fighting on the side of the emperor against forces loyal to the usurper Zeno. In one particularly fierce battle, Saint Defendens killed several of his opponents with his sword before finally being overcome by sheer numbers.   He was captured and brought before Zeno, who asked him whether he wanted to live or die. Saint Defendens replied that he wanted to die in battle rather than be captured alive. Zeno spared him and instead had him tortured for information about his allies.   Eventually, Saint Defendens gave in and provided information about his allies' whereabouts. This led to their capture and execution, which supposedly saved Saint Defendens' life.   After this ordeal, Saint Defendens returned to his army and continued to serve the emperor faithfully. He eventually became a lieutenant general and died in 568 AD at the age of 80.

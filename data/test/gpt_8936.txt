位 Pavonis, Latinized as Lambda Pavonis, is a star in the constellation Pavo. With an apparent visual magnitude of 4.7, it is the sixth-brightest star in the night sky. It is a white dwarf, the corpse of a star that has exhausted its fuel supply and collapsed into a compact object.  位 Pavonis was discovered by the German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel on November 14, 1825, while he was observing the night sky from his observatory in Halle. At the time, it was considered to be a new star and its Bayer designation was 3 Lambda Pavonis. It was later determined to be a white dwarf, which was named after the Greek letter 位 (lambda), which is the symbol for the letter P. 位 Pavonis is about 2.5 times as massive as the Sun and has about half of the Sun's total surface area.

This album was recorded on one of those shows and features performances by the band as well as guest appearances by Jerry Garcia, Ron "Pigpen" McKernan, and Phil Lesh.  The album has been described as "quirky" and "weird", with an "oddball" sound. It is mostly acoustic, with some electric guitars and drums. The songs are mostly short, with most lasting less than three minutes.  Lorca is not particularly well-known among Grateful Dead fans, but it is occasionally played live by the band or by other improvisational jam bands.

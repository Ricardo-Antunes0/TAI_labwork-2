The term West Lusatia  was coined by the Prussian historian Heinrich von Treitschke in the late 19th century in order to designate the area that now makes up the state of Lower Saxony in northwestern Germany.  West Lusatia is a region in northwestern Germany. It covers an area of 9,867 square kilometres, making it the second largest region in the state after North Lusatia. The region is bordered by Saxony to the east, Brandenburg to the northeast, Thuringia to the south and west, and Saxony-Anhalt to the north.  West Lusatia comprises three districts: Bautzen, GÃ¶rlitz and Halle (all three of which are part of Saxony). The regional capital is Halle. The West German federal election, 1990 was held in West Lusatia.

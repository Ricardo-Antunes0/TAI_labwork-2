Elizabeth Lilburne (fl. 1641â€“1660), born Elizabeth Dewell, was an English feminist and political activist. She was one of the first women to openly criticize male supremacy and to call for equal rights for women.   Lilburne is chiefly remembered for her role in the 1648 uprising known as the Revolt of the Women, during which she participated in a series of organized protests and rebellions against the English government. After the uprising was put down, Lilburne was arrested and spent several years in prison before being released in 1653. She subsequently moved to France, where she continued to advocate for women's rights. Lilburne died in poverty in 1660.  Elizabeth Lilburne was born on December 5, 1641, in London to a wealthy family. In 1648, at the age of 24, she participated in the Revolt of the Women, an uprising against male supremacy that is considered one of the earliest examples of feminist activism. The revolt began with a series of peaceful protests organized by Lilburne and other female activists, but it quickly turned into a series of rebellions. In particular, Lilburne participated in a failed attempt to take control of London's Tower of London and in a successful attempt to overthrow the English government. After the uprising was put down, Lilburne was arrested and spent several years in prison before being released in 1653. She subsequently moved to France, where she continued to advocate for women's rights. Lilburne died in poverty on February 9, 1660.

The white-tailed swallow (Hirundo megaensis) is a passerine bird in the family Hirundinidae. It is a resident breeder in North America and Eurasia. The nominate subspecies is found in eastern North America and winters further south in Central America, as well as in southern Mexico. The other subspecies, the white-tailed swallow - Oriental (H. m. ophiraea), breeds in much of western Eurasia and winters mainly in the Middle East and southwestern Asia. These subspecies are sometimes considered conspecific, but they can be distinguished by their plumage coloration and size measurements.  The white-tailed swallow is a medium-sized passerine bird with a length of 31 to 41 cm and a weight of 2.3 to 2.9 kg. It has a long tail, a large head and neck, a short thick bill, and long legs. It is mainly brown with some white on the wings, tail, and underparts. The sexes are similar but the female is slightly smaller than the male. The juvenile has more brown than white on its upperparts and does not have a tail band.  The white-tailed swallow is a common bird throughout its range except for a small area in the far north of Canada. It nests in colonies on cliffs or tall buildings, laying two to four eggs which are incubated by the female alone for 18 to 21 days. After hatching, the young birds fledge within a week. They feed on insects picked from the air or caught on

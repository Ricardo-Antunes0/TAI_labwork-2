She was detained at Şakran prison, İzmir Province. Her arbitrary detention and judicial harassment were part of the FETÖ/PDY (Fethullahist Terror Organisation/ Parallel State Structure) Investigation launched in 2015 by İzmir Chief Public Prosecutor's Office and Organised Crime Bureau Prosecutor's Office into Gediz University, targeting several academics, following July's failed coup. The investigation was based on allegations that these academics are either members, or connected to terrorist organisations. Several human rights' organizations had asked for action to be taken. She was freed after 94 days of arrest, in late March, 2017.

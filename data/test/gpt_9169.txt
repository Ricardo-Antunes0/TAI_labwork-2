Blyth Power Station (also known as Cambois Power Station) is a coal-fired power station located in Blyth, Northumberland, England. The plant has two 210 megawatt (MW) generating units, built in 1969 and 1974. It is owned and operated by Energy UK.  The station was originally commissioned in 1969 as part of the Central Electricity Generating Board's (CEGB's) plan to increase electricity supplies in England. At the time, the plant was the largest coal-fired power station in Europe. In 1974, it was upgraded to 210 MW with the addition of a second unit.  In 1998, both units were decommissioned due to concerns about their safety. In 2002, plans were announced to refurbish and reactivate the plant, with a target date of 2006. However, this plan was later put on hold due to financial difficulties.  In 2013, Energy UK announced that it had agreed to sell the plant to SSE for Â£95 million. Construction commenced in 2014 and was completed in 2016. The plant re-opened on 16 October 2016 and provides around 1% of the UK's electricity needs.

An electoral system or voting system is a method of selecting representatives to a public body, such as a parliament or a committee.   Electoral systems can be classified by the way the votes are cast, by who can vote, or by the type of public body they produce. The three main types of electoral systems are first-past-the-post, proportional representation and mixed member proportional representation.   There are many different electoral systems, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. One of the most important factors to consider when choosing an electoral system is the size of the population, since different systems are better suited for different countries.

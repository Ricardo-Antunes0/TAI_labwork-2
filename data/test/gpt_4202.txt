German submarine U-606 was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II.  Built at the Blohm & Voss yards in Hamburg, U-606 was launched on 26 October 1941 and commissioned on 1 January 1942 under the command of Erich Topp. After training with the 4th U-boat Flotilla, she took part in Operation Cerberus, the final German offensive against Allied shipping in the Mediterranean Sea, from May to October 1943.  In November 1943, U-606 was transferred to the 12th U-boat Flotilla for operations in the North Atlantic. She sank two tankers before being sunk by depth charges off Cape Race on 3 February 1944. Of the 53 crew members on board, only four survived.

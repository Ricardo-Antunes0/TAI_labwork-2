The Old Stone Chimney, is located in the city of Niagara Falls, New York.  It is a masonry chimney built as part of a two-story barracks on the site of the French "Fort du Portage," or "Fort Little Niagara," by Daniel Joncaire in 1750, when the Niagara River and its shores were part of New France on the North American continent. The chimney has been repurposed several times since by British and American interests. Relocated three times (1902, 1942, and 2015), the Old Stone Chimney is currently located between the Niagara River and the Robert Moses Parkway east of the Adams Slip along the bike path on the river. Previously located in the former Porter Park on Buffalo Avenue, at the foot of 10th Street along an embankment of the Robert Moses Parkway, close to the exit ramp to John B. Daly Boulevard. The Old Stone Chimney is 31 feet tall and weighs approximately 60 tons.

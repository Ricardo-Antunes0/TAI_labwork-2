Balinț  is a commune in Timiș County, Romania. It is composed of four villages: Balinț, Bodo , Fădimac  and Târgoviște . It borders Bara to the north, Coșteiu to the south, Belinț and Ghizela to the west and Bethausen to the east. History  Since the 10th–11th centuries, there have been numerous floods on the middle course of the Bega River. Balinț, being located 500 meters from the Bega riverbed, was periodically flooded. In the 11th century, some of the villagers moved to a hearth protected from floods. A new village appears, derived from the first, Balințul de Sus (Upper Balinț), located in the Church valley, and Balințul de Jos (Lower Balinț) remains on the old hearth. The first recorded mention of Balinț dates from 1488, when Count Ferenc Haraszti donates the Felső-Bályncz estate to his daughter. By 1554 the two settlements merged under the name Balinch. In 1604, around Balinț, there are battles between the troops of George I Rákóczi and the rebels of Stephen Bocskai (future Prince of Transylvania) and Gabriel Bethlen. Balinț is mentioned in the documents from 1690 and 1717, meaning that it continued to exist during the Turkish occupation. At the 1717 census it had 20 houses. In 1739 Austrian troops retaliated against the villagers who supported the Turks during the Austro-Turkish War of 1737–1739 and took part in the uprising. The villages of Balinț, Fădimac and Târgoviște were burned down by the imperial armies. By 1740 the Austrians set new hearths for the burned villages.

The Girard Public Library, a Carnegie library, was established in 1899 in Girard, Kansas, United States. The original building was constructed in 1906, at 128 West Prairie Avenue.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. It was the first free library in the city. History At Thanksgiving 1897, Jane Addams, founder of Hull House in Chicago, was a guest of her sister, S. Alice Haldeman, in Girard, an active worker in the Presbyterian Church. Miss Addams gave a talk at the church on "Social Settlements," and was surprised to learn at this time that Girard was without a public library, although Cherokee and Weir City had already taken such a step. In January 1898, Mrs. McKay, president of the Ladies Reading Club, appointed Mrs. Haldeman, Mrs. Griffin, Mrs. Smith, and Mrs. Wasser a committee to study the situation. A year later, January 21, 1899, representatives of the Ladies Reading Club, the Mutual Improvement Club, and the Sunflower Club met with Mrs. Haldeman and formed the Federation of City Clubs. At another meeting exactly one week later the Federation organized the Girard Library Association.

Philip Trevor Kerslake  (born 24 May 1959) is a Welsh-born New Zealand speaker, author and television presenter who has appeared on the weekday morning series, Good Morning and in other New Zealand media. He is also a cancer survivor. Biography Kerslake experienced symptoms of a lymphoma at age 14 or 15, and when he was 19 in 1979, he was given a terminal prognosis. He wrote of his experiences in the 2006 book Life, Happiness... and Cancer: Survive with action and attitude! . The book continues (at 2020) to sell in bulk to cancer support NGO's and others who distribute the work to new patients to help them potentially achieve better outcomes from their treatments. The book was published in Australia in 2008 and in Africa and Poland in 2010, each through different publishers. It was later published in paperback in Australia by Fontaine Press, and as an e-book through Amazon.com in 2013.

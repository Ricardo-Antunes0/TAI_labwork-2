"Indiana Wants Me" is a song written, composed, and originally recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter R. Dean Taylor. It was released on the Rare Earth label, a subsidiary of Motown Records, in 1970, and was a top ten hit in both the US and UK.  In Cashbox magazine, the single hit #1. The song spent two weeks at #2 in Canada. The song is written from the viewpoint of someone who has murdered a man who insulted his woman; he is missing his family and hiding from the police, who eventually catch up with him. Taylor wrote and composed the song after watching the movie Bonnie and Clyde. In addition to writing, composing, and originally recording the selection, Taylor produced the record and arranged it in collaboration with David Van De Pitte. It was released on the Rare Earth label, formed by Motown in an attempt to establish itself in the rock music market. The police siren sounds at the start of the record were removed from some copies supplied to radio stations after complaints that drivers hearing the song on the radio had mistakenly pulled over, thinking that the sounds were real.

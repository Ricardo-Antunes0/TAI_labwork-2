LAByrinth Theater Company is a non-profit, Off-Broadway theater company based in New York City. The company was founded in 1986 by director/producer David Esbjornson and actor/director and choreographer Patricia Birch.  LAByrinth is known for its innovative productions, often using nontraditional theater spaces, as well as its strong focus on the creative process and its commitment to creating work that is both challenging and accessible to a wide audience. The company has produced more than 50 productions, including such acclaimed titles as "The Cripple of Inishmaan", "The Glass Menagerie", "A Midsummer Night's Dream", "King Lear", and "The Merchant of Venice".  In addition to its own productions, Labyrinth has collaborated with other theaters on joint productions, most notably the critically acclaimed "King Lear" trilogy (which received five Tony Awards), which was created in collaboration with the Shakespeare Center at the University of California, Berkeley.  LAByrinth has been honored with numerous awards, including a Pulitzer Prize for Drama (for "King Lear"), a Tony Award for Best Director (for David Esbjornson for his production of "King Lear"), a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Director of a Play (for David Esbjornson), and an Obie Award for Best New American Play (for "A Midsummer Night's Dream").

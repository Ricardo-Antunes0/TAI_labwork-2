"Crazy Girl" is a song recorded by the Eli Young Band, an American country music group. It was released in March 2011 as the fifth single of their career, and the first from their album Life at Best. It won song of the year at the 2012 ACM Awards. Content Liz Rose co-wrote the song with Curb Records artist Lee Brice. According to Rose, the idea for the song came after the two began talking about how "females[…] have our crazy moments". Of the opening stanza, Rose said, "I know I've had those relationships on both sides, where you wanted to tell somebody[…]'Why don't you just chill? I'm not going anywhere!" Brice added that the song's melody "just took us to a place. It was kind of a sensitive kind of song, but it still had this edge to it that was really cool." He also thought that Rose was "good" at writing with a new artist such as him. Bassist Jon Jones said of the song, "Any time you find one [song] that's written a little differently, that's good."

George (died 359) was the bishop of Laodicea in Syria from 335 until his deposition in 347. He took part in the Trinitarian controversies of the fourth century. At first an ardent admirer of the teaching of Arius and associated with Eusebius of Nicomedia, he subsequently became a semi-Arian, but seems ultimately to have united with the Anomoeans, whose uncompromising opponent he had once been, and to have died professing their tenets. George was a native of Alexandria in Roman Egypt. In early life he devoted himself with considerable distinction to the study of philosophy. He was ordained a presbyter by Bishop Alexander I of Alexandria. Having gone to Antioch, he endeavoured to mediate between Arius and the orthodox catholic church. To the Arians he shewed how, by a sophistical evasion based on  (τὰ δὲ πάντα ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ), they might accept the orthodox test (Θεὸν ἐκ Θεοῦ). The attempt at reconciliation completely failed, and resulted in his deposition and excommunication by Alexander, on the ground of false doctrine and of the open and habitual irregularities of his life. Athanasius styles him "the most wicked of all the Arians", reprobated even by his own party.

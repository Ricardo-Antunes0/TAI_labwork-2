There are several different experimental techniques that can be used to measure the shaking of an object during an earthquake. One common technique is to use a shaking table, which is a platform that can be suspended from the ceiling and has a movable arm that can be used to measure the shaking of the object. The shaking table is typically mounted on a base that is able to move, which allows the shaking of the object to be measured over a period of time.

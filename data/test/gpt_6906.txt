Qakare Ini (also Intef) was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the 11th Dynasty during the late Second Intermediate Period. He succeeded to the throne after the death of his predecessor, Mentuhotep II, in c. 1145 BC.  Qakare Ini is well known under his Hellenized name Intef I, because he restored several monuments of the Old and Middle Kingdom during his reign. Most notably, he restored the main temple of Amon at Thebes and built a new temple at Karnak. Intef I was also responsible for the construction of a few small temples at Nubia, including one at Jebel Barkal. He also started the construction of a massive tomb at Abydos, which was never completed.  Qakare Ini was buried in a large tomb in Abydos that was started by his predecessor, Mentuhotep II. The tomb was designed by Intef's father and completed by Intef I. It was decorated with images of many of the king's campaigns in Syria and Palestine as well as scenes from his life in Luxor.

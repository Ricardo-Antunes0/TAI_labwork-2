John Womack, Jr. (born August 14, 1937) is an American economist and historian of Latin America, particularly of Mexico, the Mexican Revolution (1910â€“1921) and Emiliano Zapata.  In June 2009 he retired from his post as the Robert Woods Bliss Professor of Latin American History and Economics at Harvard University. Womack was born in Norman, Oklahoma, in 1937 to John Womack Sr., also a historian. He graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University in 1959 and became a Rhodes Scholar at Merton College, Oxford. In the 1960s he returned to Harvard to earn a Ph.D. in history, doing research that gave him international prestige and his most famous book: Zapata and the Mexican Revolution (1969). His dissertation earned him a place at Harvard as an assistant professor of Latin American History. The published monograph was nominated for a National Book Award in 1970 and he was named to the Robert Woods Bliss Chair in Latin American History, first held by Clarence Haring. Womack has focused on modern Mexican history, with interests in Cuban and Colombian history, leading research in agrarian, industrial, and labor history. After his monograph on Zapata, which inspired many other scholars to pursue projects on grassroots rural history, he shifted his focus to urban working-class history. In 1978, he published an article in the short-lived (1978-80) and largely unavailable journal Marxist Perspectives on the Mexican economy during the Revolution. His article in the Cambridge History of Latin America was anthologized in Mexico Since Independence. In 1999, he published an article on the Moctezuma beer brewery. In 2005, he published a long article assessing the state of labor history. His 1999 anthology of documents Rebellion in Chiapas: An Historical Reader places the Chiapas struggle in a historical perspective back to the 16th century.

A battle or battaile was a division-sized engagement between armies or fleets of equal or greater size. The term is derived from the medieval French word bataille, meaning "battle". A battle was generally considered to be a large-scale combat involving hundreds or thousands of troops, and was fought over a wide area.  From the early medieval period until the Age of Enlightenment, battles were almost always decisive, and many historians regard them as the most important aspect of warfare. The majority of battles in history have been between forces of at least two countries, although there have been some limited cases where single armies have fought each other. Battles between two smaller armies were less common, because prior to the Industrial Revolution they were more expensive to fight, and could result in a Pyrrhic victory for the loser.  The art of war involves techniques such as positioning oneself with respect to the enemy, employing terrain to one's advantage, and striking at the enemy's weaknesses. Many battles involve an element of chance, as the outcome may not be determined until after the fighting has begun. Battles are fought for a variety of reasons: to gain territory, to seize riches, to defend a vital position, or to defeat an opposing army.

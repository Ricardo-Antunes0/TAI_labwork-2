Frederick Martin (12 October 1861 â€“ 13 December 1921), also known as Fred Martin and Nutty Martin, was an English professional cricketer who bowled left-arm medium-pace spin. Martin played first-class cricket between 1885 and 1892, primarily for Kent County Cricket Club, and appeared twice in Test matches for the England cricket team. He was considered one of the best left-arm spin bowlers in the country between 1889 and 1891. Martin was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in the 1892 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. He took six wickets in both innings of his Test debut in 1890, the first time any player had taken two five wicket hauls in his debut Test match. His 12 wickets for 102 runs in the match were the best match figures for a debutant in Test cricket at the time and remained so until 1972. They remain the best match figures for an England player on debut. He took 100 first-class wickets in a season six times and took four wickets in four balls playing for MCC in 1895.

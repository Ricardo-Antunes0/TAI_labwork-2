The Band, הלהקה, (also known as The Band: The Last Waltz) is a 1976 American epic historical drama film directed by Martin Scorsese and produced by Robert Evans. It was written by Scorsese and Michael Cimino and stars singer-actors Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, Roger Daltrey, and Richard Manuel as well as Robbie Robertson, Levon Helm, Rick Danko, and Garth Hudson.  The Band performs at the last concert of its farewell tour. The show is a success until tensions flare between Bob Dylan and Roger Daltrey. Richard Manuel quits the band in frustration. Robbie Robertson has had enough and leaves to join the Grateful Dead. The remaining members finish the show.   The Band was generally well-received by critics and won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. In 2004, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

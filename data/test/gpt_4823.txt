Oxidative deamination is a form of deamination in which the amino group of an amino acid is oxidized. This process is used to produce peptides and proteins from proteins.  Oxidative deamination is a common process in the biosynthesis of proteins and peptides. It is used to produce peptides and proteins from larger proteins. The amino group of an amino acid is oxidized to form a molecule called an oxoamide. This oxoamide can then be combined with another molecule to form a new protein or peptide.

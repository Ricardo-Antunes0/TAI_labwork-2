Gregory (Port Gregory until 1967) is a town located in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia. The town is situated in the Shire of Kalamunda, about 135 kilometres east-northeast of Perth, and has a population of about 1,000 people.  The town was founded by Scottish immigrants in 1887 as Port Gregory, and was later renamed after General Sir George Grey Gregory, a British officer who served in India and Egypt during the Victorian era. Gregory is well known for its wineries and produce, which has been exported to countries such as the United States and Japan. The town is also home to the Western Australian Museum, which was opened in 1974.

Hurricane Greta, later Hurricane Olivia, was one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record, and one of the deadliest hurricanes in United States history. It made landfall in Florida on September 3, 2004, as a Category 4 hurricane, and caused extensive damage across the state. Greta later made a second landfall in Louisiana as a Category 5 hurricane on September 8. In all, Greta killed more than 260 people, injured over 1,500 others, and caused $27 billion in damage.  The origins of Greta can be traced back to a well-organized area of low pressure that developed over the eastern Caribbean Sea on August 28. The system gradually strengthened while tracking westward and was named Greta by the National Hurricane Center on September 1. The storm attained hurricane status early the next day and quickly intensified, reaching Category 4 status by September 3. Greta reached its peak intensity with winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) before making landfall near Panama City Beach, Florida. After moving inland, Greta weakened rapidly and dissipated over Tennessee on September 7.  Greta affected a wide area of the United States, causing severe damage from Florida to Louisiana. The hurricane killed at least 260 people, making it one of the deadliest US storms ever. In Florida alone, Greta caused $27 billion in damage â€“ making it the costliest US hurricane ever. Significant damage also occurred in Louisiana, where Greta made landfall as a Category 5 hurricane.

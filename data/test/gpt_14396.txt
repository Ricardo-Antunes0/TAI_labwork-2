The oldest human settlement in Central California is the Painted Cave of the Volcanic Hills, which was occupied from 10,000 to 8,000 BP. The first known inhabitants of Central California were the Hohokam, who built large earthen mounds near present-day Phoenix. The arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century marked the beginning of European settlement in Central California. In 1821, Jedediah Smith and his party of American explorers discovered gold on the American River near Sacramento. This led to a period of intense mining and settlement in Central California. In 1849, a group of settlers led by John Sutter established Sutters Fort near present-day Sutter's Mill in Colusa. During the Mexican-American War, California was part of the US State of Mexico. The US annexed California in 1848, and Central California became part of the United States. Central California is rich in natural resources, including oil, natural gas, and minerals.

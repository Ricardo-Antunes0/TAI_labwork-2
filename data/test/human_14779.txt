Dawn Rider is a 2012 American Western film starring Christian Slater, Jill Hennessy and Donald Sutherland. It is a remake of the 1935 John Wayne film The Dawn Rider. Plot Cincinnati John Mason, who says he has never been to Cincinnati, visits his father in Promise, Wyoming in 1883. His father is not happy to see him, but they do get to spend some time together before the father is killed by a masked gang robbing the mail. Mason's friend Rudd needs $5000 to save his ranch and he doesn't care how he gets it, even putting the ranch before his sister Alice. Mason wants to find this gang because they killed his father, while a bounty hunter named Cochrane is after Mason. One way to attract the gang, and to possibly save Rudd's ranch, is the payroll for railway workers which is being delivered to Promise and must be taken from there to the railroad.

Tee-ball (also Teeball, Tee ball or T-ball) is a sport in which two teams of nine players each ball around a diamond playing for points. The object is to score more runs than the opposition.  Tee-ball is a descendant of baseball, and shares many of the same rules and gameplay. However, there are some key differences. For one, Tee-ball is played with smaller, harder balls that are not covered in seams, making it easier to hit them far. Additionally, Tee-ball players do not wear protective gear like gloves and helmets, relying instead on agility and reflexes.  Despite these differences, Tee-ball is a popular sport all over the world. It is especially popular in countries with cold climates, where playing baseball outdoors can be too dangerous in winter. In addition to its popularity as a recreational activity, Tee-ball has been used as a training ground for professional baseball players.

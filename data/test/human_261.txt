LT PGB is an abbreviation for a family of Chinese built precision guided munitions named Fury Precision Guided Bomb (Lei-Ting Jing-Que Zhi-Dao Zha-Dan, 雷霆精确制导炸弹) developed by Luoyang Electro-Optics Technology Development Centre (EOTDC), a subsidiary of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC).  Alternatively, LT PGB is also referred by its laser guidance, as Fury laser-guided bomb (Lei-Ting Ji-Guang Zhi-Dao Zha-Dan, 雷霆激光制导炸弹), or LT LGB. LT PGB is actually an upgrade kit to modernize gravity bombs with precision / laser guidance.  The weapon is often erroneously referred as a possible Chinese copy of Russian KAB-500L, but in reality, the origin of this weaponry was actually developed from American Paveway instead.  Samples of unexploded Paveway I were provided to China by North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, as with the targeting pods from downed American aircraft, and China decided to reverse engineer the American precision guided munition in the late 1970s.  However, due to the Chinese industrial and technological limitations at the time, it would take more than a decade to for the Chinese equivalent of Paveway I to complete.  However, after evaluations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Chinese military decided that a weapon of Paveway I class was not adequate, and the weapon did not enter mass production.  A more capable version of the Paveway II class was developed, and was judged to be adequate by the Chinese military, and entered mass production.  This model entering mass production was designated as LT-2, where the LT designation had begun, and thus there was no LT-1, according to the EOTDC spokesman.  LT-2 utilizes the exact bang–bang control just like the American Paveway II.

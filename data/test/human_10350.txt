Paddle dolls are a type of ancient Egyptian female figurine that have been excavated from various tombs. Paddle dolls have been found in burials from the late Sixth Dynasty to the Thirteenth Dynasty from tombs in Asasif, Beni Hassan, Naga el-Deir, Rifeh, Sheikh Farag and Thebes. The period of their greatest popularity seems to have been the late Eleventh and early Twelfth Dynasties. Form  Paddle dolls are made of thin pieces of wood which depict the torso of a woman with truncated arms and no legs. Thick “hair” is represented by small beads strung along string, which are often made from black mud. The necks often are adorned with collars, and the torso with a patterned textile or other jewellery. The breasts and pubic triangle are painted on and Morris notes that "extraordinary prominence given to the pubic triangle" and "pubic triangles are the one constant in the iconic repertoire of the paddle dolls." They will often also have tattoos in diamond shapes, and in the forms of deities or animals. One such example is a frog found on the reverse side of a paddle doll now at the Egypt Centre, Swansea.

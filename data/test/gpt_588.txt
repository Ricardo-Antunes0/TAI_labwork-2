The Song-Đại Việt war, also known as the Đại Việt Civil War, was a protracted conflict fought from 1945 to 1954 between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV, also known as North Vietnam) and the Republic of Vietnam (RVN, also known as South Vietnam), with China and the Soviet Union providing military support to one side or the other.  The war is considered one of the deadliest in human history with an estimated 1.5 million fatalities, making it the deadliest conflict in Asia, and the second deadliest in the world after World War II. The fighting largely took place in rural areas, with a significant number of battles taking place in forested regions.  The war ended with a North Vietnamese victory on April 30, 1975, when the DRV was reunified under Hồ Chí Minh's rule as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The conflict had a profound impact on Vietnamese society, resulting in massive population losses and a lasting legacy of social dislocation and economic stagnation.

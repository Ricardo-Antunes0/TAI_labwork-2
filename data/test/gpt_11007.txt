The Universal Logistics Standard is a strategic framework for the management of global supply chains. It is designed to improve coordination and integration across different modes of transportation, storage, and distribution, and to create a common standard for tracking and reporting information about the status of a shipment.  The Universal Logistics Standard was developed in response to the challenges faced by companies operating global supply chains. These challenges include the difficulty of tracking shipments and understanding theStatus of shipments. The Universal Logistics Standard addresses these challenges by providing a framework for coordination and integration across different modes of transportation, storage, and distribution.  The Universal Logistics Standard is composed of four main elements: a transportation model, a warehouse management system (WMS), a product data management system (PDMS), and a shipment tracking system (STS). The transportation model provides a structure for describing the various modes of transport used in a supply chain. The warehouse management system enables companies to track the status of products in their warehouses and to communicate information about products to other parts of the supply chain. The product data management system enables companies to manage product information such as specifications, images, and descriptions. The shipment tracking system enables companies to track the status of shipments throughout their supply chains.  The Universal Logistics Standard has been adopted by many organizations including Dell, FedEx, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Samsung, and Unilever. The Universal Logistics Standard is being developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO).

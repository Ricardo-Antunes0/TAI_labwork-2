An animal bite is a wound, usually a puncture or laceration, caused by the teeth. An animal bite usually results in a break in the skin but also includes contusions from the excessive pressure on body tissue from the bite. The contusions can occur without a break in the skin. Bites can be provoked or unprovoked. Other bite attacks may be apparently unprovoked.  Biting is a physical action not only describing an attack but it is a normal response in an animal as it eats, carries objects, softens and prepares food for its young, removes ectoparasites from its body surface, removes plant seeds attached to its fur or hair, scratching itself, and grooming other animals. Animal bites often result in serious infections and mortality. Animal bites not only include injuries from the teeth of reptiles, mammals, but fish, and amphibians. Arthropods can also bite and leave injuries. Signs and symptoms Bite wounds can cause a number of signs and symptoms Generalized tissue damage due to tearing and scratching Serious hemorrhage if major blood vessels are pierced Infection by bacteria or other pathogens, including rabies Introduction of venom into the wound by venomous animals such as some snakes Introduction of other irritants into the wound, causing inflammation and itching

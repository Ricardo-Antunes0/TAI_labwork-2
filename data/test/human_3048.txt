Rammstein Tour 2016 is the unofficial name for Rammstein's first concert tour after a three-year hiatus. It was the series of concerts played by the band on summer festivals (mostly in Europe, but also in North and South America). The only exception were concerts played in Berlin, because these concerts were not part of any festival. Rammstein were also one of the headliners of Southside Festival, but their performance fell through after the cancellation of the two final days of the festival. History  In November 2015 Rammstein announced they would headline a range of international festivals in summer 2016. More shows were gradually confirmed at the beginning of 2016. The show in Wroc≈Çaw was exceptionally announced by organizers. In April 2016 they announced two shows in Berlin, but due to the immense demand the band confirmed an additional show in Berlin. In May 2016 Rammstein confirmed their shows in South America.

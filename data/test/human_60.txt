Judy Reed Edworthy is Professor of Applied Psychology, in the School of Psychology at the University of Plymouth, whose specialty is psychoacoustics and human factors. Her work has centred on auditory alarm implications throughout different areas. Her studies seek to improve auditory alarms. She is a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences and has collaborated with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). Career Edworthy's two main areas of research interest are the applied cognitive psychology of sound and the psychology of music. Her main interest in the field of applied psychology is the design, application and underlying theory surrounding the use of alarms in different environments. She has worked on alarm designs for vehicles such as trains and helicopters, but her main work has been on specific high-workload applications such as medical alarms in operating theatres. Here, she carries out both research and commercial design work. Her second area of research is in the cognitive psychology of music, and her current interest lies in the aesthetics of popular song, particularly the impact of complexity, repetition, and song structure on the enjoyment of popular song. She also has interests and publications in the psychology of visual warnings.

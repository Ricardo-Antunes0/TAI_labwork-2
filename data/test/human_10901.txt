The Flirts were a project concept group formed by Bobby "O" Orlando to further front his performances as an artist, musician and songwriter. The group consisted of  Orlando and featured an ever revolving roster of female session singers and models. Under The Flirts name, Orlando churned out hits "Passion", "Danger", "Helpless" and "Jukebox (Don't Put Another Dime)". Concept and first chart success Orlando conceived the idea for The Flirts, wrote the songs, played the instruments, and produced the tracks. He then auditioned girls to be the faces of the group. Orlando often called in the services of professional session singers to sing the female vocals for the tracks because most of the performers were trained as dancers, models or actresses. The Flirts went through numerous lineup changes and with every album release and tour, some girls left while others stayed. Orlando released six studio albums under The Flirts name from 1982â€“1992 and numerous singles.

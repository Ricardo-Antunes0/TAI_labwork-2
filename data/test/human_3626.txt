David McCulloch (5 October 1912 – 21 June 1979) was a Scottish footballer who played for several Scottish and English clubs in the 1930s, most notably Heart of Midlothian, Brentford and Derby County. He also represented Scotland at full international level. Biography  McCulloch, a striker, began his senior career with Third Lanark, whom he joined from junior side Shotts United in 1932. After two years at Cathkin Park, he was signed by Hearts for £530, moving east at the same time as his Thirds teammate John MacKenzie. His first season at Tynecastle was notable, as he scored 38 times (at an average of a goal per game) to top the First Division scoring charts. Such a goal-scoring ratio helped Hearts to both a third-place finish and increased attendances, although Double-winners Rangers proved too strong in the Scottish Cup semi-finals. Costs incurred by work to improve Tynecastle's facilities and capacity were proving a financial millstone and in November 1935, the Hearts board indicated that certain players were available for transfer. McCulloch was by this stage one of five Scotland players on the club's books, having made his debut against Wales a year earlier, and an obvious transfer target. After numerous expressions of interest from English clubs, McCulloch and international teammate Alex Massie were sold to offset the debt, McCulloch joining London side Brentford for a club record incoming fee of £6,000.

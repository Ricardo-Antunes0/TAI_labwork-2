Today, chimney sweeps still maintain a thriving business by cleaning and servicing chimneys. Chimneys are the primary means of distributing smoke and fumes from a fireplace, and cleaning them regularly keeps the home free of harmful smoke and soot.  Chimney cleaning is a service that is provided by professional sweepers who use a variety of methods to clean the chimney. These methods may include using a ladder to reach the top of the chimney, using a special device to access the flue, or using a bucket and brush. The sweepers will usually clean the chimney once a month, although this may vary depending on the severity of the build-up.  If you have concerns about your chimney's condition, or if it appears that it needs to be cleaned, contact a professional chimney sweep to assess the situation. They will be able to advise you on the best way to clean your chimney, and will also be able to provide you with a quote for the service.

He did a year of wrestling at Marshalltown High School and started boxing training when he was fourteen. He loved combat sport so much that when his local boxing gym closed down, he travelled one and half hour each trip to other gym to get his boxing practice. He later transitioned to MMA training at a friend's basement and switch to his uncle's garage.

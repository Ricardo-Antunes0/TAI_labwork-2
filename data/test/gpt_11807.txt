Twelve ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS Scout, beginning with the first ship, HMS Scout, launched in 1755. The majority of the ships have been decommissioned and scrapped, with only one, HMS Scout (D41), remaining in service.   The ship was originally designed as a sloop of war for use as a patrol vessel off the British coast. It was one of the first vessels to be armed with a carronade and was also the first ship to be fitted with a jib mast. The ship served during the Seven Years' War and the American War of Independence. After the war it was used as a training ship and was involved in the suppression of the Jacobite Rebellion in 1796.   The ship was sold to the Chilean Navy in 1818 and served until 1833. It was then sold to the Ottoman Navy and renamed Hayreddin Barbarossa. It served until it was decommissioned in 1854. HMS Scout is currently preserved at the Royal Navy Museum at Greenwich, London.

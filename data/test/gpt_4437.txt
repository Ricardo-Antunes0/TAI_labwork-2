Thomas Gascoigne (1404–1458) was an English medieval scholar and writer.  Born in Northampton, he was the son of a wealthy clothier. He attended the University of Cambridge from 1424 to 1429, where he studied under John Wyclif and William of Ockham. In 1437, he became a fellow of the college, and in 1440 was appointed rector of Thrapston.  Gascoigne is most famous for his work on rhetoric and poetry, which include "The Oracion of Homily XXVII" (1439), "The Works of Thomas Gascoigne" (1453–1458), "The Art of English Poesie" (1468), and "The Mirror for Magistrates" (1476). He also wrote treatises on law, ecclesiastical history, and medicine.  Gascoigne died in 1458 at the age of 49.

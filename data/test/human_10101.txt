The Glamorgan Yeomanry was a Yeomanry regiment of the British Army originally raised in the late eighteenth century as a result of concern over the threat of invasion by the French. It was re-raised in the Second Boer War and saw service in both World War I and World War II. The lineage is maintained by C (Glamorgan Yeomanry) Troop, 211 (South Wales) Battery, 104th Regiment Royal Artillery. French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars After Britain was drawn into the French Revolutionary Wars, Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger proposed on 14 March 1794 that the counties should form a force of Volunteer Yeoman Cavalry that could be called on by the King to defend the country against invasion or by the Lord Lieutenant to subdue any civil disorder within the county. The attempted French landing in South Wales in 1796 (the Battle of Fishguard) gave renewed impetus to the recruitment of Yeomanry, and the Glamorgan Yeomanry Cavalry was raised in 1797. However, the Yeomanry was allowed to decline in the years following the Battle of Waterloo and the last of the Glamorgan troops were disbanded in 1831.

Frederick Merrill Tibbott (December 11, 1885 â€“ August 20, 1965) was an American football player and novelist. He played college football while attending Princeton University and was a consensus selection at the halfback position on the 1908 College Football All-America Team. Tibbott was born in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1885, and moved with his family to Philadelphia in 1901. He attended the Germantown Academy, where he was a member of the football, baseball and track teams. He played halfback for the Princeton Tigers football team in 1907 and 1908. In October of 1907, he ran 100 yards for a touchdown against Bucknell. In November of 1907, Tibbott scored a touchdown and helped Princeton defeat the Carlisle Indians, starring Jim Thorpe, by a 16-0 score. One newspaper wrote of Tibbott's performance against Carlisle: "Tibbott was the slim, wiry Tiger who did most of this work. He played superb football for Princeton on the offense and was a man of might out of all proportion to his bounds."

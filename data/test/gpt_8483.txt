The toy piano, also known as the children's piano, is a keyboard instrument designed for children aged 3 years and younger. It has a smaller keyboard than an adult piano, and its strings are tuned to a lower pitch.  The toy piano is a popular instrument for children because of its portability, affordability, and the fact that it is easy for them to learn how to play. It is also a good instrument for teaching young children music theory because of its limited range and simple chords.

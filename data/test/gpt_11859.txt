The Ryder Cup is a biennial men's golf event contested by teams of golfers from the United States and Europe. The first Ryder Cup was played in 1927 at Royal Liverpool Golf Club in England.  The Ryder Cup is contested between two teams of players, each consisting of 12 players. The teams are divided into two groups, with four players from each team playing in each group. The team with the most points at the end of the four matches played in each group is the winner of the Ryder Cup. If the two teams are equal on points, then the team with the better record in singles matches is the winner. If both teams have an equal record in singles matches, then the team with the better record in doubles matches is the winner.  The Ryder Cup is one of golf's most important tournaments and is considered one of the world's major events. The competition has been held every two years since its inception, with exceptions for World War II and the Korean War. The United States has won 23 of the 36 Ryder Cups contested, while Europe has won 16.

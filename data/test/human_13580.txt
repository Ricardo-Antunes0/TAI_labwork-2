Dortmund-Dorstfeld is an S-Bahn station in Dortmund in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It the second most important S-Bahn node in the city after Dortmund Hauptbahnhof. It has four above-ground tracks, which are accessible via two island platforms and two underground tracks that are accessible via side platforms. The station is classified as a category 3 station. It is served by Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn lines S1, S2 and S4. Significance  The station is served by three lines of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn, the S1 from Dortmund to Solingen, the S2 from Dortmund to Herne (and continuing to Recklinghausen or Essen) and the S4 from Dortmund-Lütgendortmund to Unna. All three lines are operated by DB Regio NRW and run at 30-minute intervals (15-minute intervals in the peak on the section through Dortmund-Dorstfeld). The station is a railway junction and is particularly important because line S4 uses an historic route (the Welver–Sterkrade railway, which was built by the Royal Westphalian Railway Company) and therefore does not run through the current Dortmund Hauptbahnhof. S4 services running from Unna and S2 services running from Dortmund Hauptbahnhof therefore wait at the station to allow interchange; similarly S4 services running from Lütgendortmund and S2 services running from Herne also wait. Interchange is possible in each case across the same platform. The S1 runs through an underground station and is connected by stairs and lifts with the platforms of the other lines.

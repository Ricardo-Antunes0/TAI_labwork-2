The Hyundai Pony (Hangul: 현대 포니), was a subcompact car manufactured by the South Korean automaker Hyundai from 2005 to 2009. The Pony was Hyundai's first entry into the small car market in over a decade, and competed with the Kia Rio and the Suzuki Swift.  The Pony was based on the Hyundai Elantra compact car, but was smaller, with a wheelbase of 2,795 mm (109.4 in), shorter length (4,711 mm or 166.5 in), and a lower height (1,445 mm or 56.1 in). It was also built on a new platform that was more rigid and had a wider range of engine and transmission options. The Pony was powered by a 1.6-L engine that produced 84 hp (63 kW) and 88 N·m (57 lb·ft) of torque, or by a 1.8-L engine that produced 104 hp (78 kW) and 102 N·m (70 lb·ft) of torque. A 2.0-L engine was also available for some models. All models came standard with an automatic transmission and front-wheel drive.   The Pony was discontinued in 2009 after only four years on the market.

History  The group was formed in Oslo in 2006, when three acquaintances, Kleppe, Nybru and Lillehamre, formed a rockabilly band after realizing they shared a passion for 50s music. After a round of drinks and discussion, they came up with the name the Lucky Bullets. They soon began writing and performing their own songs, playing clubs and minor arenas in the Eastern part of the country. In 2008 the line-up was completed with guitarist Even Lundqvist. That same year they performed to rave reviews at by:Larm, where they played the main stage.

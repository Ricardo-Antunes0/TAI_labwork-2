The Syro-Roman law book (or Syro-Roman code) is a codex of imperial Roman law, comprising over one thousand articles, dating from the 5th to the 7th centuries AD. The work is organized into thirty-six titles, each dealing with a specific legal area.  The Syro-Roman law book was discovered in 1857 by a group of monks in the monastery of St. Simeon Stylites in Syria. It was subsequently brought to the attention of scholars, and was first published in 1876.  The Syro-Roman law book is a valuable source of information on Roman law during the Early Middle Ages. It has been used extensively by scholars to reconstruct the history of Roman law and its development.

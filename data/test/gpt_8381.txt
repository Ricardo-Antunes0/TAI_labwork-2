Astreptorhachis is an extinct genus of Late Cretaceous temnospondyl amphibian that lived in North America. It is known from a single species, Astreptorhachis longicaudatus.  Astreptorhachis is the most basal temnospondyl genus known from North America, and is among the earliest representatives of the group to occur in the continent. The genus was first described by American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in 1875, based on a single specimen—a nearly complete skeleton—from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana. A second species, Astreptorhachis simplicidentatus, was described from a nearly complete skeleton from the Niobrara Formation of Kansas. The genus was again redescribed by German paleontologist Ernst Stromer in 1906, based on additional specimens from the Hell Creek Formation.  Astreptorhachis is known from a single species, Astreptorhachis longicaudatus. This species is known from a nearly complete skeleton—the type specimen—from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana. The only other specimens of Astreptorhachis known from North America are a partial skeleton and skull from the Niobrara Formation of Kansas.

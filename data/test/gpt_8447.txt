Labor discrimination as defined by Kenneth Arrow is "the practice of treating people differently in employment, because of their membership in a particular social group." This can manifest itself in a number of ways, such as hiring practices, wages, benefits, and promotions.  There has been a long-standing debate surrounding the existence of labor discrimination. Some argue that it does not exist at all, while others contend that it is a problem that must be dealt with. The issue is particularly complex and controversial, as it can involve subjective judgments about what constitutes discrimination.  Arrow's theorem is an important tool in understanding labor discrimination. It states that there is no relationship between the amount of discrimination and the level of economic efficiency or productivity. This theorem has been used to support the argument that labor discrimination does not exist, as it would lead to inefficient allocation of resources.

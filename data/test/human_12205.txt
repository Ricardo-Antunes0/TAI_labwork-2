Paul Hockenos (born 1963) is a Berlin- and New Yorkâ€“based writer and political analyst who has been working in Germany and across Central and Eastern Europe since 1989. His work has appeared in The New York Times, Newsweek, The Nation, Foreign Policy, the New Statesman, The Christian Science Monitor and The Chronicle of Higher Education, among other periodicals. He has authored several books on European politics. Biography Hockenos grew up near Skidmore College, in Saratoga Springs, NY, where his father, Warren Hockenos, was a professor of philosophy. He earned a BA in political science from Skidmore in 1985, then traveled to Germany and, for a time, studied political science at the Free University, in West Berlin. Subsequently, he completed a master's degree in social and political thought at the University of Sussex, England. In the summer of 1989, while hitchhiking to Budapest, he observed how masses of East Germans were crossing the border from Communist-controlled Hungary into Austria (one of the turns of events leading up to the fall of the Berlin Wall); his writing about what he witnessed marked the beginning of his journalistic career.

Connelly v DPP [1964] AC 1254 was a landmark case in the law of England and Wales which established the principle of double jeopardy.  The prisoner, Connelly, had been convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The prosecution appealed against the conviction on the grounds that he had been tried twice for the same offence. The court unanimously held that this constituted double jeopardy and quashed his conviction.

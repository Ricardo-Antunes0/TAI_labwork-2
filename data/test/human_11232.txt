Linden Park, officially known as Park of the Americas, is a  park located in the center of the Corona neighborhood of Queens, New York City. It has stood out as a green square block on maps since the village of West Flushing was first mapped out in 1853, long before the village became the suburb or urban neighborhood known as Corona. History The residents of Corona, known as West Flushing before 1872, often held events such as summer band concerts in this park. In 1893, a school was built across the street from the park, which was later designated as P.S.16. The event that turned Corona from a suburb into an urban neighborhood was the construction of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company's Flushing Line (now the New York City Subway's ) to 103rd Streetâ€“Corona Plaza station on April 21, 1917. To commemorate this event, local dignitaries and residents held a celebration that night in Linden Park with a concert.

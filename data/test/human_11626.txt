Hamaya is an arrow given at Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples as a Japanese New Year's lucky charm or sacred tool. Sometimes set with a bow called a Hama-yumi. In addition to this, bows and arrows are set up on top of the building facing the demon's gate as a curse during the topping ceremony when a new house is built. It is also customary for relatives and acquaintances to give Fuma-ya or Fuma-bow to newborns for their first birthday . It is said to have originated from bows and arrows used in an event called "Jalai", which was held on New Year's Day to test archery skills. Originally, the word "hama" referred to the target used in the event. The arrows used to shoot these targets were called "Hama arrows" and the bows were called "Hama bows. As "Hama" means "demon," the custom of giving toys made of bows and arrows to families with boys at New Year's was born. Later, it came to be given at Hatsumodes as a lucky charm to bring good luck for the year .

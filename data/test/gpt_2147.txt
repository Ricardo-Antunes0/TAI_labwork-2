'68 Comeback is an American garage rock band, formed in 1968 in Los Angeles, California. The band was considered one of the first psychedelic rock bands.  The band was formed by singer/guitarist Rick Derringer, who had played with the Los Angeles-based garage rock band the Outlaws. The group's lineup also included drummer Randy Meisner, bassist David Freiberg, and keyboardist John "J.D." Vincent. The group released its self-titled debut album in 1969, which featured the singles "Green Grass and High Tension" and "Psychotic Reaction".  The group toured extensively throughout the early 1970s, and its second album, "Bare Essence", was released in 1972. The album featured the hit single "Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy". However, the band's popularity waned in the late 1970s, and the group disbanded in 1978.  Derringer reformed the band in 2001, and they released their fifth album, "Garage Inc.", in 2004. The band has continued to tour throughout North America and Europe since then.

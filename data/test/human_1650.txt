The eastern barbastelle or Asian barbastelle (Barbastella darjelingensis) is a species of vesper bat found throughout much of Asia, from Afghanistan to Taiwan. Taxonomy  It was described by Brian Houghton Hodgson in 1855, and was previously thought to be a subspecies of the Arabian barbastelle (B. leucomelas), with B. leucomelas being previously known as the eastern or Asian barbastelle when it contained B. darjelingensis. However, a 2008 study, and several later genetic analyses, found B. leucomelas to be a distinct species from B. darjelingensis, and thus split them both. The American Society of Mammalogists, IUCN Red List, and ITIS all follow the results of this study. Further genetic studies indicate that B. darjelingensis itself contains many cryptic lineages that could represent distinct species, but this is disputed due to all most populations having similar morphology to one another. However, the Caspian barbastelle (B. caspica) and Japanese barbastelle (B. pacifica) are indeed thought to represent distinct species and have been split as such by the ASM and ITIS, with the IUCN also acknowledging them but not yet providing a conservation status.

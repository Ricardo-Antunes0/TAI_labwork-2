Tristano Codignola (; Assisi, 23 October 1913 – Bologna, 12 December 1981) was an Italian politician. Biography Son of Ernesto Codignola, pedagogist and manager of the Florentine publishing house La Nuova Italia, and Anna Maria Melli, Tristano Codignola was born in Assisi in 1913. After graduating in law in 1935, he devoted himself a lot to the company inherited from his father of which he was first director (1936) and managing director then (1945); in January 1942 he was arrested for activities against the fascist regime and in June was sentenced to political confinement in the prison of Florence and then of Lanciano, from where however he left in November thanks to an amnesty, even if supervised by the OVRA. He was a prominent exponent of liberal socialism and therefore among the founders of the Action Party (which brought together associations such as Justice and Freedom), formed in 1943 by politicians who like him had fought Nazifascism, and of which he was the representative during the Italian civil war, actively participating in the Florentine Resistance. Following the killing of Giovanni Gentile, while not sparing severe criticism of the figure of the philosopher and his adhesion to the Italian Social Republic, he took a tough position against the authors of the attack on the illegal paper La Libertà of 30 April 1944.

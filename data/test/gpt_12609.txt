Snaresbrook Crown Court is a historic, Grade I listed, Crown Court located in the Royal Borough of Greenwich, London.  The court was originally built in 1772 as the Old Palace of Justice on the site of the present-day Royal Courts of Justice. The Palace of Justice was designed by George Dance the Elder and built by John Moore and it was destroyed by a fire in 1814. The new court was designed by George Dance the Younger and built by Benjamin Ferrey between 1816 and 1819. The court became known as Snaresbrook Crown Court in 1938, following the amalgamation of the Middlesex and Surrey courts.  The court is used for trials relating to criminal law, including murder, rape, robbery, burglary and theft. It also hears civil cases, such as divorce, bankruptcy and inheritance.

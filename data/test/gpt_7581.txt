Gazi Husrev-beg's Hanikah (from the Persian hanegah meaning "miracle") is a legendary event that supposedly took place on the night of 23 December 1413 in the Ottoman Empire.   According to legend, Gazi Husrev-beg, the leader of the Ottoman army, was resting at his home in Sivas after a victorious battle when an angel appeared to him and commanded him to go to the town of Hanikah, which was under attack by the Byzantine Empire. Husrev-beg rode to Hanikah and single-handedly defeated the Byzantines, thus winning the town for the Ottomans. The story has been retold many times over the years and has become a popular folktale in Turkey.

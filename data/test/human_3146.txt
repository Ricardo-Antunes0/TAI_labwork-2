John, surnamed Mystacon, "the mustachioed", (, fl. 580–590), was a prominent East Roman (Byzantine) general in the wars with Sassanid Persia during the reigns of Byzantine emperors Tiberius II (r. 578–582) and Maurice (r. 582–602). Biography A native Thracian, John first appears in history as a general in Roman Armenia in 579, along with Cours. If not already holding the post of magister militum per Armeniam at that time, he had been elevated to it by 582, when he was named magister militum per Orientem by the newly crowned Maurice. Soon after this, possibly in autumn 582, he fought a major pitched battle with the Sassanid Persians under Kardarigan near the junction of the rivers Nymphius (modern Batman) and Tigris. In this battle, John commanded the center, while his old colleague Cours commanded the right wing and general Ariulf the left wing. Initially the battle went well, the center and left pushing the Persians back, but Cours did not follow up, allegedly due to his jealousy of John, causing the East Roman army to retreat in defeat. After another defeat during an unsuccessful siege of the fort Acbas, he was replaced (in late 583) by Philippicus.

Demodex bovis, also known as the cattle demodex, is a parasite that lives on the skin of cattle. It is a relatively small parasite, measuring only 1 mm in length.  Demodex bovis is the most common external parasite found on cattle, and is responsible for the most cases of mastitis in cattle. The parasite lives in pores on the skin, and feeds on the host's blood. Demodex bovis is a protozoan, and is able to enter the body through wounds or mucous membranes. Once inside the body, it can spread to other organs, including the brain.  The symptoms of Demodex bovis infection vary depending on the location where the parasite resides on the skin. In general, however, mastitis is a sign that Demodex bovis is present. Mastitis occurs when milk contains too much bacteria, and is a common problem in dairy cows. Demodex bovis can also cause skin lesions, which can lead to secondary infections.  There is no known cure for Demodex bovis infection, and treatment typically involves antibiotics. However, prevention is key to preventing mastitis in cattle, and proper hygiene practices are essential. Barrier creams that kill bacteria can be used to prevent mastitis in dairy cows, while routine de-worming treatments can help control demodex infestations in livestock.

Extreme Characters (also known as brink users, superusers, or powerusers) are users who use their privileges excessively, often to the detriment of others.  Users who are classified as extreme can be difficult to manage and may require special attention. They can be a major challenge for any system, and can often cause significant damage.  There is no one definition of an extreme user, but generally they are users who use more privileges than is necessary, or than is allowed by the system. They can be very aggressive and disruptive, and can often ignore or even abuse warnings or admonitions from system administrators.  Extreme users can present a serious security risk to systems, and can be a major challenge for anyone trying to manage them. If not managed carefully, they can quickly become a drain on resources and a source of frustration for everyone involved.

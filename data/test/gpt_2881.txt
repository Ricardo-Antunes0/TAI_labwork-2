Archaeobiology, the study of the biology of archaeology, is a rapidly growing field with a growing number of researchers interested in the interactions between human and environmental factors in the archaeological record. The study of human and animal remains at archaeological sites can provide information on past diet, health, lifestyle, and behavior. Additionally, the examination of ancient architecture and settlement patterns can provide insights into the cultures that inhabited a region.

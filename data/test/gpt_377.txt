Neural coding is the transduction of environmental information into neuronal signals within the brain. Neural coding is a fundamental process for understanding the behavior of organisms and for constructing models of neural function.  Neural coding is a fundamental process for understanding the behavior of organisms and for constructing models of neural function. The neural code is a set of rules that govern how individual neurons communicate with each other to produce a functional nervous system. How these rules are encoded and accessed is still largely unknown, but it is likely that they are based on the statistical properties of recorded neuronal activity.  This process of encoding information into neuronal signals is critical for understanding how the brain works, as it allows us to model neural function and understand the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Neural coding has been implicated in a wide range of complex behaviors, including learning, memory, locomotion, and decision making. It is also likely to be important for disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and autism spectrum disorders, as these conditions involve problems with learning and memory.

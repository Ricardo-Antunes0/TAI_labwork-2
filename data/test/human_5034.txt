Hans Horst Meyer (March 17, 1853 – October 6, 1939) was a German pharmacologist. He studied medicine and did research in pharmacology.  The Meyer-Overton hypothesis on the mode of action on general anaesthetics is partially named after him.  He also discovered the importance of glucuronic acid as a reaction partner for drugs, and the mode of action of tetanus toxin on the body. Life Meyer was born in Insterburg, East Prussia (now Chernyakhovsk, Russia). He studied medicine in Königsberg, Leipzig, Berlin and again in Königsberg. After his promotion to Doctor of medicine in Königsberg he worked with Oswald Schmiedeberg, one of the founders of pharmacology as an independent scientific discipline, in Strasbourg. In 1881 he was appointed to the Chair of Pharmacology in Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia). Also in 1881, he married Doris née Boehm. Together they had three sons, Kurt Heinrich (1883–1952), Arthur Woldemar (1885–1933) and Friedrich Horst (1889–1894).

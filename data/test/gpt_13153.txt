Noah's Ark (; Biblical Hebrew: Tevat Noaá¸¥) was a large wooden vessel, described in the Hebrew Bible as being built by Noah and his sons after the Great Flood of Noah. The ark was constructed to survive a global flood and carry a pair of every kind of animal, along with their food and water containers, onto the ark. Once the floodwaters receded, God directed Noah to release the animals from the ark onto the new earth.  Noah's Ark is a central feature of the Abrahamic religions, and is mentioned in the Quran. In Christian tradition, it is considered an important symbol of faith and is referenced in both the New Testament and theBook of Genesis. The ark is celebrated in numerous annual festivals worldwide.

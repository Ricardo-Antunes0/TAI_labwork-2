Charles Edward Dixon (December 31, 1898, Jersey City, New Jersey â€“ October 21, 1951, Los Angeles, California) was an American jazz trumpeter and bandleader.  Dixon played trumpet and led his own big band from the early 1920s to the early 1940s. He recorded extensively for Vocalion, Capitol, and Decca in the 1930s and 1940s. After World War II he led a small group in Los Angeles.  Dixon was an important figure in the development of bebop jazz and cool jazz. He is particularly noted for his melodic playing on trumpet and his arrangements.

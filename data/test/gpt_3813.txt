Takfiri (,  lit. "excommunicational") is a term used to describe a person who engages in religious violence with the intent to harm others, typically fellow Muslims. Takfiri beliefs and practices are considered deviant by mainstream Sunni Muslims.  The term is most commonly used to refer to Sunni Muslims who believe that it is permissible to kill fellow Muslims who fall outside of their purview, typically because they adhere to beliefs considered heretical by the orthodox Sunni Muslim community. The term is also sometimes used to refer to Shia Muslims and other groups which are seen as apostates by Sunni Islam.  Takfiri movements have been active throughout the Islamic world for centuries, but their current prominence can be traced back to the late 1990s, when al-Qaeda and other militant Sunni Islamist groups began promoting takfirism as a means of expanding their own power. Takfiri violence has been responsible for a number of high-profile attacks across the Muslim world, including the September 11 attacks in 2001 and the 2004 Madrid train bombings.

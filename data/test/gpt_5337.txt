Joseph Gurwin (June 13, 1920 â€“ September 16, 1991) was an American mathematician and computer scientist.  He was born in New York City in 1920, and died in 1991. Gurwin received his B.A. from Brown University in 1941, and his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1946. He worked at Bell Labs from 1946 to 1969, where he developed the first digital computers and became one of the pioneers of modern software engineering.  Gurwin's work on software engineering led to a new approach to computer programming, known as object-oriented programming. His textbook "Introduction to Computer Science" is still considered a classic in the field. Gurwin also made significant contributions to algebra, number theory, and mathematical logic. In 1992, he was awarded the IEEE Medal of Honor for his contributions to computer science.

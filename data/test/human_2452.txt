Grean is a multi-instrumentalist; he plays guitar, bass, keyboards, mandolin, lap steel, and banjo. He is most noted for morphing electric guitar sounds, unique and highly stylized. "I’m constantly trying to wring new and exciting voices from the sometimes-mundane electric guitar,” Grean explains. "Some end up sounding very ambient, but others sound like synthesizers, or like string sections." His hallmark rock production sound often incorporates electronic music and horns, as well as traditional Americana instruments such as accordion, hammer dulcimer.

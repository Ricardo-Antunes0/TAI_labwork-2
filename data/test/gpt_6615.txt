A random leg course race, also known as a mass start or a sprint, is an event in which competitors run a fixed distance (usually 800 meters) as quickly as possible.  A mass start race is typically conducted as a single-elimination tournament, with the first competitor to cross the finish line being declared the winner. A sprint race, by contrast, is typically a more traditional form of competition in which all competitors run the same distance – typically 400 meters – and the first competitor to cross the finish line is the winner.

The common starfish, common sea star or Aplysia californica, is a species of starfish found in both temperate and tropical oceans.  The common starfish is a small to medium-sized sea star. It typically has a disc-shaped body with five arms extending from it. The disc is flattened on the bottom and has a central ridge. It can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The arms are edged with serrated edges and may be up to 20 cm long. The common starfish is a colonial organism, with thousands of individuals sharing the same space.  The common starfish feeds on algae, plankton and other small organisms that it catches with its feeding tentacles. It sometimes eats small fish or sea urchins. The common starfish can reproduce sexually or asexually. In sexually reproducing species, the male produces spermatozoa which are deposited on the female's fleshy peduncle. After fertilization, the larvae develop into new adults. In asexual reproduction, individual cells divide without the need for fertilization.

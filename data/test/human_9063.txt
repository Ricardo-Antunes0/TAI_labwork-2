The Geelong West Giants, nicknamed the Giants, is an Australian rules football and netball club based in the suburb of North Geelong, Victoria. The club fields teams in both the Geelong Football League and Geelong & District Football League. History  The Geelong area's first new club since 1990 was born out of the merger of the town's two oldest teams, Geelong West St Peters Football Club (the Roosters, also known as "Red West") and Geelong West Sporting Club (the Cheetahs, also known as "Blue West"). With both Geelong West clubs having sustained periods of minimal success in recent years, it was decided by both sets of members to pursue a merged entity. The Giants now field senior football teams in the GFL and GDFL, both respective competitions of their predecessors, while also operating junior football, senior netball and junior netball teams.while also having a mixed all abilities netball team to support people with disabilities.

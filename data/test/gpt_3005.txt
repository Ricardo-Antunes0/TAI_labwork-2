Johann Andreas Streicher (13 December 1761 in Kirchheimbolanden â€“ 10 December 1834 in Vienna) was an Austrian writer, journalist and publisher who is best known for his antisemitic tracts.  Streicher was born into a peasant family in the Austrian province of Styria. After completing elementary school, he became an apprentice printer in Graz. In 1784, he moved to Vienna, where he worked as a journalist and published his first book, a history of the Austrian Netherlands.  In 1791, Streicher established the "Austrian News Chronicle" as a daily newspaper. The publication became known for its virulent antisemitism, which Streicher exploited to appeal to the basest instincts of the Viennese population. He also published a number of pornographic pamphlets, which brought him much notoriety.  In 1819, Streicher was sentenced to six months in prison for sedition after he published a pamphlet accusing the Austrian emperor of being a Jew. He died two years later in Vienna.

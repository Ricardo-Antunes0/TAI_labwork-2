Country Thunder Saskatchewan (formerly the Craven Country Jamboree) is an annual country music festival, held in the Qu'Appelle Valley, near Craven, Saskatchewan, Canada. History  The event was first held in 1983 as the Big Valley Jamboree, with Roy Orbison as a headline act. The event was originally founded by Roman Catholic priest Lucien Larré as a fundraiser for his youth housing charity Bosco Homes. A historic feature of the festival has been the "Gopher Run", a rush seating line where up to 3,000 spectators can bring their own chairs for the front row. In the late-1980's, the Jamboree came under government oversight due to an abuse scandal involving Larré. In 1993, the Jamboree was sold to the Alberta-based Vinco Foods, who began to hold a sister event in Camrose, Alberta. By then, the event had begun to see declines in ticket sales and revenue, leading to changes such as a cap on ticket sales, and replacement of the "Gopher Run" with reserved "VIP" seats in 1995.

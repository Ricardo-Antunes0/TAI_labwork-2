V-type proton ATPase catalytic subunit A is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the "ATP6V1A" gene.  The V-type proton ATPase catalytic subunit A protein is a regulatory protein that is important for energy production in mitochondria. This protein is also involved in the transport of metabolites between cells. Mutations in this gene can lead to a variety of mitochondrial diseases.

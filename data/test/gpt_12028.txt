X2 (also marketed as X2: X-Men United) is a 2003 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics X-Men character X2. It is the sequel to 2000's X-Men and the second installment in the X-Men film series. The film was directed by Bryan Singer and written by Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter.  Set ten years after the events of the first film, Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters has been shut down and the mutant population is estimated at less than 100 people. A group of mutants led by Magneto (Michael Fassbender) plan to raise the mutant population and create a new world order. They are opposed by Professor X (James McAvoy), a wheelchair-bound telepath who founded the school and trains a new generation of mutants to use their powers for good.  Principal photography began in December 2002 in Queensland, Australia and ended in March 2003. The visual effects company Digital Domain created over 600 visual effects shots for the film, which took more than six months to complete. The soundtrack was composed by James Horner, who also scored the first film. The film premiered on May 14, 2003 at Comic-Con International in San Diego and was released in the United States on July 14, 2003. It grossed over $262 million worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 2003.   A sequel, X-Men: Apocalypse was released on May 27, 2016.

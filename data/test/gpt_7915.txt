Abraham S. Fischler (January 21, 1928 – April 13, 2016) was an American mathematician who made significant contributions to the theory of operator algebras, functional analysis, and mathematical physics.  Fischler was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1928. He studied at the City College of New York, where he received his bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1950. He then went to the University of California, Berkeley, where he completed his doctoral studies in 1955 under the supervision of Abraham Robinson.  After completing his doctorate, Fischler worked at the University of Chicago for a year before moving to the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1956. He remained at UCSB for the rest of his career, becoming a full professor there in 1966. In 1997 he was awarded the prestigious Fields Medal by the International Mathematical Union.  Fischler died on April 13, 2016 at the age of 88.

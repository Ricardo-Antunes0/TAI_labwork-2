In Spain, the denominación de origen (; English: "origin designation") is a system of classification used to regulated the production and marketing of wines. The system was introduced in 1936, and replaced the earlier appellation system.   The denominación de origen is based on the geographical origin of the grape variety used to produce a wine. A variety may be classified in one or more categories, including dry reds, dry whites, rosés, sweet wines, sparkling wines, and fortified wines. A wine may also be classified according to its alcohol content (standard wine, fortified wine, etc.), or according to its producer (monastic winery, family-owned winery, etc.).

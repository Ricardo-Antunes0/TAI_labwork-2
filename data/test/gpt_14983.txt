Fort Maurepas was the name of two forts in what is now eastern Quebec, Canada. The first, built in 1750, was located on Île aux Noix (Noix Island), just north of the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River, opposite Fort Frontenac at Quebec City. The second, built in 1778, was located on the banks of the Saint Lawrence River about 12 km (7.5 mi) south of Quebec City.  The forts played an important role in the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War. In 1759, Fort Maurepas was attacked by the British and was captured after a prolonged struggle. In 1760, it was recaptured by French forces under Montcalm and converted into a prison for British prisoners of war. In 1775–76, it was used as a base for operations against Quebec City by American forces under General George Washington. In 1778, after the Battle of Montreal, British forces under General John Burgoyne attempted to retake Quebec City from the French by crossing the St Lawrence River at Fort Maurepas. However, French forces under General Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vaudreuil defeated them at the Battle of Saratoga that same year and Burgoyne was forced to retreat to New York.

Karl Franz Josef Bělař ( lit. "whitewasher" in Czech, "Charles White" in English) (20 November 1778 – 5 September 1863) was a Czech composer and pianist.  Karl Franz Josef Bělař was born in Prague on 20 November 1778, the son of a wine merchant. He began his musical education at the age of six, studying piano with his father. In 1793 he entered the University of Vienna to study law, but he soon abandoned this ambition and concentrated on his musical career. He won several prizes as a pianist and in 1803 made his first public appearance as a composer at a concert in Prague. In 1805 he became music director of the National Theatre in Prague, a post he held until 1829.  During his tenure as music director of the National Theatre, Bělař composed many operas, operettas and incidental music for plays. His most famous work is the opera "The Barber of Seville", which premiered in 1818 and became enormously popular. Other notable works include the opera "The Marriage of Figaro" (1809), the oratorio "David" (1838), and the symphonies "No. 1" (1819), "No. 2" (1829) and "No. 3" (1841).  Bělař retired from his post as music director of the National Theatre in 1830, but continued to compose until his death five years later.

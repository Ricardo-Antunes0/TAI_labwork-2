Al-Burdayni Mosque  is a mosque in Cairo, Egypt. It is located in Al-Dawoudia, near the Mosque of al-Malika Safiyya. It was built by a wealthy merchant, Kareem al-din al-Bardayni in 1616 during the Ottoman rule. The building is made of stone and has gates erected in 1629 on two sides on the west, right of the fountain. This mosque was built under Ottoman rule after the Ottomans defeated the Mamluks in 1517 and ruled over Egypt until 1867. The mosque is built in Mamluk style not Ottoman style which would have been the prevailing style of choice at the time. This is because Karim al-Din al-Burdayni did not align himself with the cultural practices of the Turks neither the Egyptians. Description Although the mosque was built in the Ottoman era, the architecture retains many of Mamluk style, including the fountain which is full of motifs and inscriptions. Al- Burdayni mosque is small in scale and L-shaped making the mosque visible from two different faces both serve as entryways. To the right of the mosque is where the minaret stands. The minaret is where many different Islamic architectural styles come together. The first tier of the minaret is octagonal in shape with carvings of triangular arches, the second tier circular with vegetal motifs classic to Islamic architecture, finally a bulb like structure rests on the top with muqarna or stalactites like ornament around it.

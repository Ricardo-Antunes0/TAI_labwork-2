The  voyageurs  were 18th and 19th century fur traders who travelled the great rivers of North America, such as the Missouri and Columbia, in order to trade furs with the Native Americans.   The voyageurs were essential in the development of North America. They helped to open up the continent for European settlers, and helped to develop the transportation network that is still in use today. They also played a significant role in the exploration and settlement of Canada and the United States.

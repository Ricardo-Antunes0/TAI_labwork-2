Social comparison bias is the tendency to have feelings of dislike and competitiveness with someone seen as physically or mentally better than oneself. Introduction A majority of people in society base their moods and feelings on how well they are doing compared to other people in their environment.  Social comparison bias happens in everyday society regularly.  Social comparison bias can be defined as having feelings of dislike and competitiveness with someone that is seen as physically or mentally better than yourself.  This can be compared to social comparison, which is believed to be central to achievement motivation, feelings of injustice, depression, jealousy and people's willingness to remain in relationships or jobs.  People often compete to get the best grades, the best jobs and the best houses.  In many situations, social comparison bias is fairly self-explanatory.  For example, one might make a comparison between the low-end department stores they frequent and the designer stores of their peers, such comparisons may elicit feelings of resentment, anger and envy with that peer.  This social comparison bias involves wealth and social status.  Some of us make social comparisons, but are largely unaware of them.  In most cases, we try to compare ourselves to those in our peer group or with whom we are similar.

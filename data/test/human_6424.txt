Yvonne McCain (1948 - 2011) was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit, which led to a landmark ruling in 1986 by the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan, stating that New York City could not deny emergency shelter for homeless families with children. However, the case was not settled until 2008, when it was settled by New York City and the Legal Aid Society. The McCain case was settled in 2008 in the Boston v. City of New York case, and the settlement upheld the legal right to shelter for homeless families and children. Lawsuit  The lawsuit in which McCain was the lead plaintiff, which was a class-action suit filed in 1983, was initially called McCain v. Koch, referring to mayor Ed Koch, but the name of the lawsuit changed as new mayors of New York City took office. In 1983, McCain was homeless and had children, and had been placed by New York City at the welfare hotel Martinique, which had poor conditions. She had been evicted from her apartment in 1982 after refusing to pay rent because her landlord refused to make repairs. She was a battered woman, and as she moved from city-supported apartments to shelters and back, her husband once found her and broke her nose.

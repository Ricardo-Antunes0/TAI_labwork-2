Dissolved gas flotation (DGF) systems are used to recover various types of minerals, including heavy oil, bitumen, and natural gas. The process works by using a rotating drum to suspend the mineral-containing solution in a gas-phase suspension. The gas is then bubbled through the suspension, breaking down the mineral molecules into smaller pieces.   Dissolved gas flotation has been used for over 50 years to recover various minerals. The technology is widely used in mining and oil and gas production, especially for heavy oil and bitumen. The process works by using a rotating drum to suspend the mineral-containing solution in a gas-phase suspension. The gas is then bubbled through the suspension, breaking down the mineral molecules into smaller pieces.

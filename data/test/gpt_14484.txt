Self-categorization theory is a theory in social psychology that suggests people use social categories to organize and understand their own thoughts and experiences.  The theory states that people use social categories to make sense of their thoughts and experiences. These social categories can be things like "I," "you," "friend," or "enemy." People use these social categories to understand their own thoughts and experiences, as well as the thoughts and experiences of others.  The theory has been used to explain a variety of phenomena. For example, the theory has been used to explain why people tend to group things together. The theory has also been used to explain why people are more likely to remember things that are associated with a particular social category.

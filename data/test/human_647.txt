Family Radio, also known by its licensee name Family Stations, Inc., is a non-profit, non-denominational, educational Christian radio network based in Franklin, Tennessee with network operations located in Alameda, California, United States. Established in 1958, Family Radio airs religious music and programming, both past and present, and is listener-supported. Programming Family Radio's music programming consists mainly of traditional Christian hymns and other genres within Christian music. For decades,  Family Radio avoided any types of Contemporary Christian Music and only played traditional. At some points they played small amounts of very light Christian songs from the 70's, but they avoided anything even moderately contemporary, even softer songs within that genre. In the past year, though, softer Contemporary Christian Music from recent years has been added and mixed in with the traditional music. Contemporary Artists being mixed in range from John Michael Talbot, Steve Green, Christine Wyrtson, to Casting Crowns, Mercyme, Chris Tomlin, among others. They play about 4 an hour.

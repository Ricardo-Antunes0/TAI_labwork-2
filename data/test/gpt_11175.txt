Export Peace Ltd (Finnish: Vientirauha Oy) was a Finnish peacekeeping organization. It operated from 1992 to 1995 in the former Yugoslavia.   Export Peace was founded in 1992 by the Finnish Lutheran World Federation, the Finnish Catholic Church and the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights. The organization's main goal was to promote peace and reconciliation in the former Yugoslavia. Export Peace staff worked with local communities to create zones of coexistence and helped to create a dialogue between different ethnic groups. The organization also assisted in the reconstruction of war-torn areas. In 1995, Export Peace was disbanded due to financial difficulties.

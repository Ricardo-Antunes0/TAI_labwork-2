Prabhdeep Singh, better known by his stage name, Prabh Deep, is an Indian rapper, songwriter and music producer from New Delhi, India. He gained recognition in the Indian music industry after the release of his debut album Class-Sikh which debuted at number 2 on the iTunes India albums chart and quickly ranked up to number 1 by the end of the year. Early life Prabh Deep was born in the West Delhi suburb of Tilak Nagar to Jaswinder Kaur, a small-scale businesswoman and Manmohan Singh. His father, Manmohan Singh, had lost his father and four brothers during a killing spree by angry mobs allegedly aided by the Delhi Police and Indian National Congress during the 1984 riots in Nangloi Jat, Delhi. Despite the birth of Prabh Deep in 1993, Manmohan struggled with the post-traumatic stress of the riots and developed addictions. The family was, therefore, supported by the earnings through the hair salon run by Prabh Deep's mother, Jaswinder.

Uma Devi Badi (born 1965) is a Provincial Assembly Member of Sudur Paschim Province in Nepal, elected in 2017. She is a human rights activist and the leader of the Badi movement, which has been actively protesting for the recognition of the rights of its community, including end of untouchability and prostitution, land ownership and citizenship. Early life  Uma Devi Badi was born in 1965 in Thapagaun, in the Salyan District of Nepal. From a young age, she started out life as a prostitute, the only profession available to women of the Badi caste at that point in time. At the age of 21, she married Prem Bhatta, from the Brahmin caste. Their inter-caste marriage created a scandal at the time, since the Badi caste is considered one of the lowest in Nepal and is treated as untouchable. Badi has no children of her own, but instead raised two of her sister's sons.

Calliprora clistogramma is a moth of the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Meyrick in 1914. It is found in India (Assam).  The wingspan is 10â€“12 mm. The forewings are light brown, partly mixed with whitish, the costal edge whitish anteriorly, posteriorly edged dark fuscous. There is an elongate white spot on the base of the costa, and another at two-thirds, as well as a smaller one on the dorsum before the tornus. There is also a broad white streak from near the base of the costa to beyond the middle of the dorsum, continued towards the termen beneath a projection from before the middle of this streak, and thence curved towards it to within two-thirds of its length. The hindwings are pale grey.

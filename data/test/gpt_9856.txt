The Barbados rail is a fossil rail of the family Rallidae. It was first described by American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in 1875 and is endemic to Barbados.  The Barbados rail is a small, slender rail with a long tail. It has a black head, neck, and upperparts, and a white belly. The rail is distinctive for its long, thin legs, which give it a waddling gait. It feeds on insects and other small creatures, and is threatened by habitat loss.

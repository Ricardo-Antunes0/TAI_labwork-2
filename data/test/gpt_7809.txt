Simon David Freeman (January 14, 1926 – May 1, 2016) was an American philosopher who specialized in the philosophy of science and the philosophy of language.  Freeman was born in 1926 in Denver, Colorado. He received his B.A. from Stanford University in 1950, and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1952 and 1957, respectively. He was a professor of philosophy at Yale University from 1967 until his retirement in 1998, after which he continued to serve as a visiting professor there until his death in 2016.  Freeman's work in the philosophy of science focused on the problem of induction, the relationship between theory and observation, and the role of meaning in scientific inquiry. In the philosophy of language, he addressed issues such as the nature of proper names, definability, meaninglessness, and meaning-in-use.  He was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Association for Symbolic Logic, and the American Philosophical Association. He was also a recipient of the Grawemeyer Award for Philosophy of Science (1978), the Langmuir Award (1986), and the National Medal of Science (1996).

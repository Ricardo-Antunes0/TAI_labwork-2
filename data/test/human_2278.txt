KStars supports adjustable simulation speeds in order to view phenomena that happen over long timescales. For astronomical calculations, Astrocalculator can be used to predict conjunctions, lunar eclipses, and perform many common astronomical calculations. The following tools are included:  Observation planner  Sky calendar tool  Script Builder  Solar System  Jupiter Moons  Flags: Custom flags superimposed on the sky map.  FOV editor to calculate field of view of equipment and display them.  Altitude vs. Time tool to plot altitude vs. time graphs for any object.  Hierarchical Progress Surveys (HiPS) overlay.  High quality print outs for sky charts.  Ekos is an astrophotography suite, a complete astrophotography solution that can control all INDI devices including numerous telescopes, CCDs, DSLRs, focusers, filters, and a lot more.

John Spencer Bassett (September 10, 1867 â€“ October 4, 1940) was an American violinist, composer and teacher.  Bassett was born in Louisville, Kentucky, and began his musical studies with his father, a bass-baritone singer. At the age of six he began studying violin with Friedrich Kalkbrenner in Vienna, and later with Antonio Salieri in Milan. He made his debut as a soloist at the age of twelve, playing Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 1 in Vienna.  He later toured Europe with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Henry Wood, playing works by Beethoven, Brahms and Wagner. He also served as professor of violin at the Peabody Conservatory of Music in Baltimore from 1906 to 1910. His pupils included Jascha Heifetz and Yehudi Menuhin.  Bassett's compositions include orchestral works, chamber music, songs and piano pieces. His most famous work is the Violin Concerto (1905), which was commissioned by Igor Stravinsky and won first prize at the Paris Conservatory Competition.

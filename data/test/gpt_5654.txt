Donald Allen Wexler (January 23, 1926 â€“ July 11, 2009) was an American physicist.  Born in New York City, Wexler received his B.A. from the City College of New York in 1948 and his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1953. He taught at Vanderbilt University from 1954 to 1969 and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1969 to 2003. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences from 1969 to 1981, and a fellow of the American Physical Society (APS) and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Wexler's research focused on the theory of weak interactions and had a major impact on our understanding of nuclear physics and chemistry, as well as on particle physics. He was also instrumental in bringing modern statistical methods to nuclear physics research, which has led to improved predictions of phenomena such as radioactive decay, nuclear fusion, and the production of heavy elements.

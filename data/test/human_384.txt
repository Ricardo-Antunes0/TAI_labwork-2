The T-13 was a tank destroyer in use with the Belgian armed forces before World War II and during the Battle of Belgium. It was designed by Vickers-Armstrong, and produced by Vickers, Miesse and  and outfitted with  armament from Fonderie Royale de Canons Herstal. The earlier T-13s were based on imported Vickers tracked vehicles that were outfitted with armament and armor in Belgium by the Miesse company; later versions, from the B3 version on, were fully license-produced in Belgium by the Familleheureux factory. Total production numbers are unclear and have been underestimated for political reasons, both before and after World War II, but are generally estimated at 300 vehicles, although not all were available or fully outfitted on 10 May 1940, the start of the Battle of Belgium. Nazi Germany used the vehicles after the occupation of Belgium, but to what extent remains unclear. History In general - keeping a close watch on German political and military developments - the need for armored tracked vehicles or tanks was widely accepted by the Belgian military establishment. The political view on the matter however was slightly more complex. Bearing in mind how the country had been a battlefield and occupied by Germany during the First World War, the Belgian government  tried to keep Belgium a neutral country from 1936 onwards and therefore out of any European conflict. Politicians from the right wing political parties wanted Belgium to abstain from buying offensive weapons such as tanks and bombers, so as not to provoke Germany into starting a new war; politicians from left wing parties rejected such armament on an ideological basis.

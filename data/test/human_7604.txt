Filip Grabovac or Filip Grahovac (1697/8 â€“ 13 February 1749) was a Croatian Franciscan priest, professor, patriot, poet and writer. Grabovac was born in a village near Podosoje, Vrlika. His schooling was at the Franciscan monastery in Brist. In 1719, he completed his novitiate. After becoming a priest, he spent some years as a lecturer. Then, for twenty years or more he served as a military chaplain of the Venetian army. He had come to reside in Verona but his duty included frequent travels in northern Italy, especially Venice. This work was tough on him, and he suffered great bouts of ill health. His salary, which was the same as that of a soldier, didn't make things better, for he had to look after his horse from that same income. It was due to such diligent work and sacrifices that he became renowned in Verona and by 1747 was one of the province's most revered priests. In 1747, he published a few books in Venice.

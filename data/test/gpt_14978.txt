Wally George (born George Walter Pearch; December 20, 1926 â€“ December 14, 1980) was an American singer and songwriter, best known for his 1961 single "The Girl Can't Help It."  George was born in Abilene, Texas, to a sharecropper family. He learned how to play the guitar at a young age and began performing in local clubs in the late 1940s. In 1951, he signed a recording contract with RCA Victor and released his first album the following year. George's biggest success came with the 1961 single "The Girl Can't Help It," which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song was written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller and became one of the most enduring pop hits of the 1960s. George continued to record sporadically throughout the 1960s and 1970s, but his later work failed to achieve commercial success. He died from a heart attack in Los Angeles in 1980 at the age of 56.

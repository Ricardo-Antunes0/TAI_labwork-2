The Stamp Act of 1712 (cited either as the Stamp Act or the Townshend Acts) was a tax in the British colonies in North America, instituted by the British Parliament to pay for the Seven Years' War. The act imposed a tax on printed materials, including newspapers, pamphlets, almanacs, and playing cards. The tax was repealed in 1766.  The Act met with significant opposition from colonists, who saw it as an attack on their rights and liberties. The British government believed that the act would raise money to finance the war effort and help to quash any potential rebellion. In total, the act raised about £200,000 (approximately £5.3 million in today's money).  The Stamp Act was met with widespread protest throughout the colonies. On October 7, 1765, a group of colonists destroyed a shipment of stamps at the Royal Mail Office in London. This event is often seen as the beginning of the American Revolution.

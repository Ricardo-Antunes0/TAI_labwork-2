"Best Burger" is the fifth episode of the fifth season of the animated comedy series Bob's Burgers and the overall 72nd episode. It was written by Mike Benner and directed by Don MacKinnon. It aired on Fox in the United States on November 30, 2014. Plot Bob enters the first annual Best Burger competition at Wonder Wharf, hosted by Chuck Charles, where he competes against Jimmy Pesto and charismatic celebrity chef Skip Maroosh. The chefs have 20 minutes to cook their burger entries before they are judged by a panel. Skip's entry is the Pomegranate Green Chili Chutney Burger, Jimmy Pesto's is the Oregano Burger, and Bob's is the Bet It All On Black Garlic Burger, which uses an expensive, speciality ingredient: Korean black garlic. Bob is wracked with anxiety, questioning why he entered a competition he knows he will likely lose, and has to deal with constant jabs from Chuck, who still holds a grudge against him for getting him fired from his job as a morning talk show host. Things become worse when Bob realizes that the black garlic is not in their cooler. Bob entrusted Gene to pack it, but Gene became distracted and forgot it on the kitchen counter.

Creosote gall midges are a species of gall midge in the family Cecidomyiidae.  The creosote gall midge, Cecidomyia polyphemus, is a small, slender gall midge that is typically yellow-orange in color, with a black head and thorax. The gall midge larvae are small and gray-white in color, and feed on the leaves and stems of creosote bushes and other desert plants. Creosote gall midges are common residents of the Sonoran Desert, where they are a significant contributor to the stability of creosote bush populations.

Startled Insects, later known as The Insects, are an instrumental English pop-jazz band. History Startled Insects began around 1983 in Bristol, England, as a collective of three producers/multi-instrumentalists, Tim Norfolk, Bob Locke and Richard Grassby-Lewis. Little information has ever been published about the band – the participants' names did not appear on any of the album sleeves, nor were any pictures ever published. Nevertheless, the band managed to generate considerable excitement with their first self-published EP and single, enough that Island Records signed them to their new Antilles New Directions label. Their first album for Island, Curse of the Pheromones (1987), was an underground hit, and the group performed several well-received multi-media tours using film-makers drawn from various backgrounds, such as Frank Passingham, Dave Borthwick, with whom they later produced the sound-track to The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb and Dave Alex Riddett also of Aardman Animations, as well as Richard Kwietniowsi who later directed Love and Death on Long Island. In 1990, they were commissioned by the BBC to score a ground-breaking 90-minute documentary entitled Lifepulse – a Natural Thriller, which attempted to tell the story of evolution on Earth using nothing but BBC Wildlife footage and music. In 1995, they provided the score for another BBC documentary, The Private Life of Plants.

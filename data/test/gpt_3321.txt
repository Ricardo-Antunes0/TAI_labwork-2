HMS Blanche was a 32-gun Hermione-class fifth rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched on 30 September 1786. She was wrecked off the coast of Cornwall on 21 October 1807.  The Hermione class was a series of British warships, designed by Sir John Williams and built at Chatham Dockyard, between 1786 and 1793. The class comprised 32-gun ships with a crew of 720 men. They were named after members of the Royal Family, with HMS Blanche being named for Princess Charlotte, eldest daughter of King George III.  On 21 October 1807, HMS Blanche was in company with HMS Royal George and HMS Orion when they were caught in a severe storm off the coast of Cornwall. The three ships were battered by waves and hurricane-force winds for several days, until they were driven onto a reef near Penzance. HMS Blanche struck a rock and broke in two, while HMS Royal George and HMS Orion were destroyed by the waves. Only six men from HMS Blanche survived the storm; all six died from their injuries within a few days.

Frederick "Fritz" Augustus Heinze  (December 5, 1869 â€“ November 4, 1914) was an American businessman, known as one of the three Copper Kings of Butte, Montana, along with William Andrews Clark and Marcus Daly. He was an intelligent, charismatic and devious character, but was also seen as a hero especially by many of the citizens of Montana. Early life Fritz Augustus Heinze was born in Brooklyn, New York, to wealthy parents, Otto Heinze, an immigrant from Germany and Lida Lacey, an immigrant from Ireland. He was named Fritz but generally went by F. Augustus, and later the name Frederick. He was very bright and had a good education in Germany (from 9 to 15 years of age) and at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute (now part of NYU) and was fluent in various languages. He then graduated from Columbia School of Mines, New York, in 1889. Instead of undertaking further studies in Germany, as his father wished, he headed west to Colorado and Salt Lake City to pursue his interest in mining.

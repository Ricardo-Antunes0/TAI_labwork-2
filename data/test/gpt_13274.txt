Lower Egypt ( ;  Tsakhet) is a historical region in Upper Egypt. It covers the area from Aswan down to Nubia and includes the ancient Egyptian cities of Memphis, Sais, and Thebes.  The region now covers parts of the modern Egyptian governorates of Aswan, Luxor, Sohag, and Beni Suef. It was also known as "Thebes Subregion" during the ancient Egyptian period since it comprised the southernmost part of Upper Egypt.  Lower Egypt was, at times, an independent country as well as an integral part of the Middle and Upper Egypt. It was ruled by a hereditary priestly class known as the Old and Middle Kingdom Egyptians. The region entered into a period of foreign domination by the Hyksos during the Second Intermediate Period (1700â€“1550 BC). From 1550 BC onwards it became an autonomous province ruled by native rulers known as the New Kingdom Egyptians. The campaign of Ramesses II in his second year resulted in the annexation of Lower Egypt into the newly unified Ancient Egyptian Empire.

American R&B recording artist Kelly Rowland began her career in 1997 with one of the best-selling American girl groups, Destiny's Child, who have sold around 60 million records worldwide. Her solo videography includes  three DVD albums, forty nine music videos, six films, seven-teen telefilms and seven television shows. Rowland transitioned into acting with a guest role on the sitcom The Hughleys in 2002, before appearing in other UPN shows such as Eve and Girlfriends in the years of 2003 and 2006. Having played the role of Tammy Hamilton, an apprentice to realtor Toni (Jill Marie Jones) in the sitcom, Rowland initially hoped her three-episode stint would expand to a larger recurring role, but as the show was moved to The CW network the following year plans for a return eventually went nowhere. Also in 2003, she appeared in American Dreams as Martha Reeves of Martha & The Vandellas, singing a version of the group's single "Nowhere to Run".

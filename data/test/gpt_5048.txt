USS Bainbridge (DDG-96) is an  guided missile destroyer of the United States Navy, commissioned in 1993. She is the sixth ship of the "Avenger"-class and was named for Commodore William Bainbridge, who fought in the American Revolution.  The Avenger-class destroyer is a modified version of the Oliver Hazard Perry-class destroyer. The primary difference is that the Avenger-class is equipped with a SPY-1D radar, which gives it an enhanced anti-aircraft warfare capability. Additionally, the class is designed to carry more missiles and torpedoes than its predecessor, which makes it more suited for offensive operations.  Bainbridge has participated in several international operations, most notably Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Southern Watch in Iraq. She has also participated in several high-profile domestic operations, including the response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Bainbridge has been involved in several notable incidents over her career, including a collision with a merchant vessel in 2009 and a fire aboard her in 2013.

German submarine U-661 was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine.  Built at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, U-661 was commissioned on 25 November 1944 under the command of Korvettenkapitän Ernst-Günter Hoffmann. Operating off the coast of Norway, she sank five merchant ships totalling in tonnage before being sunk in a depth charge attack on 21 January 1945. Of the crew of forty-eight, only one survived.  U-661 was one of the last U-boats sunk during World War II.

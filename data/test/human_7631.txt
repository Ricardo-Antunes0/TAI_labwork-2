Dedovshchina (; lit. reign of grandfathers) is the informal practice of initiation (hazing) and constant abuse of junior conscripts during their service, formerly to the Soviet Armed Forces and today to the Russian armed forces, Internal Troops, and (to a much lesser extent) FSB Border Guards, as well as the military forces of certain former Soviet Republics. It consists of brutalization by more senior conscripts serving their last year of compulsory military service as well as NCOs and officers. Dedovshchina encompasses a variety of subordinating or humiliating activities undertaken by the junior ranks: from doing the chores of the senior ranks to violent and sometimes lethal physical and psychological abuse, not unlike an extremely vicious form of bullying or even torture, including sexual torture and rape. When not leaving the army seriously injured, conscripts can suffer serious mental trauma for their life time. It is often cited by former military personnel as a major source of poor morale in the ranks.

Stephen Charles Balboni (; born January 16, 1957) is an American former Major League Baseball player, who played for the New York Yankees, Seattle Mariners, Kansas City Royals, and Texas Rangers. He was a player with home run power and a tendency to strike out. He was nicknamed "Bye Bye" because of his home run hitting prowess. He was also known by the nickname "Bones", which is a malapropism for Balboni. He is also known for the "Curse of the Balboni", an idea written about by Rany Jazayerli which said no baseball team with a player hitting more than 36 home runs for that team could win the World Series.  Since Balboni was the last player to hit 36 home runs and win a World Series, (1985 Royals),  the curse bore his name.  The curse ran from 1985 until Luis Gonzalez and the Arizona Diamondbacks won the 2001 World Series. College career Born in Brockton, Massachusetts, Balboni attended Manchester Memorial High School in Manchester, New Hampshire and Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Florida. In 1976 and 1977, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) for the Falmouth Commodores (1976) and the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox (1977). In 1977, he led the CCBL in home runs (13), was named league MVP, and was also the MVP of the league all-star game at Fenway Park. In 2006, he was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame.

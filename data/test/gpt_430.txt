Conisania is a genus of moths of the family Noctuidae.    The genus Conisania contains only one species, Conisania thalassina, which is found in the Palearctic. The moth is distributed across much of Europe, Asia Minor and North Africa, as well as the Near East and the Caucasus. It is also found in Central Asia. The distribution of the species is patchy and its populations are declining, apparently as a result of habitat loss.

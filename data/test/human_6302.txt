The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is an American mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion company based in Las Vegas, Nevada. It is owned and operated by Zuffa, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Endeavor Group Holdings. It is the largest MMA promotion company in the world and has some of the highest-level fighters in the sport on its roster. It produces events worldwide that showcase twelve weight divisions (eight men's and four women's) and abides by the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. As of 2020, it has held over 500 events. Dana White has been its president since 2001. Under White's stewardship, it has grown into a globally popular multi-billion-dollar enterprise. The UFC was founded by business executive Art Davie and Brazilian martial artist Rorion Gracie, and the first event was held in 1993 at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado. The purpose of the early Ultimate Fighting Championship competitions was to identify the most effective martial art in a contest with minimal rules and no weight classes between competitors of different fighting disciplines. In subsequent events, more rigorous rules were created and fighters began adopting effective techniques from more than one discipline, which indirectly helped create a separate style of fighting known as present-day mixed martial arts. In 2016, UFC's parent company, Zuffa, was sold to a group led by Endeavor, then known as William Morris Endeavor (WMEâ€“IMG), including Silver Lake Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and MSD Capital for US$4.025 billion. In 2021, Endeavor bought out Zuffa's other owners at a valuation of $1.7 billion.

German submarine U-520 was a Type IXC U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine.  The submarine was laid down on 27 September 1941 at the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg, launched on 25 November 1942, and commissioned under the command of Kapit√§nleutnant Werner Henze on 10 January 1943.  U-520 was one of the most successful German submarines during World War II. She sank 29 ships, totaling 114,780 tons, for a total loss of only eight men killed and five wounded. She is also credited with one aircraft captured.  After the war, U-520 was captured by the British and brought to Portsmouth for trial as part of Operation Deadlight. She was finally broken up at Rosyth in Scotland in March 1949.

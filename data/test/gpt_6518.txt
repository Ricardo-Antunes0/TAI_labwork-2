Indo-Martiniquais are an ethnic group of Martinique, a French overseas department. They are the descendants of the French settlers who arrived in the late 18th century. The Indo-Martiniquais constitute about one-third of the population of Martinique.  The Indo-Martiniquais are a people with a long and rich history on their island home. The first Indo-Martiniquais arrived in the late 18th century, fleeing from the then-French colony of Saint-Domingue. These pioneers were largely drawn by the prospect of wealth and opportunity that Martinique offered, as it was then one of the most prosperous colonies in the Caribbean.  Today, Indo-Martiniquais continue to play an important role in Martinique's culture and society. They are a visible minority, making up about one-third of the population but holding a majority in many areas of life. Indo-Martiniquais have also made significant contributions to the arts, sciences, and politics of Martinique.

Crüe Fest was a summer 2008 tour by Mötley Crüe, which commenced on July 1, 2008 and concluded on August 31, 2008. It featured Mötley Crüe themselves, Buckcherry, Papa Roach, Sixx:A.M., and Trapt. Crüe Fest was said to be "the Loudest Show on Earth". The tour earned around $40 million and was the most successful, most popular festival of the summer. Origins The tour was formulated in January 2008 by Nikki Sixx. Shortly afterwards, the idea was established to involve both bands of whom Sixx was then a member: Mötley Crüe and Sixx:A.M. Crüe Fest was born: a new touring festival of 'bands that embody the spirit of rock and roll' in the same vein as Ozzfest. Mötley's official website, , had promised a special announcement and, on April 15, 2008, the band hosted a press conference, where they announced the tour, premiered their "Saints of Los Angeles" video, and performed "Kickstart My Heart" and "Saints of Los Angeles".

Sandinista lanceolatum (synonyms include Aphonopelma lanceolatum and Brachypelma fossorium) is a species of spider in the family Theraphosidae (tarantulas), native to Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Description Sandinista lanceolatum is a relatively small spider compared to many other Central America tarantulas. For a pair of Costa Rican specimens, the author Carlos Valerio described a few select attributes such as cephalothorax less than 18 mm long: being 14 mm in his holotype male and 16 mm in the paratype female. Valerio also indicated that the fourth leg is the longest: 43 mm in the holotype male and 54 mm in the paratype female. The body and legs are covered with reddish brown hairs (setae). The "brush" of hairs (scopula) on the metatarsus of the fourth leg is short, limited to the distal third. The male's palpal bulb is less than 4 mm long; the spermatheca of the female is of slightly less width. Females have larger chelicerae than males. Such attributes are generally not considered as useful subsequent works, for example with males since shown to be highly variable, i.e. see Longhorn and Gabriel 2019.

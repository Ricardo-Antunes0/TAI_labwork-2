Gyromitrin is a toxin and carcinogen present in a number of mushroom species. It is a white to off-white powder that is soluble in water and alcohol. Gyromitrin is produced by some species of mushrooms during their growth and can be found in the mycelium, spores, or gills. The toxicity of gyromitrin is due to its ability to damage DNA. Gyromitrin has been shown to cause cancer in animals and human cells, although the extent of the risk is not well known.

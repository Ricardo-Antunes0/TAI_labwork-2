Smith & Hawken was a garden lifestyle brand that operated retail stores, direct mail and e-commerce in the United States. On July 10, 2009, it was announced that all Smith & Hawken stores would cease operation. Smith & Hawken stores were located in upscale retail locations in 22 states. Smith & Hawken was founded by Dave Smith and Paul Hawken in 1979, originally as a garden tool supplier.  Their first retail store opened in 1982 in Mill Valley, California. Smith left the business in 1988.  When Hawken retired in 1993, the company was acquired by a retail conglomerate, the CML Group, which sold it to DDJ Capital Management in 1999, after going bankrupt.  The company was acquired by Scotts Miracle-Gro for $72 million in 2004.  At the time of its closure, Smith & Hawken had approximately 700 employees in its stores and the Novato, California, headquarters.

Hugo Troll Race is a free-to-play endless runner video game in the Hugo franchise, developed by Danish studio Hugo Games (since 2018 5th planet games) and published by Krea Medie in 2012. Its sequel and spin-off were released in 2015. Gameplay The game is a 3D remake of the 2D "handcar" minigame from the 1992 Amiga game Hugo - PÃ¥ Nye Eventyr (released as just Hugo in an export version outside Denmark), which was itself based on the early 1990s scenarios from the TV game show Hugo. In the game, the player controls a member of Hugo's family escaping a pursuit by the evil witch Scylla and her minions. The player is driving a trolley to jump, dodge and tilt to avoid obstacles and collect gold coins. The gold can be then spent on power-ups and trolley upgrades, and to unlock additional content, all of which can be also bought via microtransactions. There is also a wheel of fortune type minigame.

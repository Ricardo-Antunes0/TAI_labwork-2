The yellow-eared parrot (Ognorhynchus icterotis) is an endangered parrot of the tropics in South America.  It is found in the Andes of Colombia. This species was thought to be extinct up until April 1999, when a group of researchers that were sponsored by ABC and Fundaci√≥n Loro Parque, discovered a total of 81 individuals in the Colombian Andes. It is currently enlisted as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Its current population trend is increasing, in part due to conservation measures implemented to protect the existing populations of the species. It is closely associated with the wax palm (Ceroxylon sp.). Description The yellow-eared parrot is a relatively large, long-tailed parrot, with an average length of  and a weight of about . It is overall green, with the underparts being paler, more lime green than the upperparts. The heavy beak and a ring of bare skin around the eyes are black. The origin of the common epithet "yellow-eared" derives from the yellow patch of feathers that extends from the forehead down to its cheeks and ear-coverts. Its calls sound similar to those of geese.

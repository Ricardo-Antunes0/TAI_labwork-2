The Mitsubishi Tredia is a subcompact sedan built by Mitsubishi Motors from 1982 to 1990. Its name is supposedly derived from Mitsubishi's "Three Diamonds" logo. Alongside the Cordia and Starion, it was one of the first cars imported and sold to America (and Panama) by the company without the involvement of its then partner, the Chrysler Corporation. In Japan, it was sold at a specific retail chain called Car Plaza. Overview Designed to fit between the existing Galant and Lancer models to increase the overall lineup of passenger vehicles, the Cordia and Tredia used front-wheel drive and were similar in design to the contemporary Mirage (although larger). They incorporated a MacPherson strut/independent trailing arm suspension, front disc brakes, manual or electrically controlled automatic transmission, and a choice of three engines: a 1.4 L rated at , a 1.6 L rated at  and a  turbocharged 1.6 L, which was the first such engine to be sold in Japan. The 1600 Turbo received alloy wheels, a hood scoop, and a sticker/stripe combo along the flank. It also benefitted from stiffer suspension than its brethren. Some smaller export markets also received a carb-fed 2.0 L rated at .

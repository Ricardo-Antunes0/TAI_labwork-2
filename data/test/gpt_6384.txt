The Altos 586 was a multi-user microcomputer platform developed by Altos Computer Systems in the early 1980s. The platform was designed to be used in minicomputers, personal computers, and networked systems.  The Altos 586 was originally designed as a low-cost alternative to the Apple II and Commodore PET microcomputers. It was one of the first microcomputer platforms to use an Intel 8086 processor, and its small size and low price made it popular among hobbyists and small businesses.  The Altos 586 remained popular into the 1990s, and was later superseded by the more powerful Intel Pentium platform.

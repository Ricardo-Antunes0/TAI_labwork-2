The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDL-R) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the LDLR gene. The LDL receptor is a nuclear receptor that binds to low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which are small, cholesterol-rich particles that circulate in the blood. The LDL receptor is involved in the process of removing cholesterol from the blood.  The LDL receptor is a key player in the development of atherosclerosis, and mutations in the LDL receptor gene are associated with familial hypercholesterolemia, a disorder that increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. The LDL receptor also plays a role in inflammation and immune function.

The Moniebogue Press was an "alternative" newspaper on Eastern Long Island, New York, United States, that lasted for thirty issues, from July 1971 to October 1972. Based in Westhampton Beach, its free distribution was 7500-15,000. Funded by local advertising, it served the communities of Riverhead, Center Moriches, East Quogue,  Hampton Bays, and Southampton. Its co-founders and  core staff were editor James L. Dudley (1940-2003), publisher/art director Van Howell  (1948-  ) and ad-man/writer/agitator Dean Speir (1940-  ). It was noted for its unpredictable editorial policies; for example, Dudley endorsed the Congressional run of Conservative Party of New York State candidate Robert David Lion Gardiner (1911-2004), the eccentric "16th lord of the manor" of Gardiner's Island, against incumbent Democrat Otis Pike when the Congressman threatened to turn the island into a park. The token Marxist columnist, Richie Marsalla, wrote of the Pope as a Godfather operating a gambling empire - referring to bingo in churches. Other articles exposed conditions in local trailer parks and migrant labor camps. The newspaper also led the successful charge to keep a consortium of real estate speculators and developers from constructing 237 garden apartment condominiums on wetlands on the edge of Moniebogue Bay. Interview subjects included Bo Diddley and an escapee from the Central Islip State Hospital.

Archaeopterodactyloidea (meaning "ancient Pterodactyloidea") is an extinct order of archosauriform dinosaurs.  The order is divided into two suborders, theropod and ornithopod, with 18 families in total. Theropods are the more basal group and include the most famous dinosaurs, such as Tyrannosaurus rex and Velociraptor. Ornithopods are more derived and include the largest dinosaurs, such as T. rex and theropods like Iguanodon.  The order is known from a few specimens, mainly from North America and Europe. The majority of known species were small to medium-sized animals, with some reaching up to 10 metres (33 feet) long. All members of the order were herbivores, although some theropods were carnivorous.

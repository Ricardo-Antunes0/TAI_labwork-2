An optical ground wire (also known as an optical ground shield or ground plane) is a wire or other conductor used to provide an electrical ground connection between two or more electrical devices in a circuit.  An optical ground wire is often used in the context of telecommunications because it can provide an electrical ground reference point that is immune to interference from surrounding electrically-charged objects. In audio and video circuits, an optical ground wire is often used to connect the video signal ground and the audio signal ground.

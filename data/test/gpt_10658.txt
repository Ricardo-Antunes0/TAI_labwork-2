Auke Bay is a neighborhood located in the southeast corner of Juneau, Alaska. It is bounded by the Mendenhall River to the south, the Douglas Channel to the east, and Harding Street to the north. The area is served by Auke Bay Elementary School, which opened in 1969.  The name "Auke Bay" is derived from the Native Athabascan word "Auk'a" meaning "inlet". The bay was first charted in 1794 by George Vancouver, who named it False Bay after a bay he mistaken for Vancouver Island. Auke Bay was later settled in 1881 by members of the Methodist Episcopal Church who established a mission at what is now Park Point. The area was further developed in 1906 with the construction of a wharf and residential areas.  Today, Auke Bay is a diverse and vibrant community with many businesses and homes. The neighborhood is home to many interesting attractions, including the Mendenhall Glacier and Auke Bay Marina. There are also a number of parks and Trails in the area that offer residents and visitors many opportunities for recreation.

Professor Robert Kerford Morton FAA (7 August 1928 â€“ 21 October 2004) was a British biochemist who made significant contributions to the understanding of protein structure and function, particularly in the area of enzymes. He was also a distinguished teacher and researcher at the University of Cambridge.  Morton was born in 1928 in London, England. After completing his undergraduate studies at the University of Cambridge, he spent two years as a postgraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he worked with Professor Melvin Calvin. In 1952, he returned to Cambridge as a lecturer in biochemistry. He became a full professor in 1970, and retired in 1995.  Morton's work on enzymes is particularly notable. He developed the concept of quaternary structure, which is now universally accepted as an important basis for understanding enzyme function. In addition, he developed methods for studying enzyme behaviour in solution and on surfaces, and elucidated the mechanism by which enzymes catalyse chemical reactions.  Morton was a prolific author, publishing more than 200 papers and book chapters. He also served on numerous editorial boards and committees, and was recognised with several awards including the Royal Medal (1996) and the Copley Medal (1998).  Robert Morton died on 21 October 2004 after a short illness.

Dennis Hardy Frederiksen (May 15, 1951 â€“ December 17, 2018) was an American biologist who specialized in plant physiology. He also served as the sixth president of the American Society of Plant Physiologists.  Dennis Frederiksen was born on May 15, 1951, in Des Moines, Iowa. He obtained his undergraduate degree from the University of Iowa in 1973, and his PhD from the University of California, Davis, in 1978. Frederiksen subsequently became a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, before joining the faculty at Oregon State University in 1980.  In 1988, Frederiksen became the chair of the department of plant physiology at Oregon State University. He served in that position until he was appointed president of the American Society of Plant Physiologists in 2001. Frederiksen remained president until his death on December 17, 2018.  During his tenure as president of the American Society of Plant Physiologists, Frederiksen oversaw a number of major initiatives, including the creation of the society's journal "Plant Physiology" and the expansion of its membership to include researchers from around the world. He was also instrumental in developing collaborations between plant physiologists and other scientists working in fields such as genomics and biochemistry.  Frederiksen's research focused on plant physiology and its role in plant biochemistry and growth. His work has helped to further understanding of how plants respond to environmental stresses and how they produce food crops. Frederiksen was also

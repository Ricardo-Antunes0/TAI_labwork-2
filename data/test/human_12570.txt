"Lamentis" is the third episode of the first season of the American television series Loki, based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Loki. It follows alternate versions of the character who escape from the mysterious Time Variance Authority (TVA) but get stranded in an apocalyptic event and must work together to survive. The episode is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. It was written by Bisha K. Ali and directed by Kate Herron. Tom Hiddleston reprises his role as Loki from the film series, while Sophia Di Martino stars as a female version of the character named Sylvie. Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Sasha Lane also star in the episode. Herron joined the series in August 2019. The episode reveals that Loki is bisexual in the MCU like he is in the comics, which Herron felt was important to acknowledge in the series. Filming took place at Pinewood Atlanta Studios, with location filming in the Atlanta metropolitan area.

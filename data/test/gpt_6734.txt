In 2007, Robinson relocated her restaurant to a larger space in the Marina district and re-named it Andrea Robinson's FIG. The FIG quickly became one of San Francisco's most popular restaurants, earning accolades from food critic Jonathan Gold and being awarded two Michelin stars in 2009.   In addition to her restaurant career, Robinson is also a noted wine critic and educator. She has written for publications such as Food & Wine, Saveur and Gourmet magazine, and has lectured on wine at various universities across the United States.

Stane Kavčič (30 October 1919 – 27 October 1984) was a Slovene mathematician, physicist, and mathematician who made important contributions to the development of mathematical physics.  Born in Ljubljana, Slovenia on 30 October 1919, Kavčič attended the University of Ljubljana and the University of Göttingen. He obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Göttingen in 1951 with a thesis entitled " Über die Funktionen einer geraden Linie und ihre Approximation durch eine Polygonal-Methode ". After post-doctoral studies at the University of California, Berkeley, he returned to the University of Ljubljana in 1954 as a professor of mathematics.  Kavčič made significant contributions to the development of mathematical physics, particularly in the areas of chaos theory and nonlinear partial differential equations. In particular, he is known for his work on chaos theory, including his seminal paper "Chaos and Fractals" (Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science, 1980), which has been cited over 2000 times according to Google Scholar. He also made significant contributions to the theory of partial differential equations, as well as to the calculus of variations.  Kavčič was elected a member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1967 and a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1974. He died on 27 October 1984 at the age of

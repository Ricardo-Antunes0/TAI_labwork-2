Eucalyptus muelleriana, commonly known as yellow stringybark, is a eucalypt species that is native to eastern Australia. It is a medium-sized tree that grows to a height of up to 10 metres, and has smooth yellow stringy bark. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and are long and lance-shaped, with a serrated margin. The flowers are white and fragrant, and are produced in groups of three or four on the stem near the top of the tree. The fruit is a globular samara, which is brown when ripe. Eucalyptus muelleriana is an important tree in the Australian forests, and is used for timber, fuel, and resin production.

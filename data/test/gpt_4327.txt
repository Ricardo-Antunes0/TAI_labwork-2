Thomas Sutpen is a focal character of the novel "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. He is the owner of a plantation in Mississippi, and his son, Tom, is the protagonist of the story.  Sutpen stands out from the other characters in "The Great Gatsby" for his wealth and power. He is one of the few people who can actually afford to live in West Egg, a predominantly wealthy enclave on Long Island. Sutpen's wealth is a source of both intrigue and resentment among the other characters.  Sutpen is also an enigmatic figure. He is openly hostile to Jay Gatsby, but it is not clear why. He also has a complicated relationship with his son, Tom. At times, Tom seems to idolize his father and look up to him; at other times, he seems to resent him.

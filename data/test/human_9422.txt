The Normandy-class SR are two fictional spacecraft in the Mass Effect video game franchise. She first appears in Mass Effect as the SSV Normandy SR-1, the product of a joint venture between the human Systems Alliance and the Turian Hierarchy, and described as the most advanced military stealth starship in the galaxy within the series. An improved version of the ship known as the Normandy'' SR-2, though no longer a commissioned spaceship of the Alliance Navy, is later constructed by the anthropocentric paramilitary organization Cerberus and appears from Mass Effect 2 onwards. Both iterations of Normandy have Jeff "Joker" Moreau (voiced by Seth Green) as the pilot in command, while the SR-2 is integrated with an artificial intelligence entity known as EDI (voiced by Tricia Helfer). She functions as the primary means of transport and base of operations for the player, in the role of Spectre Commander Shepard, and their crew, as they travel throughout the Milky Way and fight hostile aliens such as the Reapers. The Normandy has been praised by critics for her visual design, level design, and her appearance in the original Mass Effect trilogy, where she plays a pivotal role in the war against the Reapers and their servants.

The Battle of Ongulumbashe (also known as Operation Blouwildebees) was an armed confrontation between the South African Defence Force (SADF)/ South African Police (SAP) and the South West African People's Organization (SWAPO) in northern South West Africa (today Namibia). Though SWAPO had carried already carried out several attacks in 1965 and early 1966, the battle marked the first time that elements of the South African security forces directly clashed with SWAPO insurgents and is considered to be the start of the South African Border War.

The inaction of the South African's emboldened SWAPO, who had been preparing for an armed struggle against the South African authorities in South West Africa since the early 1960s.

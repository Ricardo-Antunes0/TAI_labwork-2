A waterway is any navigable body of water, usually a river, stream, canal, or sea.  Waterways provide essential transportation and communication links for inland communities and for trade with other countries. They also provide recreational opportunities and are central to the economy of many coastal communities.  Many watercourses are maintained by governmental agencies, non-profit organizations, or commercial interests. Some watercourses are also designated as natural resources important to the environment, such as wild rivers.

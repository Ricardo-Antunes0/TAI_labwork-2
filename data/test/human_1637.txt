Mount Triumph is a summit in the North Cascades range of Washington state. Located approximately  west-northwest of the town of Newhalem, it was named by Lage Wernstedt, a surveyor with the U.S. Forest Service.  A significant peak in North Cascades National Park, Mount Triumph is one of its "outstanding sights" and is well known among regional climbers for its lack of easy climbing routes to the summit. Despite its moderate elevation, its local relief is dramatic. With the terrain deeply dissected by the valleys of Bacon Creek on the west and Goodell Creek on the east, it rises  in less than  on the latter side. The mountain is extremely rugged and one author describes it as "a rock thumb with near-vertical to overhanging faces on three sides." From above, it has the appearance of a three-bladed propeller consisting of the northeast, northwest, and south ridges. Mount Despair  is located  to the north-northwest. The two peaks are connected by Triumph Pass .

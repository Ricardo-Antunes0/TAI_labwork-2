Johannes Kunze was born on March 5th, 1824 in Oschersleben, Saxony. After completing his education at the University of Berlin, he began working as a laboratory assistant to Justus von Liebig. In 1850, he earned his doctorate from the University of Berlin for work on the theory of organic chemistry.  In 1857, Kunze became a professor at the University of Kiel. He remained at Kiel until his death in 1890. During his time there, Kunze also served as the director of the university's chemical institute.

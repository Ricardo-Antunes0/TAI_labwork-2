Maartje Alexander Köster (born 3 March 1975) is a Dutch former cricketer who played as a right-handed batter. She appeared in one Test match and 46 One Day Internationals for the Netherlands between 1995 and 2007, including playing at the 1997 and 2000 World Cups and in the Netherlands' inaugural Test match.  Born in Utrecht, Köster made her One Day International (ODI) debut for the Netherlands at the age of 20, playing two matches in the 1995 edition of the European Championship, hosted in Ireland. At the 1997 World Cup in India, she played in all of her team's matches, but scored only 31 runs from four innings. Köster remained a fixture in the Dutch team throughout the rest of the decade, and began to be used higher in the order, including on several occasions as an opening batter. During the Dutch tour of Sri Lanka in March 1999, she scored what was to be her only ODI half-century, making 58* from 89 balls coming in fifth in the batting order.

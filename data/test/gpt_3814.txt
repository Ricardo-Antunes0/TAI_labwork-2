Analog verification is a methodology for performing the reliability analysis of analog systems. It is a subset of the field of reliability engineering, and is concerned with the determination of the probability that a given analog system will perform as intended in the face of adverse conditions. Analog verification is used to verify the reliability of systems that rely on an analog input, such as medical devices, aircraft engines, and industrial control systems.  Analog verification is a critical part of the reliability engineering process for systems that rely on an analog input. The methodology is used to determine the probability that a system will perform as intended under adverse conditions. This information is essential for ensuring the reliability of these systems. Analog verification often involves performing tests and simulations to determine the system's response to common operating conditions.  Analog verification has been used in a variety of industries for many years. Medical devices are particularly reliant on accurate analog performance, and are often subjected to stringent safety requirements. Aircraft engines are also heavily reliant on an accurate analog performance, and must meet stringent performance standards in order to avoid flight disruptions. Industrial control systems are also heavily reliant on accurate analog performance, and can have a significant impact on plant operations.

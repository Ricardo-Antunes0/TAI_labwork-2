Kensal Town is a residential sub-district of Kensington and Chelsea, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, London, England.  Kensal Town is a large residential area located in the north-west corner of Kensington and Chelsea, just off Ladbroke Grove. The sub-district is bounded by Ladbroke Grove to the south-west, the A4 road to the north-east, and Harrow Road to the east.  The area has a high concentration of expensive residential properties and is home to many celebrities, such as Hugh Grant and Sienna Miller. The area has a high rate of crime compared to other parts of London; however, it has seen recent improvements with the opening of a new police station in 2008.  Kensal Town was originally developed in the late 18th century as a speculative suburb by wealthy landowners and merchants. The name Kensal derives from an old manor on the site of what is now Kensington Palace. The development became fashionable in the mid-19th century and was populated by wealthy middle-class families. The area declined in popularity during the 1960s but has since seen a resurgence in popularity.

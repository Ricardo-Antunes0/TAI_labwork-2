Cremation in Japan was originally practiced by monks seeking to emulate the cremation of the Buddha. Virtually all deceased are now cremated in Japan – as of 2012, it had the highest cremation rate in the world of over 99.9%. The Meiji government attempted to ban the practice in the 19th century, but the ban was only in effect for less than two years. Religion  Cremation in Japan was originally practiced by monks inspired by the Buddha, who gave detailed instructions regarding his own cremation. It was therefore seen as a way of accruing spiritual merit and getting closer to Buddhahood. Cremation also exemplifies the Buddhist teaching of impermanence. Referred to as kasō, which translates to 'fire burial', it is only one of several options mentioned in Buddhist literature, the others being earth burial (dosō), water burial (suisō), open-air burial (fusō, or 'wind burial') and forest burial (rinsō). Water, wind and forest burial accrue the most merit, followed by cremation and then earth burial, which accrues the least merit as it does not offer the body for the benefit of wild plants and animals.  Buddhist relics have been found in the ashes of spiritually meritorious individuals.

Albert Allen Bartlett (March 21, 1923 â€“  September 7, 2013) was an emeritus professor of physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder, USA.  Professor Bartlett had lectured over 1,742 times since September, 1969 on Arithmetic, Population, and Energy. Bartlett regarded the word combination "sustainable growth" as an oxymoron, since even modest annual percentage population increases can represent exponential growth. Over time, huge changes will then occur. He therefore regarded human overpopulation as "The Greatest Challenge" facing humanity. Career Bartlett received a B.A. in physics at Colgate University (1944), and an M.A. (1948) and Ph.D. (1951) in physics at Harvard University. Bartlett joined the faculty at the University of Colorado at Boulder in September 1950. In 1978 he was national president of the American Association of Physics Teachers. He was a fellow of the American Physical Society and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1969 and 1970 he served two terms as the elected chair of the four-campus faculty council at the university. He won the Robert A. Millikan award.

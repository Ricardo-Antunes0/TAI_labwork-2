The Bandicoot class was a ship class of minesweepers of the Royal Australian Navy. The class was designed as a replacement for the ageing L class minesweepers, and entered service in the early 1960s.  The Bandicoot class was a derivative of the successful L class minesweeper. The Bandicoot class had a modified superstructure, with a taller tower providing better all round visibility. The class was armed with two Bofors 40 mm guns, and eight depth charges.  The Bandicoot class served in a variety of roles throughout their service, including patrol and escort duties. The class was decommissioned from the Royal Australian Navy in the early 1990s.

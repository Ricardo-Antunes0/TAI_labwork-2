Anne Cannon Forsyth (August 23, 1930 â€“ May 11, 2003) was an educational activist who created the Anne C. Stouffer Foundation in 1967, which was the first foundation to offer full scholarships for young African-American students to attend elite southern preparatory boarding schools.  She also served as founder and president of the North Carolina Fund. The Anne Cannon Trust awarded $100,000 to Appalachian State University to provide educational scholarships to underrepresented populations. Educational activism  Born into a wealthy family in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Forsyth felt the need to help under-represented people. Specifically, Forsyth was concerned with the problems of poverty and racism. She began her work helping this cause by creating the Anne C. Stouffer Foundation in 1967, which aimed to "promote the integration of southern preparatory schools". Shortly after, John Ehle took over management of the program; Ehle and his wife, the actress Rosemary Harris, can be heard interviewing prospective Black candidates on surviving recordings. The Anne C. Stouffer Foundation largely helped integrate the Virginia Episcopal School in 1967, Bill Alexander and Marvin Barnard were among the first two to attend. Forsyth rationalized starting the program because of the benefits she believed both black and white students would acquire. The foundation over the course of its operation from 1967 to 1975 enabled 142 students, mainly African Americans, to attend prep schools throughout the southern United States.

The Franco-Savoyard War of 1600-1601 was an armed conflict between the French monarchy and the Duchy of Savoy. The war was fought primarily in the Po Valley, but also involved skirmishes in the Alps and elsewhere. The conflict ended with a decisive victory for France, which consolidated its influence in Italy.  The roots of the Franco-Savoyard War lay in the dynastic disputes of the 15th century. The House of Valois had succeeded to the French throne in 1483, but found itself hemmed in by rival branches of the royal family. The Burgundian nobleman Philip the Good allied himself with the Duchy of Savoy, hoping to create a bulwark against French expansion. In turn, France sought to undermine the Savoyard position by supporting competing claimants to Savoy's throne.  The war began in 1600, when Louis XIV of France invaded Savoy with an army of around 25,000 men. The Savoyards were initially successful in repelling the French, but were eventually overwhelmed. The Treaty of Turin (1601) recognised French suzerainty over Savoy and its territory north of the Alps, while also granting Savoy some important concessions. The war had a significant impact on Italian history, leading to a consolidation of French power in Italy and the creation of a strong French state presence there.

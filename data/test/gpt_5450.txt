The Cray X1 is a non-uniform memory storage system designed by Cray Inc. and announced on December 2, 2004. The system is based on the Cray XMP design, which uses a novel architecture that integrates memory with processors on a single chip.  The Cray X1 was designed as a high-performance storage system for scientific and engineering applications. It can handle large data sets and is designed to be a cost-effective alternative to more expensive systems. The Cray X1 has two modes of operation: scatter/gather and unified memory. scatter/gather mode allows the system to read data from multiple memory devices simultaneously, while unified memory mode allows the system to access data from a single memory device.

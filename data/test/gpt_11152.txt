The Abaco Independence Movement (AIM) was a political movement in the Abaco Islands of the Bahamas which sought independence from the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1968 by Noel Lewis and others, and had a brief period of success in the early 1970s. The movement faded away after its leaders were imprisoned or exiled, and Abaco eventually became part of the United States Virgin Islands.  The Abaco Islands were first settled by the Lucayan Indians in the early 16th century. The British became interested in the islands in the late 18th century, and began to develop them as a sugarcane plantation colony. In 1874, the islands were ceded to the British Crown as part of the Treaty of Washington which ended the US-British War of 1812. The islands remained part of the British Empire until they were granted independence as a Commonwealth realm in 1962.  The Abaco Independence Movement was founded in 1968 by Noel Lewis and others, shortly after Bahamian independence from Britain was granted. The movement began to gain traction in the early 1970s, when it began to draw support from Bahamian nationalists who opposed British control over the islands. AIM leaders declared an independent Republic of Abaco in July 1972, but this was short-lived; Lewis and other leaders were arrested or exiled, and Abaco soon became part of the United States Virgin Islands. The movement faded away after its leaders were imprisoned or exiled, and Abaco eventually became part of the United States Virgin Islands

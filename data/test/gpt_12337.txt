Janet McKenzie Hill (1852â€“1933) was a prominent early 20th century American suffragist and social worker. She is best known for her work as the superintendent of the Children's Aid Society of New York City from 1901 to 1925.  Born in 1852 in Concord, New Hampshire, Janet McKenzie Hill grew up in a family of nine children. After completing her undergraduate studies at Mount Holyoke College, Hill moved to New York City to study social work at the New York School of Social Work. In 1878, she became the superintendent of the Children's Aid Society of New York City, a position she held for more than 25 years. During her tenure, Hill worked to improve the conditions of children living in poverty in New York City. She also helped to develop the Children's Aid Society into one of the largest child welfare agencies in the United States.  After retiring from her position with the Children's Aid Society, Hill continued to work on social welfare issues. She served as the national president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Women (NAACP) from 1912 to 1913 and as the president of the Board of Lady Managers for National Baseball Park from 1916 to 1918. Hill died in 1933 at the age of 85 years old.

Fencehouses railway station served the village of Fencehouses, Tyne and Wear, England from 1841 to 1964 on the Leamside line. History  The station was opened in August 1841 by the Durham Junction Railway. It was situated near the north of the level crossing on Station Avenue. Goods sidings were behind the down platform, while more sidings were behind the up platform, branching off to a mineral depot. Adjacent to the station was also a goods shed with a track running through as well as cattle pens and a loading dock to the south. The goods handled at the station were tar and livestock. The station was initially a stop on the passenger service between  and Oakwellgate in Gateshead but on 19 June 1844, southbound services to were diverted to  and  along the newly constructed Newcastle & Darlington Junction Railway. Further extensions to this route ultimately led to creation of the Leamside line.

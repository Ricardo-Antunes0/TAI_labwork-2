He played a leading role in the successful campaign to have Canada's Constitution amended to include a guarantee of Aboriginal rights. Underwood has also been involved in campaigns to defend treaty rights and land claims, and to improve access to health care and education for Aboriginal people.  Underwood has also served as an advisor to several Canadian governments on Indigenous issues.

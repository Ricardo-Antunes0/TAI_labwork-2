The Threat Matrix is an intelligence-based measure of the potential impact of terrorist threats against global economies. It is maintained by the National Security Agency and was first published in February 2002.  The Threat Matrix is a publicly available database that aggregates information on terrorist threats to global economies. The Threat Matrix takes into account a variety of factors, including the level of terrorist activity, the type of terrorist threat, and the economic consequences of that threat.  The Threat Matrix is used by government officials and other experts to assess the level of threat posed by terrorist activity and to make decisions about how to respond. The Threat Matrix has been credited with helping to improve global counterterrorism efforts.

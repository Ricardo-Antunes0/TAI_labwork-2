Feradach Finnfechtnach (modern spelling: Fearadhach Fionnfeachtnach - "descendant of Finnfeachtnach") was an Irish-language poet and scholar of the late medieval period.  Feradach Finnfechtnach was born in the late 12th century, probably in the County Monaghan town of Clonmacnoise. He is best known for his poetry and scholarship in Irish, which he is thought to have begun studying in his early teens. He is also known for his work as a scribe, and is thought to have been a member of the royal court of Ireland.  Feradach Finnfechtnach died in the early 13th century. His works include poems and scholarly texts on both Irish and Latin poetry, as well as commentaries on Irish literature. He is considered one of the most important early Irish poets, and has been described as "the father of modern Irish poetry".

The Vučedol culture ( / Вучедолска култура) is an archaeological culture that existed in the Vučedol valley in southeastern Serbia and northwestern Bulgaria from the late Neolithic to the late Bronze Age. The name is derived from a local toponym, Vučedol, which means "winding valley".  The Vučedol culture was first identified by Ivan Duridanov in the early 20th century and later studied by Nikola Čačak and Dušan Džordžević. It is one of the most significant archaeological cultures of southeastern Europe, and is characterised by its V-shaped pottery vessels, stone tools, and burial rites. The culture is known from a number of sites, including Vučedol, Kostenik, Nebetovo Brdo, and Glavinica.

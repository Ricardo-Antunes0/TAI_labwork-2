Nicholas Frederick Chilton is an Australian chemist and a Professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Manchester. His research is in the areas of magnetochemistry and computational chemistry, and includes the design of high-temperature single molecule magnets, molecular spin qubits for quantum information science, methods and tools for modelling magnetic calculations. Education  Chilton completed his Advanced Bachelor of Science (Honors) degree at Monash University in 2011 where he finished his final year project with Stuart R. Batten and Keith S. Murray. His research at Monash included the synthesis and characterization of low-symmetry dysprosium complexes, and mixed-metallic lanthanide-transition metal clusters, that display single molecule magnetism. During this time, he also designed a software program, PHI, for the calculation of the magnetic properties of paramagnetic coordination complexes. Chilton completed his Ph.D. on magnetochemistry at the University of Manchester, supervised by Richard Winpenny and Eric McInnes in 2015. In 2021, he was promoted to Professor in Computational and theoretical chemistry.

Paulinella is a genus of about nine species of freshwater amoeboids. Its most famous members are the three photosynthetic species P. chromatophora, P. micropora and P. longichromatophora, the first two being freshwater forms and the third a marine form, which have recently (in evolutionary terms) taken on a cyanobacterium as an endosymbiont. As a result they are no longer able to perform phagocytosis like their non-photosynthetic relatives. The event to permanent endosymbiosis probably occurred with a cyanobiont. The resulting organelle is a photosynthetic plastid that is often referred to as a 'cyanelle' or chromatophore, and is the only other known primary endosymbiosis event of photosynthetic cyanobacteria, although primary endosymbiosis with a non-photosynthetic cyanobacterial symbiont have occurred in the diatom family Rhopalodiaceae. The endosymbiotic event happened about 90â€“140 million years ago in a cyanobacterial species which diverged about 500 million years ago from the ancestors of its sister clade that consist of the living members of the Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus cyanobacteria genera, which is a different clade to the plastids belonging to the Archaeplastida.

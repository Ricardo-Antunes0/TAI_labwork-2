The Chamber of Senators of Uruguay (CÃ¡mara de Senadores de Uruguay), or Senate, is the upper house of the General Assembly of Uruguay (Asamblea General de Uruguay). It has 30 members, elected for a five-year term by proportional representation; the Vice-president presides over the chamber's sessions. The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article Ninety-eight of the Uruguayan Constitution. It also requires that the senators must be at least 30 years old and have been Uruguayan citizens for seven years. In addition to the functions that it performs jointly with the House of Representatives through the General Assembly, it stands out as a competence that falls solely on the House of Senators to open a public trial to those accused by the House of Representatives or the Junta Departamental, in their case, and pronounce sentence for the sole purpose of separating them from their positions, by two-thirds of the total number of its components.

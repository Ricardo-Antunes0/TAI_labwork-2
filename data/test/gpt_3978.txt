The trap–bath split (also – split) is a physiological phenomenon in which a mammal's body temperature drops below the normal body temperature range, causing a state of hypothermia.  The trap–bath split is a physiological phenomenon in which a mammal's body temperature drops below the normal body temperature range, causing a state of hypothermia. The condition is most common in mammals, but can also occur in reptiles and amphibians. It results when the core body temperature falls below 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and can be fatal if not treated quickly.

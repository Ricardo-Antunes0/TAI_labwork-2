Rosa 'Honor',  (aka JAColite ), is a hybrid cultivar of the rose family, native to central and southern Europe.  Rosa 'Honor' is a cross between the hybrid Rosa 'Morgante' and the old-fashioned rose Rosa gallica. The result is a vigorous, upright shrub with large, double, pink flowers borne in clusters at the ends of long stems from early to midsummer. The flowers are fragrant, with a sweet and fruity fragrance. They are often used in arrangements or as cut flowers.  Rosa 'Honor' is hardy in U.S. Department of Agriculture zones 4 through 9, and can be grown as a shrub or small tree. It should be kept well pruned to keep it compact and free from high branches that can damage the flowers.

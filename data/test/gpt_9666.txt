Three 19th-century ships of the Royal Navy, the HMS Java, HMS Pearl and HMS Mercury, served as flagships for the British East India Company. Between 1846 and 1849 they each visited every major port in the British Empire, an unprecedented feat of naval diplomacy.   The HMS Java was designed by Sir Charles Napier and built in 1846 at a cost of £182,000. She was an iron-hulled screw ship of the line with a main armament of 98 guns. Her first voyage was to China and she returned to Britain in 1849. The HMS Pearl was also designed by Sir Charles Napier and built in 1846 at a cost of £183,000. She was an iron-hulled screw ship of the line with a main armament of 98 guns. Her first voyage was to China and she returned to Britain in 1849. The HMS Mercury was also designed by Sir Charles Napier and built in 1848 at a cost of £183,000. She was an iron-hulled screw ship of the line with a main armament of 96 guns. Her first voyage was to China and she returned to Britain in 1850.

Clyde Norman Wilson (born 11 June 1941) is an American professor of history at the University of South Carolina, a paleoconservative political commentator, a long-time contributing editor for  Chronicles: A Magazine of American Culture and Southern Partisan magazine, and an occasional contributor to National Review. He is best known for his controversial beliefs and writings which claim that women are subordinate to their husbands; American slavery was generally a public good; and opposition to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 guaranteeing African Americans and minorities the right to vote. Professor Wilson is also known for his expertise on the life and writings of John C. Calhoun, having recently compiled all his papers in twenty-eight volumes. He has been the M.E. Bradford Distinguished Chair of the Abbeville Institute, an adjunct faculty member of the paleolibertarian Ludwig von Mises Institute, and an affiliated scholar of the League of the South Institute, the research arm of the  League of the South. In 1994 Wilson was an original founder of the League of the South, which advocates a "natural societal order of superiors and subordinates", using as an example, "Christ is the head of His Church; husbands are the heads of their families; parents are placed over their children; employers rank above their employees; the teacher is superior to his students, etc." The League of the South has been described as a white supremacist and white nationalist organization.

Cibeles Palace (Spanish: Palacio de Cibeles), formally the Royal Palace of Madrid, is a large palace in the city of Madrid, capital of Spain. It is located in a large park at the foot of the Prado Museum, north of the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso and west of the Buen Retiro Park.  The palace was built between 1875 and 1885 as the private residence of Ferdinand VII, who moved there from the Palacio de La Granja de San Ildefonso. It was originally designed by Antonio Palacios, with the assistance of Fernando Álvarez Quirós and Eduardo Torroella. The palace was inaugurated on 15 October 1885. It was used as a royal residence until 1931, when it was given to the Spanish Academy of Fine Arts. In 1977 it became a museum.  The palace consists of three main parts: an entrance hall, an inner courtyard, and an outer courtyard. The entrance hall is decorated with marble reliefs representing allegorical figures from Spanish history and art. The inner courtyard has a small garden and a fountain with a statue of Neptune. The outer courtyard has a large terrace and is surrounded by a balustrade with statues of Cupid, Mercury, Diana, Mars, Minerva and Venus.

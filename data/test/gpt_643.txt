R Monocerotis, abbreviated R Mon, is a variable star in the constellation Monoceros. It is an A-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of A7V. The effective temperature of the star is about 6,000 K, giving it the characteristic yellow hue of an A-type star.  R Monocerotis is a relatively young star, having been formed about 100 million years ago. It is currently estimated to be around 10 million years old. As such, it is relatively bright for its age and is one of the most widely studied variable stars.  R Monocerotis is notably variably bright, with a range in brightness that can exceed 20%. This variability is thought to be caused by the magnetic fields of two orbiting companion stars. The brightness of R Monocerotis is also affected by a third companion star, which has a marginally cooler atmosphere and causes the star to periodically vary in brightness by around 0.2%

MII is a professional analog recording videocassette format developed by Panasonic in 1986 in competition with Sony's Betacam SP format.  It was technically similar to Betacam SP, using metal-formulated tape loaded in the cassette, and utilizing component video recording. MII is sometimes incorrectly referred to as M2; the official name uses Roman numerals, and is pronounced "em two".  Just as Betacam SP was an improved version of its predecessor Betacam (originally derived from Betamax) with higher video and audio quality, MII was an enhanced development of its predecessor, the failed M format (originally derived from VHS). There were two sizes of MII tape, the larger of which is close to VHS size and has a running time of up to around 90 minutes, the smaller tape was about half the size and runs up to around 20 minutes, and was also the size in which head cleaner tapes were supplied.

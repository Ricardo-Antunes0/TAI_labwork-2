Mike ( â€“ January 1929) was a British domestic shorthair cat. He was the first officially recognised British cat and is considered the father of modern British cat breeding.  Mike was born in January 1929 in London, England and was the first officially recognised British cat. His owner, Margery Fish, noticed that he had a unusually long tail and took him to the veterinarian to have it measured. The veterinarian concluded that Mike's tail was too long for a domestic cat and declared him a "museum piece". Fish kept Mike as a pet and began breeding him to create the first British pedigree cats.  Mike has been credited with helping to create modern British cat breeding, as he helped to establish the British Shorthair as a recognized breed. He died in January 1929 in London, England.

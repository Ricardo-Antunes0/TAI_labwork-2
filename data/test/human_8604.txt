Canthigaster amboinensis, commonly known as Ambon pufferfish or Ambon toby, is a species of pufferfish of the family Tetraodontidae. The species is common, and native, to the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean, including Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan and the Hawaiian Islands. The species is named after the island of Ambon in Indonesia. Description  The Ambon toby are overall chunky and rotund, but are fast swimmers and often hard to approach. They can reach a length of 5 in. They can be identified by its dark brown base color, blue-green lines radiating from the eyes, dark blue spots and lines on the cheeks, and iridescent light blue to white spots on head and body, which are absent from the anus to its lower jaw. Among 30 species within the genus of Canthigaster, C. amboinensis is rarely included in research studies and can be difficult to differentiate from two other species.

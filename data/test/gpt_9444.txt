HMS LST 3519 was a Landing Ship, Tank (LST) of the British Royal Navy. She was built in 1944 by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company Ltd, Glasgow. She was commissioned into service in 1945.  After World War II, the Royal Navy required a large number of Landing Ship, Tank (LST)s to transport troops and supplies across the world. LST 3519 was one of these vessels and saw service in various conflicts around the world, including the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency. In 1959, she was decommissioned and sold to the Portuguese Navy. She served in that country until she was scrapped in 1981.

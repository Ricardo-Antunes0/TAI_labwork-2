Plaza Mexico is a historic riverside square in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. The square is bounded by Padre Burgos Street to the north, Quirino Avenue to the east, Taft Avenue to the south and General Luna Street to the west.     The plaza was originally a part of a Spanish colonial villa, which was later donated to the Catholic Church in 1786. It served as the main square of Manila until 1898, when it was replaced by Luneta Park. In 1935, a fountain was erected in the center of the plaza to commemorate the Philippine Independence Day.     The plaza has been used for a number of historic events, including protests and executions. Today, it is home to a number of restaurants and shops, as well as a statue of Jos√© Rizal.

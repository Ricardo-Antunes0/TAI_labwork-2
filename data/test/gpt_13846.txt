The Genevan Consistory  is a council of the Catholic Church that was founded in 1560 by the Protestant Reformation. The Genevan Consistory is the highest court of appeal for Swiss Catholics.  The Genevan Consistory was founded by the Protestant Reformation, which divided the Catholic Church in Switzerland into two parts. The Reformed part, led by Calvin, separated from the Catholic Church in 1559. The Catholic part, which was led by Peter Martyr Vermigli and Ignaz Zuber, tried to keep together. However, in 1560, they created the Genevan Consistory as a supreme court of appeal for Swiss Catholics. The Genevan Consistory was modeled after the ecclesiastical courts of Germany and Italy.   The first president of the Genevan Consistory was Hieronymus Bosch. It has been headed by Rudolf Suessens since 1968. The current president is Alain Berset.

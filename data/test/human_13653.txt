The 1993 Royal Rumble was the sixth annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on January 24, 1993, at the ARCO Arena in Sacramento, California. It centered on the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. Six matches were contested at the event, including one dark match. The main event was the 1993 Royal Rumble match. It was won by Yokozuna, who was awarded a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania IX. This was the first time that the Rumble winner earned a world championship match at WrestleMania, which is now standard for the annual event. In other prominent matches, Bret Hart defeated Razor Ramon to retain the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, and Shawn Michaels defeated Marty Jannetty to retain the WWF Intercontinental Championship.

"Remember a Day" is a song by the British rock band Pink Floyd, written and sung by their keyboardist Richard Wright, appearing on their second album, A Saucerful of Secrets (1968). It was performed by Pink Floyd only once, as an encore in May 1968; it was subsequently performed by David Gilmour in September 2008 in memory of Wright, who had recently died of cancer, on Later... with Jools Holland,  and by Nick Mason during his Saucerful of Secrets tour. The dreamy, poetic lyrics are about nostalgia for the lost paradise of early childhood. Recording The song, written and sung by Wright, was recorded during two different sessions. During the first session (May 1967), Wright's vocals, piano, and Farfisa organ were recorded and during the second session (October 1967) Syd Barrett's acoustic and slide guitar as well as the bass and drum sections were recorded at De Lane Lea Studios in London. The sessions also produced "Jugband Blues".

Earl James "Joaquin" Murphey (often spelled "Murphy", December 14, 1912 â€“ October 25, 1984) was an American musician and songwriter, noted for his work in country music.  Murphey was born in Livingston, Texas, to a family of Scottish and Irish immigrants. He learned to play the fiddle from his father, who also taught him to play the guitar. At age 14 he began touring with his father's band as a singer and guitarist. Murphey served in the United States Marine Corps during World War II, playing guitar in military bands in the Pacific theater.  After the war, Murphey settled in Nashville, Tennessee and began a successful career as a country singer. He wrote or co-wrote many of his best-known songs, including "Lady" (1949), "I Can't Quit You Baby" (1956), "The Day I Met You" (1957), and "Help Me Make It Through The Night" (1970). Murphey also recorded duets with such singers as Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn, and had several charted singles as a solo artist. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1980.  Murphey died of a heart attack at the age of 71. His death marked the end of an era in country music; he had been one of its most popular performers for more than four decades.

Syringa Park is a provincial park on the east shore of Lower Arrow Lake in the West Kootenay region of southeastern British Columbia. At the foot of the Norns Range, Tulip Creek passes through the centre, and Syringa Creek is closer to the southeastern boundary. The park is about  west of Castlegar via Broadwater Rd. Name origin In 1903, David Loughnan and Robert Russell Rose spent several months camped by Syringa Creek, which they named on observing the preponderance of syringa. The men had been hired by a British aristocrat to log the land, but could not receive mail to their camp unless the place was given an official name. The following year, the Geographic Board of Canada officially adopted the name. The mock-orange syringa, indigenous to the area, blooms in the early spring, releasing a distinct scent. The area has cultural and spiritual significance to the Okanagan, Shuswap and Ktunaxa-kinbasket First Nations. A European community soon developed on what was the Columbia River foreshore. Residents relocated prior to the reservoir for the Keenleyside Dam submerging the area in 1968.

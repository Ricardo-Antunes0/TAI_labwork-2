Energy Management Software (EMS) is a general term for a variety of software applications and systems that help organizations manage their energy resources more effectively. EMS can encompass everything from simple command-line tools to sophisticated, enterprise-level software suites.  EMS can be used to improve energy productivity by automating routine tasks, helping users to identify and analyze energy data, and providing insights into how best to use resources. They can also help to reduce costs by improving efficiency and alerting users when prices are about to change.

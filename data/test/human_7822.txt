George Ward (born 30 November 1993), better known by the stage name Cherry Valentine, is a British drag queen and nurse from Darlington, England. She is best known for competing on the second series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK, where she came twelfth on the series. Career Valentine has performed as a drag queen since 2018. She had been qualified as a mental health nurse since 2015, and still currently work as part of the NHS, and is currently helping with the UK's COVID-19 vaccine rollout. In December 2020, Valentine was announced as one of twelve contestants competing on the second series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK. She stated in her Meet The Queens video interview for the second series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK, that working as a nurse "has put me in that right position where I'm able to understand people a bit more, and if you're a drag queen, you're working with people. By understanding people, you're going the extra mile". Valentine placed 12th overall in the competition after she placed in the bottom in episode two, and was eliminated in a lip sync challenge against contestant Tayce to the song "Memory" by Elaine Paige from the 1981 Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Cats. In February 2022, Valentine will embark on RuPaul's Drag Race UK: The Official Tour alongside the entire cast of the second series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK, in association with World of Wonder and promoter Voss Events.

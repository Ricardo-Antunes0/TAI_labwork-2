The yellow-spotted rock hyrax or bush hyrax (Chiropotes flavicollis) is a hyrax species from the genus Chiropotes. It is found in central Africa from Mauritania to Zimbabwe. It was formerly included with the grey-striped rock hyrax, but is now considered a separate species.  The yellow-spotted rock hyrax is the smallest of the three bush hyrax species and has a stocky build with short, slightly curved ears and a short tail. The fur is light brown on its back, becoming darker around its neck, shoulders, and chest. The underside of the animal is lighter in colour, with a yellow patch on each side of its stomach. The yellow-spotted rock hyrax has a lifespan of around 15 years in the wild and up to 20 years in captivity.  The yellow-spotted rock hyrax mainly eats plants, but it will also eat small animals if they are available. It lives in groups of up to 12 animals and defends its territory by vocalizing and scratching at the ground.

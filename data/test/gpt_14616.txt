Ernst Krebs (4 November 1906 â€“ 20 February 1984) was a German chemist who did groundbreaking work on the chemical basis of metabolism. He is also known for his contributions to quantum chemistry and the development of quantum electrodynamics.  Ernst Krebs was born in 1906 in Danzig, then part of Germany. After completing his undergraduate studies at the University of Freiburg, he received his doctorate from the University of Berlin in 1928 with a thesis on the chemical basis of metabolism. He then worked at the University of Berlin as a research associate until 1933, when he was forced to leave Germany due to his Jewish heritage.  Krebs spent the next three years working at the University of Cambridge, where he developed quantum electrodynamics. He returned to Berlin in 1939, where he continued his work on metabolism until his retirement in 1972. He died in 1984.  Ernst Krebs is considered one of the most important chemists of the 20th century, and his work has had a significant impact on both molecular biology and quantum chemistry. His discoveries have helped us to understand how our bodies function and how diseases can be caused.

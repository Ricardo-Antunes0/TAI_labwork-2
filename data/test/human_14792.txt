Mell Kilpatrick (1902–1962) was an American photographer, recognized mostly for his work for the Santa Ana Register, known today as the Orange County Register. While working as the chief photographer for the Santa Ana Register, Kilpatrick took thousands of photographs of car crash scenes and police work around the Orange County area in California. He was also one of the few photographers allowed into Disneyland during its construction in 1954–55. The first images of Disneyland were developed in Kilpatrick's tiny Santa Ana darkroom in 1954 and 1955. He continued taking photographs of Disneyland through the early 1960s until close to his death in 1962. Biography  Kilpatrick originally moved to Southern California to work as a musician. His first job was at the Dianna Ballroom where he played the cornet. His music career was cut short in 1947 when he developed periodontal disease. Turning to work as a projectionist, Kilpatrick found a strong interest in the field of photography. He initially took photos of car crashes for insurance companies. His work eventually caught the eye of the Santa Ana Register.

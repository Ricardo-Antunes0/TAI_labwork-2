A flitch beam (or flitched beam) is a timber frame construction technique where the beam is not a single piece of timber but is made up of several pieces, or flitches, joined together.  The flitch beam construction technique was first used in medieval England and was popularised by the Tudor and Stuart monarchs who required a strong and reliable timber frame for their many Palace buildings. The flitch beam construction technique is still in use today, particularly in Europe and North America, for example in the construction of bridges and houses.

In auctions, the buyer's premium is a charge in addition to the hammer price (i.e. the winning bid announced) of an auction item, or lot. The winning bidder is required to pay both the hammer price and the percentage of that price called for by the buyer's premium. It is charged by the auctioneer in addition to the seller's commission, which had always been charged by auction houses to consignors. One hundred per cent of the "buyer's premium" is retained by the auction house and is not shared with the item's consignor. Major auction houses have levied the buyer's premium for several decades, particularly in fine art auctions, with percentages in the region of 10–30%.  In real estate auctions in many European countries, the buyer's premium, if charged at all, is much less (2–2.5%). More recently in the UK, however, foreclosure properties have been offered without fee to the consignor, but with a buyer's premium of 10%.

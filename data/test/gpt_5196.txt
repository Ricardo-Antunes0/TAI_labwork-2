The Milford Congregational Church is a historic church in Milford, Connecticut. Built in 1812, it is one of the oldest Congregational churches in the state. It is also one of the state's earliest brick churches. The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.  The Milford Congregational Church is located on the north side of town, on the east side of Main Street just south of its junction with Church Street. It is a large three-story brick building, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is three bays wide, with a central entrance in a gabled portico, flanked by two flanking pilasters and topped by a pediment. The doorway is framed by round-arch panels, and has elaborate carved trim. The interior features a high ceiling and marble wall and flooring.  The church was built in 1812 by members of the congregation who had previously worshiped in a 1792 log meeting house. It was formally dedicated on June 15 of that year, and served as the main church for the town until 1887, when it was replaced by a larger facility. The church has been used for other purposes since then, most recently as a community center. It remains active today, serving as a polling place and meeting place for civic groups.

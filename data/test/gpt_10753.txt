13q deletion syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that results from the deletion of 13q in the human genome. Affected individuals have a significantly increased incidence of certain mental disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism.  The deletion of 13q is a rare event and is estimated to occur in 1 in every 1,000 births. The syndrome is most commonly found in people of European descent, but it has also been reported in people from other parts of the world. 13q deletion syndrome is typically diagnosed during childhood or early adolescence, but it can also be diagnosed later in life.  Affected individuals typically have a variety of mental disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism. These disorders are typically more severe and frequent in individuals who have 13q deletion syndrome than in individuals who do not have the syndrome.  13q deletion syndrome is currently the only known cause of the disorder known as Rett syndrome. Rett syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that results from the deletion of a portion of the brain called the Rett Syndrome Critical Region (RSCR).  13q deletion syndrome is still being studied and its causes are unknown. However, scientists are working to find ways to treat and prevent the associated mental disorders.

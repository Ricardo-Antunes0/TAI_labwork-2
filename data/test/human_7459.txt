United States non-interventionism primarily refers to the foreign policy eventually applied by the United States between the late 18th and the first half of the 20th centuries whereby it sought to avoid alliances with other nations to prevent being drawn into wars not related to direct territorial self-defense. Neutrality and non-interventionism found support among elite and popular opinion in the United States which varied depending on the international context and the country's interests. At times, the degree and nature of this policy was better known as isolationism, such as the period between the world wars. Due to the Cold-War subsequent to the Second World War's end, and the rise of the United States as global super power, its traditional foreign policy turned into a diplomatic and military interventionism, engaging or somehow intervening in virtually any overseas armed conflict ever since; and concluding multiple bilateral and regional military alliances, chiefly the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). A non-interventionist policy has continued to be claimed by some American figures and people since the mid 20th century, mostly regarding specific armed conflicts like the Vietnam and Korean wars or the more recent Syrian Civil War.

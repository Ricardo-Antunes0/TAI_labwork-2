Titch is a British stop-motion children's television programme that originally aired on Children's ITV from 1997 to 2001, then from 2001 to 1 January 2006 on Tiny Living, before appearing on Milkshake! in 2004 as Tiny Living went off-air. It was created by Pat Hutchins, also the creator of the Titch book series. Production According to Pat Hutchins, each episode took three weeks to shoot as it was created in stop-motion animation, using clay models instead of proposed cartoons. The models were miniatures, as ITV gave the animating team a limited budget so that production or scale was minimalistic. After the first two series finished airing in 1999, a third series went into production, and premiered during 2000, before it had its final episode in mid-2001. There is no disclosed reason why the programme was cancelled, but repeats of the programme aired occasionally until around 2003. The series was then repeated on Tiny Living before moving to Milkshake! on Channel 5 between 2005 and 2006.

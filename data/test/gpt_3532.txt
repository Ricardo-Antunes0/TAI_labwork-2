Thomas Madiou (Port-au-Prince, April 30 1815-ibidem, May 21 1892) was a Haitian sculptor.  Born into a poor peasant family in Port-au-Prince, Madiou showed an early interest in art and began to learn sculpting from his father. In 1837 he moved to France to further his studies and worked as a sculptor in various workshops before eventually settling in Paris. He is most famous for his busts of Napoléon III and Émile Zola, both of which are now on display in the Musée du Louvre.

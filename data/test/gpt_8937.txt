Fyodor Petrovich Korol (; 23 November 1894 – 5 March 1976) was a Soviet Russian painter and graphic artist. Korol was one of the most famous representatives of the Leningrad School of Painting, which flourished in the 1930s and 1940s.  Korol was born in the town of Vitebsk in what was then Russian Empire into a family of artists. After studying at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture (1914–1917), he moved to Leningrad and became a student of Vasily Perov and Sergei Prokofiev at the Leningrad Academy of Art (1917–1920). He also studied privately with Konstantin Sommer and Lev Trotskii. Korol worked as a graphic artist for a number of newspapers before being accepted into the Union of Soviet Artists in 1932.  Korol's early work focused on figure painting, but he soon developed an interest in abstraction. In 1942, he exhibited his first purely abstract paintings at the second Leningrad exhibition of contemporary art. Over the course of his career, Korol produced a large body of abstract work, which is often considered his finest work. He is also known for his portraits, landscape paintings, and still lifes. Korol died in 1976 at the age of 79.

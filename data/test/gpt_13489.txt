White Brazilians  refers to Brazilian citizens who are not of African descent. The term is used in contrast to the Afro-Brazilian population, who are descendants of enslaved Africans. The majority of Brazilians who identify as white are of Portuguese and Spanish descent.  The Portuguese discovered Brazil in 1500 and the Spanish arrived in 1519. For centuries the Portuguese and the Spanish had a privileged relationship, with each nation controlling different parts of the country. The Dutch occupied Brazil in 1624 and the British in 1807. The country became a republic in 1889.  Brazil's demographics changed dramatically after World War II. The war led to an influx of European refugees, who made up about a third of Brazil's population by 1950. This influx was especially significant in the southern states, which had been largely untouched by the war. As a result, whites became a minority in many of Brazil's major cities.  Since then, white Brazilians have maintained a strong presence in Brazilian society. They have played an important role in many aspects of Brazilian culture, including literature, music, film, and cuisine.

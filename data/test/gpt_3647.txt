The Thorstein Veblen Farmstead is a National Historic Landmark in the town of Pierce, in Schoharie County, New York. It is one of the largest and most important surviving pre-Revolutionary-era farmsteads in upstate New York.  The Thorstein Veblen Farmstead is located on a hilltop east of Pierce, in the town of Schoharie. It consists of a main block, a 1-1/2 story main dwelling, and a barn. The main block is three bays wide, with a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The main entrance is in the center bay, and there are two smaller side entrances. The dwelling is two stories high, with a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. It has an unusually large chimney for an 18th-century house, and it has two front chimneys. The barn is three bays wide, with a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. It has an unusual feature: its end walls are notched instead of being straight, apparently to allow it to be used as a hay loft.

It is one of the largest and most important surviving pre-Revolutionary-era farmsteads in upstate New York.

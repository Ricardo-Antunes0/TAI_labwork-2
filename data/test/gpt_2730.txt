The Kensington Renewal Initiative (KRI) is a British charity that was formed in 2007 to help regenerate areas of the Kensington district of London. The charity has raised over £10 million to date, and has invested this money into schemes such as regeneration of derelict buildings, construction of new housing, and street improvements.  The Kensington Renewal Initiative was founded in 2007 by a group of businessmen, including the then-chairman of the Council of British Columbia, Denis Toone. The initiative was initially conceived as a way to help regenerate areas of the Kensington district of London following the 2006 London bombings. The charity has since raised over £10 million to date, and has invested this money into schemes such as regeneration of derelict buildings, construction of new housing, and street improvements. In addition to these traditional charitable activities, the KRI has also undertaken a number of initiatives specific to Kensington, such as the redevelopment of the Royal Albert Hall and the restoration of Battersea Power Station.

The Cardiff power stations supplied electricity to the City of Cardiff and the surrounding area from 1894 to about 1970. The original power station was in Riverside; a larger replacement station was built in Roath in the 1902, initially to supply the tramway system. They were both owned and operated by Cardiff Corporation prior to the nationalisation of the British electricity supply industry in 1948. The Roath power station was redeveloped in the 1920s and 1940s to meet the increased demand for electricity. History In 1891 Cardiff Corporation applied for a Provisional Order under the Electric Lighting Acts to generate and supply electricity to the city. This was granted by the Board of Trade and was confirmed by Parliament through the Electric Lighting Orders Confirmation (No. 8) Act 1891 (54 & 55 Vict. c. civ). The original power station was built on Eldon Road, Riverside (at ) and it first supplied electricity in 1894. Further equipment was added to meet the rising demand for electricity; by the 1920s it had a generating capacity of 900 kW.

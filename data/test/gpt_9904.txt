Rhodochrosite is a manganese carbonate mineral with the formula MnCO3. It is usually red, but can also be green or purple.  Rhodochrosite is a ubiquitous mineral found in a variety of settings, most notably in coal seams and other sedimentary rocks. It is also a major component of the iron ore deposits of the Lake Superior region of North America. The color of rhodochrosite is due to the presence of manganese and carbon atoms. Manganese atoms give the mineral its characteristic red color, while the carbon atoms make it green or purple.  Rhodochrosite is a very hard mineral and has a Mohs hardness of 6.5 to 7. Rhodochrosite can be cut with a knife but will often break into small pieces.

The Holden Monaro 427C was an Australian-made, two-seat sports car that was produced by Holden from 1978 to 1981.  The Monaro 427C was powered by a 4.2-litre V8 engine that produced 375 PS (295 kW; 375 hp). The car was capable of reaching speeds of up to 270 km/h (170 mph), making it one of the fastest production cars available at the time.  The Monaro 427C was discontinued in 1981, but has since been re-introduced as a collectors' item.

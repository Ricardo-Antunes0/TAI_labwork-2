Westpoint Exeter (formerly Westpoint Arena) is a multi-purpose indoor arena and showground, at Clyst St Mary, near Exeter, England. The capacity of the venue is 7,500 people. It hosts local concerts, fairs and exhibitions. Westpoint is the largest exhibition and entertainment venue in the South West and is located near to Exeter Airport. Construction Westpoint's arena and showground was built on the former Ivington Farm to host the annual Devon County Show each May. The farm was purchased by the Devon County Agricultural Association, with work on the site estimated to have cost a further sum in excess of Â£3 million. 50,000 square feet of unobstructed floor space, and a building capable of seating 6,000 people opened in 1990. The 4,590 sq metre column-free main arena doubles as an exhibition area and, for the County Show, a cattle shed. Large car parks can accommodate well over 12,000 cars at any one time.

Gerspunken is a glam/metal band from Mayrhofen, Austria.  Formed in 2002, the band released their first album, Geworden Spunker! ('Get Spunked!') in 2005. Gerspunken's combination of classical instrumentals and themes into their tracks (The band's front-man and bassist Bruno Speltervasser and lead guitarist Hans Burstein met whilst studying at the Konservatorium Wien, Vienna's Conservatorium of Music, in 2001) is unique in the glam genre. This facet of their composition has attracted mixed criticism, as has their utilization of electronic music generation. Origins   The group's origins can be traced to the time Speltervasser and Burstein spent at the Konservatorium Wien in 2001. The duo were familiar with each other from their youth in the Tyrolean town of Mayrhofen, and had worked together for a short period at the Peter Habeler Mountaineering Academy during the summer of 2000. Burstein, born in Poland, moved to Austria when he was seven. The pair were accomplished young musicians at this point but played exclusively in the classical genre, Burstein as a flautist and Speltervasser playing Violin and Viola for the Tyrolean Youth Orchestra. Burstein took up a position at the Konservatorium in late 2000 at the suggestion of his parents, and Speltervasser joined his friend at the institution the following year.

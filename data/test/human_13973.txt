Early life The 1930s were depression years, and there was no money for books. Cowan's mother would make up stories to entertain her two daughters.  From age three until age nine, Cowan lived at Sacred Heart Orphanage and Boarding School on Sprague Street in Pueblo, Colorado, where she struggled with dyslexia, which prevented her from being able to read. As the nuns read to the class, she memorized  the stories she liked until she knew them by heart. These experiences gave her a lasting love of the art of storytelling.

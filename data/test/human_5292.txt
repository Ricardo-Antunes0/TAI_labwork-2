Marvin Sylvor (April 21, 1933 â€“ April 9, 2008) was an American carousel and merry-go-round designer and artist. Sylvor has designed more the sixty carousels worldwide including Bryant Park in New York City, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Singapore and other parts of the United States. Early life  Sylvor was raised in the Bronx and grew up on the corner of 165th Street and Jerome Avenue, which is located near Yankee Stadium. He and his father, a sign painter, would vacation in the Rockaways every year. Each year Sylvor would ask to ride a carousel which they would pass near Marine Park Bridge on the way to their vacation.  Sylvor's father, who he described as always in a hurry to get to their vacation destination, always refused to stop for the carousel ride. Sylvor later told the New York Times in a 2002 interview why his father never stopped, "He was a man on a mission to get to the Rockaways."

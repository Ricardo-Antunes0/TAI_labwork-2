My Brother is the biography of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, by his sister Fatima Jinnah. It is thought that the publication of Hector Bolitho's book, Jinnah Creator of Pakistan in 1954 prompted Miss Jinnah to write about her brother as it was felt that Bolitho's book had failed to bring out the political aspects of her brother's life. It was published by the Quaid-i-Azam Academy in 1987. A major focus of the book are his political aspirations and how his failing health affected them. The Daily Times summarized it as "...he was aware of the peril his failing health posed, thus wanted to do whatever he could to build the new country whose existence was precarious owing to lack of resources and enormous challenges on the economic and political fronts." It explores his feelings of betrayal in older age and sickness, for example, when picked by an ambulance when struggling to breathe, it ran out of gas, and then lay in wait for an hour for another to come.

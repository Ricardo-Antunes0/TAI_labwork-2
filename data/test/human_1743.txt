The song was written by Amy Macdonald, Matt Jones and produced by Jim Abbiss. It is her first top 20 hit in Scotland since 2012's "Slow It Down". Background In an interview with Wonderland, Macdonald talked about the stories her dad told her about New York in the 70s, "My dad has loads of stories and the stories of him and my mum travelling around the US when they were younger are amazing. He had been telling me about staying in a hotel in New York that had 3 bolts across the door. [...] It explores all the same themes of life and wondering if youâ€™ve made the right decisions and taken the right path but it feels like it means so much more to me because of everything that has happened through these years."

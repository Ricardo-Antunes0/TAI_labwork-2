Ecgfrith (;  ;  64520 May 692) was King of Northumbria from 654 until his death.  Ecgfrith was the son of Æthelberht, who had been king of Bernicia and Deira in northern England. He succeeded his brother Oswald in 654, and reigned for thirteen years. He was an able ruler, and restored order to Northumbria after the chaos of the civil war of 655–658. He was also successful on the battlefield, and conquered various territory in northern England and Scotland.  In 670 Ecgfrith led an expedition to Pictland, where he defeated the Picts at the Battle of Dunnichen Hill and forced them into submission. He died in 692, and was buried at Lindisfarne.

He quickly rose through the organization, becoming its second-in-command and head of its operations in the United States. In 2006, he was apprehended by Mexican authorities while trying to cross into Texas. He was extradited to Mexico and sentenced to 25 years in prison. In 2012, he escaped from a Mexican prison, but was recaptured and sent back to prison.  Guerrero died in a shootout with Mexican police on October 8, 2013. He was 50 years old.

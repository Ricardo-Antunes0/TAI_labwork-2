The ASEAN University Network (AUN) is an institutional network of universities in the ASEAN region. The AUN was founded in 2007 with the aim of promoting cooperation and sharing resources among its member universities. As of February 2017, there are ten member universities: Bangkok University, Cambodia University of Technology, Chulalongkorn University, Indonesian Institute of Sciences, La Trobe University, Mahidol University, National University of Singapore, Pantai Gading Institute and Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.  The AUN operates through a cooperative model in which each participating university has voting rights. The network's governing body is the AUN Council, which is made up of representatives from each member university. The AUN Council implements policy and decides on funding allocation proposals.

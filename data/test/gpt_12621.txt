Chancellor is an ecclesiastical title used by variously the Protestant and Roman Catholic Churches. The title is derived from the Latin word cancellarius meaning "chancer". In the Anglican Communion, the title is used by bishops of the highest rank within their provinces, who are also styled "The Right Reverend".  The Chancellor is responsible for the administration of a diocese or episcopal district. In Catholic churches, he or she also exercises pastoral care and may also be involved in teaching. He or she may be a member of the College of Bishops. In Protestant churches, the Chancellor is typically not ordained and often has no pastoral responsibilities. The office is often one of distinction, with many Chancellors holding important national or international positions.  The title has been in use from at least the 4th century AD, when it was given to a senior official in the administration of the church by St. Ambrose. The first known Chancellor of England was Richard de Bury, who held the office during the reign of Henry II.

Dr. Mukherjee has been involved in health care access and human rights issues since 1989, and she consults for the World Health Organization on the treatment of HIV and MDR-TB in developing countries.  Her scholarly work focuses on the human rights aspect of HIV treatment and on the implementation of complex health interventions in resource-poor settings. Personal life  Joia Mukherjee was raised in Huntington, New York. As the daughter of an Indian father and American mother, she found herself exposed to issues of global poverty and social injustice, at a young age.  In 1972, at the age of eight, she traveled to India where she found herself outraged by squalid conditions of poverty.  Mukherjee's passion to combat poverty and injustice continued throughout her early years and was fostered through action and academic pursuit.  Having served populations of the world's poorest and witnessed first-hand the global injustices that plague so many, Mukherjee finds much needed motivation and enjoyment in singing, cooking, and spending time with loved ones.

Conrad Ecklie is a fictional character on the television series CSI played by Marc Vann.  He was employed as Assistant Director of the crime lab of Clark County, Nevada, and dayshift counterpart of Gilbert Grissom, he eventually left the crime lab altogether and became Undersheriff in Season 9, then elected Sheriff of Clark County in Season 13. In earlier seasons, he is a typical antagonist of Grissom's team. As the series progresses, he gradually starts to become a good friend to the CSI team, at one point even showing remorse for his earlier behavior. Fictional character biography Ecklie is a former day shift supervisor, promoted to Assistant Director in season 5. He is known for his strict adherence to regulations, and takes on more of the role of a bureaucrat and politician. He also appears to be quite ambitious and career-minded and a vigorous self-promoter; thus, he has received praise from senior city and county officials on several occasions.  Ecklie and night shift supervisor Gil Grissom have a very rocky relationship throughout the series, with Grissom claiming Ecklie is more concerned with advancement than evidence, and Ecklie maintaining that Grissom shows favoritism toward his subordinates. Grissom's animosity toward Ecklie is shared by several other members of the night shift, including Sara Sidle, who was nearly fired for insubordination when she yelled at Ecklie ("The only reason this is your lab, is because Grissom doesn't kiss ass"). Catherine Willows, though not an admirer of Ecklie's, has criticized Grissom on several occasions because his indifference to office politics has allowed the more ambitious Ecklie to advance beyond him. In addition to earning him promotions, Ecklie's political skills have prompted favorable comparison over Grissom by superiors, some of whom feel Grissom is an occasionally inefficient investigator.  Part of Ecklie's distaste for Grissom seem to stem from his belief Grissom is as career-minded as he is. As such, Ecklie often assumes Grissom's requests for delays or equipment are attempts to sabotage him and does not appear to have qualms about retaliating, although this seems to have ended from season 6 onwards.

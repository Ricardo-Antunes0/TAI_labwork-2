Both the cover art and the music video were designed by Catalan illustrator Laia López. Background  In an interview with Los40 a year later, Mexican musical trio Reik told the radio station that they had a project in common with the Spanish singer. Four days later Aitana told to the same radio station that the collaboration was going to be released soon as well as another one with Colombian band Piso 21 that will be released throughout the year. On May 10, Aitana announced that she would go live on Instagram with someone the following day in the evening to reveal something special. See so, she contacted with Reik and shared the live-stream in order to announce their newest musical collaboration. Aitana told the audience that the song was recorded in April 2019 and meant to be included in the singer's debut album Spoiler but was somehow discarted in major part because she felt like there was something missing in the track. In order to fill the void, she contacted with Reik and got fascinated on how their voices adjoined.

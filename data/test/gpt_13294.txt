Shehr-e-Zaat (English: City of Existence) is a 1971 Hindi-language Indian drama film directed by Mehboob Khan. It stars Sanjeev Kumar, Waheeda Rehman, and Zia Sarhadi in the lead roles. The film was a blockbuster at the box office and is considered one of Mehboob Khan's most popular films.  The story is set in late-1870s India. The British Raj is firmly in place, and although some changes are taking place, life for the average Indian is largely unchanged. Outwardly, everything appears to be fine - but beneath the surface, there is unrest.  The film follows the lives of three generations of a family - the first of which is representatives of an era when things were much different. As the second generation matures and starts to question the values and norms that have been passed down to them, they find themselves at odds with society and government. Finally, in the third generation, things have changed so much that their parents' generation would barely recognise them - and yet, even here, there are hidden dangers that threaten their way of life.

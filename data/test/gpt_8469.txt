Maple Works, also called Mapleworks was a production facility and company in the town of West Bend, Wisconsin, United States.  Maple Works was founded in 1883 by George L. Maple and his brother-in-law, James F. Smith. The company manufactured a variety of wooden products including doors, window frames, and barns. The company became one of the largest wood products manufacturers in the United States and was well known for its maple products, which it marketed under the Maple Works name. The company was acquired by Koch Industries in 1980 and was later sold to a group of investors in 1994.  Maple Works played an important role in the history of West Bend. The company was responsible for creating many of the town's landmarks, including the Mapleworks Building (now the West Bend Public Library), the Mapleworks Manufacturing Company Office Building (now West Bend Senior High School), and the Mapleworks Dairy Barn (now a museum operated by the West Bend Historical Society). The company also helped to revitalize the town's economy during its heyday and was a major employer in the community for many years.  Today, Mapleworks is a museum operated by the West Bend Historical Society. The museum features exhibits about maple products, West Bend history, and Koch Industries history.

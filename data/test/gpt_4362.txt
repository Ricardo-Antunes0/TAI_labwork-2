The Siege of Weinsberg took place in the winter of 1689-1690, when the Protestant forces of the Elector Palatine, under the command of General Georg Ludwig von Wallenstein, captured the Catholic stronghold of Weinsberg.  The siege began on December 22, 1689, and lasted until May 25, 1690. Despite a courageous defense led by Count Philipp Christoph von Daun, Weinsberg was eventually captured by Wallenstein's forces. The event greatly tarnished Wallenstein's reputation and contributed to his downfall.

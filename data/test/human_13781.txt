Interferometry examines the general interference phenomena between pairs of signals in order to gain useful information about the subsurface. Seismic interferometry (SI) utilizes the crosscorrelation of signal pairs to reconstruct the impulse response of a given media. Papers by Keiiti Aki (1957), Géza Kunetz, and Jon Claerbout (1968) helped develop the technique for seismic applications and provided the framework upon which modern theory is based. A signal at a location A can be crosscorrelated with a signal at a location B to reproduce a virtual source-receiver pair using seismic interferometry. Crosscorrelation is often considered the key mathematical operation in this approach, but it is also possible to use convolution to come up with a similar result. The crosscorrelation of passive noise measured at a free surface reproduces the subsurface response as if it was induced by an impulsive point source, which is, by definition, equal to Green's function. As such, it is possible to obtain information about the subsurface with no need for an active seismic source. This method, however, is not limited to passive sources, and can be extended for use with active sources and computer–generated waveforms.

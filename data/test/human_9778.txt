Genesis Publications Limited is a British publishing company founded in 1974 by Brian Roylance, a former student of the London College of Printing. His aim was to create a company in the traditions of the private press, true to the arts of printing and book binding. Headed today by his son and daughter, Nick Roylance and Catherine Roylance (also a former student of the London College of Printing), Genesis Publications produces signed, limited edition books that are created in close collaboration with authors and artists. First known for specialising in historical volumes, Genesis is now known as an art house publisher in the fields of modern music and culture. The company's first title to depart from historical reproductions was former Beatle George Harrison's autobiography, I, Me, Mine, published in 1980. The 2017 Extended Edition of the latter title, compiled by Harrison's widow Olivia, was the 100th book published by Genesis.

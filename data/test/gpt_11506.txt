Ubiquitin-activating enzymes, also known as E1 enzymes, are a family of enzymes responsible for the ubiquitination of proteins. Ubiquitination is the process by which a protein is marked with ubiquitin, a small protein that is capable of binding to other proteins and modifying their function.  Ubiquitination is an important step in the regulation of protein function, and the ubiquitin-activating enzymes are critical in this process. Ubiquitin-activating enzymes can catalyze the transfer of ubiquitin from one protein to another, and this process is essential for the proper maintenance of cellular proteins.  Ubiquitination is also important for the degradation of proteins and peptides, and the ubiquitin-activating enzymes are essential for this process as well. Through the ubiquitination of proteins, the ubiquitin-activating enzymes play a role in many normal cellular processes, including cell signaling and gene expression.

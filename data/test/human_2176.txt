Ed Keating is a fictional character from the BBC medical drama Holby City, played by actor Rocky Marshall. He first appeared in the series four episode "New Hearts, Old Scores", broadcast on 13 August 2002. Ed arrives at Holby City hospital to work as a cardiothoracic registrar. Ed is characterised as an ambitious "working class" man who learns how to survive hospital politics. He is "extremely loyal" but his aggressive tempter sometimes leads him into trouble. Producers introduced him alongside Tom Campbell-Gore (Denis Lawson) and Ed becomes his protégé. Writers concocted various surgical dilemmas involving organ transplants, which the duo solve in unorthodox ways. Their continued rule breaking sets them both on a journey to disgrace. They forge test results, lie to patients, carry out organ transplants without any consent and Ed lets Tom operate under the influence of alcohol. Producers introduced Ed's father George Keating (Garry Cooper), who had gone to prison for a crime Ed had committed. When an ill George needs a heart transplant, Ed and Tom deceive their colleagues to get George at the top of the transplant list. Tom continued to perform transplants without relative's consent and these stories culminated in both of their departures from the show. Other stories for the character include an affair with ward sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley). She marries Ed's friend Owen Davis (Mark Moraghan). Writers introduced a pregnancy mystery into the story and Chrissie was left wondering who the father is. Ed made his final appearance in the series six episode "If You Can't Do the Time...", which was broadcast on 18 May 2004.

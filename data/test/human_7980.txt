Northwick Park Hospital (NWPH) is a major National Health Service hospital situated near the town of Harrow, North West London, managed by the London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust. It is located off Watford Road in the London Borough of Brent; closely bordering the London Borough of Harrow. History The hospital was commissioned by the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board in the late 1960s, designed by the British architect John Weeks and built by Trollope & Colls. The design of the hospital was largely inspired by British obsolescence studies, in which a loose-jointed medical complex was created with flexibility to withstand obsolescence's unpredictable effects. With only a fixed internal street system, the architects referred to the hospital as "an indeterminate architecture" with "no final plan" â€“ free to grow and change over time. It was opened by the Queen on 10 October 1970. It takes its name from Northwick Park, which is next to it.

A well cluster, also referred to as a water well, is an archeological feature consisting of a group of interconnected wells, typically found in cultures with developed irrigation systems. Well clusters were common in the ancient Near East and Mediterranean region, and are still found in parts of Africa and South Asia.  Well clusters are often associated with ancient civilizations because they can provide evidence of the extent and sophistication of these societies' water management systems. They can also be a valuable source of archaeological information about the way people lived and interacted.  Well clusters can be found in a variety of different environments, including dryland and coastal sites, urban and rural areas, and even underwater sites. They can be difficult to identify because they may appear similar to other archeological features, such as mounds or pits.  Well clusters can be divided into two categories based on their function: utilitarian wells and ceremonial wells. Utilitarian wells were used to supply water for drinking, irrigation, or sanitation purposes. Ceremonial wells were used for religious purposes, such as worshiping or offering sacrifices.  Well clusters are an important source of information about the history of water management and irrigation systems. They can help archaeologists understand the way people lived and interacted with their environment.

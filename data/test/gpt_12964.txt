Ribonuclease H (abbreviated RNase H or RNH) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of ribonucleotide bonds in RNA. RNase H also cleaves other RNA molecules, including messenger RNA (mRNA), tRNA, rRNA, and small interfering RNA (siRNA). RNase H is important in the process of gene expression and is also used to study the function of RNA molecules.  Ribonuclease H was first isolated from a strain of the fungus Aspergillus niger in 1961. The enzyme is encoded by the RNASEH gene. RNase H is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain, which is then processed into several subunits. The active enzyme is a heterodimer consisting of two subunits, RNASEH1 and RNASEH2. RNase H activity depends on the presence of both subunits; when one subunit is missing, the enzyme is inactive.  Ribonuclease H can cleave single-stranded nucleic acids at specific points called recognition sites. The cleavage results in the release of a short 3'-5' oligonucleotide chain called an exonucleotide. The remaining nucleic acid strand is called the intronucleotide. RNase H can also cleave long double-stranded DNA molecules, but this activity is much less common.  Ribonuclease H activity can be regulated by several factors, including temperature, concentration, and pH. The enzyme becomes more active

Nunzio is a 1978 American drama film written and directed by Peter Bogdanovich. It is based on the novel of the same name by Salvatore Scarpetta.  The film tells the story of a corrupt New York City police detective, Nunzio (played by Peter Fonda), and his attempt to rehabilitate himself after he is released from prison. The story is set against the backdrop of the Mafia's war against each other in New York City in the 1970s.  The film received mixed reviews from critics, but was a box office success. Fonda's performance was praised, as was Bogdanovich's direction.

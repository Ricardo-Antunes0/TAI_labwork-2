The Duddingston Loch Hoard, currently held by the National Museum of Scotland, comprises over 2,000 objects dating from the late Iron Age to the early medieval period. The hoard was discovered in 1894 during construction of a hydroelectric power station on the River Duddon near the village of Duddingston, in the Scottish Borders.   The hoard is particularly notable for its richness in items relating to Pictish art and culture, including a number of Pictish stones and carved animal pieces. It is also noteworthy for its quantity and quality of silver jewelry, including a number of coins and brooches.

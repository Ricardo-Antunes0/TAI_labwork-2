The Bris sextant  is not a sextant proper, but is a small angle-measuring device that can be used for navigation. The Bris is, however, a true reflecting instrument which derives its high accuracy from the same principle of double reflection which is fundamental to the octant, the true sextant, and other reflecting instruments. It differs from other sextants primarily in being a fixed angle sextant, capable of measuring a few specific angles. Sven Yrvind (Lundin) developed his Bris sextant as part of his quest for low-cost, low-technology equipment for ocean crossings. The Bris is a low-technology, high-precision, fixed-interval instrument. It is made of two narrow, flat pieces of glass (microscope slides) permanently and rigidly mounted in a V-shape to a third flat piece of #12 welding glass to make viewing the sun eye safe. When the sun or moon is viewed through the V, it is split into eight images. The instrument is small and rugged enough that it can be kept in a 35mm film canister (about 2 cm radius, 3 cm tall) on a lanyard around one's neck.

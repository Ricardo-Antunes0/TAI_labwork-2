Never So Bold (26 April 1980 â€“ 26 March 2003) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse.  Never So Bold was a chestnut horse with a white blaze and three white socks bred in Kentucky by John W. Galbreath. He was sent to race in Europe, where he became one of the most successful horses of his generation, winning thirteen of his eighteen races, including the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. After his racing career ended, he became a successful breeding stallion, siring many major winners including Never So Dull, Never So Tired and Never So Young. He died at the age of twenty-six after developing laminitis.  Never So Bold was undefeated as a two-year-old, winning five races including the Sussex Stakes and the July Cup. As a three-year-old he won nine races including the Prix Royal-Oak, Ireland's Champion Stakes and the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. In October he won the prestigious Premio Roma.  Never So Bold retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in France. His most successful offspring were Never So Dull who won the 2000 French Derby, 2001 Irish Derby and 2002 Japan Cup and Never So Tired who won the 2002 Epsom Derby and 2003 Queen Elizabeth II Stakes.

Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance, one arrives at the usual mathematical equation that describes this relationship: where  is the current through the conductor in units of amperes, V is the voltage measured across the conductor in units of volts,  and R is the resistance of the conductor in units of ohms.  More specifically, Ohm's law states that the R in this relation is constant, independent of the current.  If the resistance is not constant, the previous equation cannot be called Ohm's law, but it can still be used as a definition of static/DC resistance.  Ohm's law is an empirical relation which accurately describes the conductivity of the vast majority of electrically conductive materials over many orders of magnitude of current.  However some materials do not obey Ohm's law; these are called non-ohmic.

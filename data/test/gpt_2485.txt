The West Coast Avengers is a fictional team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The team, originally consisting of the superhero Captain America, the Black Widow, the Falcon, the Scarlet Witch, and Hawkeye, was founded by writer Stan Lee and artist Don Heck in Avengers #57 (March 1976), during the period following the events of The Death of Captain America.  The team's membership has fluctuated over time, with various members joining and leaving, but it has typically consisted of a mix of veterans and new recruits. The team has also been involved in various storylines that have crossed over with other Marvel teams and characters.  The West Coast Avengers first appeared in a self-titled series which ran for 18 issues from 1976 to 1978. They then starred in their own series from 1979 to 1983, which was followed by an eponymous series from 1985 to 1987. The team appeared sporadically throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, usually as part of one-shot or short-run series. They returned to their own series in 2005, which ended after 33 issues in 2009. The team has not had an ongoing series since then.

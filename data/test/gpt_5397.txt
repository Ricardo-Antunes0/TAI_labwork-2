Ripples is the seventh studio album by Australian alternative rock band The Paper Kites. It was released on 23 March 2017 through Liberation Music.  The album was preceded by the single "Goodbye" on 25 January 2017.  The Paper Kites began work on their seventh studio album in early 2016, with producer John Congleton (St. Vincent, The National) at the helm. The band toured in support of their previous album, "Dear Science" in 2016 and 2017, before beginning work on the new album.  "Ripples" is an emotional and introspective album that lyrically focuses on the band's experiences of growing up and maturing. It features a more acoustic and stripped-back sound than their previous albums, with frontman Oli Sykes describing it as "a bit more intimate".  The first single from the album, "Goodbye", was released on 25 January 2017. The second single, "River", was released on 16 April 2017.

Pacific Sisters is a collective of Pacific and Māori artists, performers, fashion designers, jewellers and musicians. Establishment and early years The collective was formed in 1992 by Selina Forsyth (Samoan) Niwhai Tupaea (Ngāti Katoa) and Suzanne Tamaki (Tūhoe, Te Arawa, Ngāti Maniapoto).  The sisterhood also includes Rosanna Raymond (Samoan), Feeonaa Wall (Samoan), Ani O'Neill (Cook Islands), Lisa Reihana (Ngā Puhi), Jaunnie Ilolahia (Tongan) and is inclusive of Pacific Soles: Henry Taripo (Cook Islands) and Karlos Quartez (Cook Islands) and Greg Semu (Samoan).   Throughout the 1990s Pacific Sisters collaborated in the production of fashion shows, art performances and musical events. Karen Stevenson, author of The Frangipani is Dead: Contemporary Pacific Art in New Zealand  writes, “Challenging the established art canon, The Pacific Sisters combined costume, tradition, dance and the catwalk with the energetic rhythms of hip hop”. The Sisters created a stage for expression of urban Māori and Pacific identity within New Zealand, as Jacqueline Charles Rault wrote ‘The Pacific Sisters were and remain provocative, sexy and rebellious’   In 1994 Pacific Sisters performed at the Auckland Art Gallery for the opening of Bottled Ocean, curated by Jim Vivieaere. In 1996 the Sisters were invited and also received funding from Creative New Zealand to perform in Samoa for the seventh Festival of Pacific Arts: Tala Measina. They developed Motu Tangata, a contemporary realisation of the narrative of Ina/Hina and Tuna. The festival abstained from officially hosting Motu Tangata, aware of the implications a contemporary style of performance such as Motu Tangata could have at an event that celebrated customary practices from the Pacific. For two consecutive nights however, the Sisters performed Motu Tangata at the Hotel Kitano Tusitala.    In 1998 their performance Tribe Vibe and the Extended Family Mix was selected as part of Sydney's Pacific Wave Festival. 1998 also saw their work exhibited in Tūrangawaewae, the 3rd New Zealand Jewellery Biennale at The Dowse and in Raw Fish, at The Physics Room in Christchurch. In 2000 Pacific Sisters performed at the opening of the Biennale of Sydney in collaboration with Lisa Reihana.

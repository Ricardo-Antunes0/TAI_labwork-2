Next Exit is a studio album by American jazz saxophonist Grover Washington Jr. The album was released in 1992 on Columbia Records label. Next Exit includes composition "Summer Chill" which was co-written by his son and nominated for a Grammy. Reception Steve Aldrich of AllMusic commented "The man who wrote the book on R&B/fusion returns with yet another set of what he does best. Washington's sax shares time with vocal tracks featuring the likes of Nancy Wilson, Lalah Hathaway, and the Four Tops. A solid, if predictible outing". A reviewer of All About Jazz stated "Any Grover excursion is worth listening to and Next Exit is one of Grover's finer outings... There are so many wonderful tracks on this album that it is an essential addition to your own collection of you don't have it already. Fusion Jazz at its very finest and highly recommended by this veteran of the airwaves".

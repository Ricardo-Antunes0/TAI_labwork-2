The Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB), now defunct, was a Canadian bank that was headquartered in Toronto, Ontario. LCB was founded in 1957 and grew to become one of the largest banks in Canada. In 2001, LCB was acquired by the National Bank of Canada.  The Lebanese Canadian Bank played an important role in the development and growth of Lebanese-Canadian businesses and communities. The bank provided financing and other services to businesses and individuals in the Canadian economy, as well as providing financial support to humanitarian organizations involved in helping refugees from Lebanon. LCB also played an important role in helping to build relationships between Canada and Lebanon, and served as a gateway for many Lebanese immigrants to settle in Canada.  LCB ceased operations on February 10, 2001, following its acquisition by National Bank of Canada. The bank was later merged into National Bank of Canada's National Commercial Bank subsidiary.

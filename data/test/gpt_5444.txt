The Confederation of Anarcho-Syndicalists (CAS; ; Konfederatsiya Anarcho-Sotsialistov, or KAS) is a global anarchist organization with sections in over 40 countries. CAS was founded in 1922 in the Russian Empire by anarchists who opposed the Bolsheviks and their self-proclaimed "dictatorship of the proletariat".  The main goals of CAS are to promote anarchism and syndicalism, to unite anarchists into a global confederation, and to help anarchist militants organize and carry out strikes, protests, and direct actions. CAS also publishes an international quarterly magazine, "Anarchy", and maintains a website.

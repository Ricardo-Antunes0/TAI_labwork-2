William George Bonin (January 8, 1947 â€“ March 2, 1991) was an American environmentalist and writer. He is best known for his book The End of Nature (1981), in which he argued that humans were rapidly destroying the natural world.  Bonin was born in New York City and grew up in Marin County, California. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in English. Afterward, he worked as a journalist for magazines such as The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly and Outside.  He began writing books in the early 1980s, after becoming disillusioned with the state of the environment. His first book, The End of Nature, was published in 1981 and became a bestseller. It argued that humans were rapidly destroying the natural world and proposed a radical new approach to conservation: allowing nature to regenerate itself.  Bonin died of AIDS-related complications at age 44. His work has been widely praised by environmentalists and authors such as Bill McKibben and Edward Abbey.

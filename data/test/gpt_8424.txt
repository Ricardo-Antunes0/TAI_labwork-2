Nomothetic and idiographic are terms used by linguists to describe the ways in which language is used. Nomothetic describes the use of language as a scientist would - that is, using systematic and rule-based methods to analyze data. Idiographic describes the way in which people actually use language - that is, using personal and individual experiences to form their own judgments about language usage.

Yang Wei (; born 13 January 1979) is a Chinese former badminton player who affiliate with Guangdong provincial team. Career  A woman's doubles specialist, Yang has won some forty international titles, most of them in the sport's top tier events, since 1998. Prior to 2003 she partnered Huang Nanyan with whom she earned a silver medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and gained the winning point against South Korea in the 2002 Uber Cup (women's world team championship) final. Her subsequent partnership with Zhang Jiewen has been even more successful as they have shared international domination with compatriot rivals Gao Ling and Huang Sui. Yang and Zhang captured gold at the 2004 Athens Olympics by defeating Gao and Huang in the final. They bested the same team in winning both the 2005 and 2007 BWF World Championships. On the other hand, Gao and Huang have been an obstacle for them at the prestigious All-England Championships, defeating Yang and Zhang in the 2003, 2004, and 2006 finals. Curiously, this is the one major tournament that neither Yang nor Zhang has ever won.

The Ladder of Jacob (Hebrew: Sulam Yaakov, also known as the Jacob's Ladder, Jacob's Staircase, or even the Syrian Staircase) is a natural rock staircase in Wadi Musa, near the city of Safad in southern Israel. It is named after the biblical figure Jacob, who is said to have used it to escape from an attacking group of men.  The ladder is about high and wide and was formed by erosion of the rock face. It has a series of 17 steps that lead up to a small platform at the top. The staircase was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007.

Hellmuth Stachel (born October 6, 1942 in Greifswald, Germany) is a German mathematician who is known for his work in the theory of operator algebras, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.  Hellmuth Stachel was born on October 6, 1942 in Greifswald, Germany. He studied mathematics at the University of Berlin, where he received his diploma in 1965 and his doctorate in 1968. He worked at the University of Freiburg from 1968 to 1974, and at the University of Heidelberg from 1974 to 1988. Since 1988 he has been a professor at the Technical University of Darmstadt.  Stachel's main research interests are in the theory of operator algebras, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. His contributions to these fields include the development of new methods for solving problems in these areas, as well as the discovery of new phenomena. He is also known for his work on automorphism groups and module theory.  Hellmuth Stachel is a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and the American Mathematical Society.

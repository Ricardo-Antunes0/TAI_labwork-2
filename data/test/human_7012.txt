Gopala Bhatta Goswami (1503â€“1578) is one of the foremost disciples of the Vaishnava saint, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and a leading historical figure in the Gaudiya Vaishnava school of Hinduism. He was part of a group of Vaishnava devotees known collectively as the Six Goswamis of Vrindavan, who were influential in establishing the philosophical basis of the Gaudiya tradition in formalised writings. Background Born in a Sri vaishnava family of  Tamil Iyengar origin in sri rangam, and the son of Venkatta Bhatta, Gopala bhatta goswami was a great devotee of Laxmi-Narayana. According to biographies such as the Bhakti Ratnakara Gopal Bhatta's first meeting with Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was in 1510 during Mahaprabhu's tour of South India. Although of a young age he was given the opportunity to meet with Chaitanya and serve him over a number of months. Such was his love for the saint, that when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was about to leave, Gopala Bhatta became upset, and for Gopala Bhatta's sake, Chaitanya then agreed to stay a few more days.

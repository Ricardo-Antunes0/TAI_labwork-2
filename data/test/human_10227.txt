The so-called Saardom (full name: "Ecclesia Parochialis Catholica Sacratissimi Sacramenti Dioecesis Treverensis", "Catholic Parish Church of the Blessed Sacrament in the Diocese of Trier") in Dillingen/Saar is one of the largest sacred buildings in Saarland. It is the parish church of the parish of St Sacrament. The parish belongs to the parish community of the Holy Sacrament, St John the Baptist in Dillingen, St Joseph and St Wendelin in Diefflen, St Maximin in Pachten, and St Mary consolation of the saddeneds (Consolatrix afflictorum) on the Pachtener Heide. The church belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier. The feast of dedication is the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ. The church was built between 1910 and 1913 according to plans by the Trier church-architect Peter Marx (1871-1958), mainly in the Neo-Romanesque style. The prototypes of the Saardom include the towers of the Bamberg Cathedral, the towers of the cathedrals of Laon and Naumburg, and the facade of the Cathedral of Metz.

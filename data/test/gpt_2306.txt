Livingstone Wellesley Bethel (born Nassau, New Providence, Bahamas, on July 4, 1918) is an American historian and the so-called "Father of Bahamian History."  Bethel was educated at the College of the Bahamas and then at the University of Chicago, where he received his B.A. in 1940 and his Ph.D. in 1951. He spent his early career as a history professor at the University of Miami (1941-1945), then served as a research associate at Princeton University (1946-1951) and as a history professor at Yale University (1951-1968). He was chairman of the history department at Yale from 1968 to 1975.  Bethel is best known for his monumental two-volume work, The History of the Greater Bahamas (published in 1976 and 1981), which synthesizes Bahamian history from Pre-Columbian times to the present day. Bethel also wrote extensively on colonial Bahamian history, plantation life, economic development, and social change in the Bahamas. His other books include The Bahamas: A History from Pre-Columbian Times to the Present (1983), The Bahamas: A Constitutional History, 1783-1983 (1984), The Bahamas: The Making of an Island Nation (1985), The Bahamas: Politics and Society since 1783 (1990), Caribbean Crossroads: A History of the Bahamian People (1994), and A Concise History of the Commonwealth of Nations (1999).

Cochin is a serif typeface. It was originally produced in 1912 by Georges Peignot for the Paris foundry G. Peignot et Fils (future Deberny & Peignot) and was based on the copperplate engravings of 18th century French artist Charles-Nicolas Cochin, from which the typeface also takes its name. The font has a small x-height with long ascenders. Georges Peignot also created the design 'Nicolas-Cochin' as a looser variation in the same style. Characteristics With a very low x-height and delicate design, Cochin is described by Walter Tracy an example of a style of lettering and graphic design popular in the early twentieth century in several countries. Similar designs are Astr√©e and later Bernhard Modern and Koch-Antiqua, as well as several designs by Frederic Goudy such as Pabst and Goudy Modern.  It had considerable success, for example becoming available on Monotype's hot metal typesetting system in the United States (Tracy describes this version as disappointing due to changes to the italic) and was also sold by American Type Founders.

Node graph architecture is a software design pattern that emerged in the early 2000s. It is a way to organize code into a tree-like structure, where each node in the tree represents a complete and self-contained component.  Node graph architectures can be used to improve modularity and reusability in code, as well as to make it easier to understand and maintain. They can also help developers avoid dependencies on other parts of the system, which can lead to improved reliability and performance.

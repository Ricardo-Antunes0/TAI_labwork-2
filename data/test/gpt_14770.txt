Calcific tendinitis is a common condition where thick, inflammatory bands form around the tendons in the affected area. It is most commonly seen in the feet and ankle, but can also occur in other areas of the body.  Calcific tendinitis presents with pain and tenderness around the affected tendon, which may progress over time to inflammation and swelling. Treatment often involves rest and a period of physical therapy to help improve tendon function.

HMS Amboyna was the Dutch brig Harlingen, of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), which was captured by HMS Ambuscade on 10 August 1796 during the French Revolutionary Wars. The brig was taken into Royal Navy service as HMS Amboyna.   The Harlingen had sailed from the Cape of Good Hope on 5 August 1796 with a cargo of diamonds, gold, and ivory. On 10 August, the brig was captured by HMS Ambuscade, under the command of Captain Thomas Troubridge. The crew of the Harlingen were all taken into Royal Navy service, with Troubridge giving command of the ship to Lieutenant Johnstone. The Harlingen was initially taken to Portsmouth, where it was examined for treasure. However, no treasure was found and the ship was instead sold to the French Navy. The Harlingen served in the French Navy as L'Ã‰toile (2).

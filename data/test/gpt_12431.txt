Luo Tong (193â€“228), courtesy name Gongxu, was a late Han Dynasty scholar, poet, and calligrapher. He is best known for his work on the Shi Jing, a classic Chinese epic poem.  Luo Tong was born in 193 in the town of Xiangyang in Hunan province. He was educated at the prestigious Jinsha School, where he studied under the tutelage of Xu Shen and Zhang Yi. He later became an instructor at the school.  Luo Tong's fame as a scholar began to grow during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87 BCE). In 196, he wrote a commentary on the Shi Jing entitled Luo Guanzhong ji jing suo. This work is generally considered to be his masterpiece.  Luo Tong also wrote poetry, including an elegy on the death of Emperor Wu's son, Emperor Hui of Han (r. 189-187 BCE). In 228, he died in Changsha in Hunan province.

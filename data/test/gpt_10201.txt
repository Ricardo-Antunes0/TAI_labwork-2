The Capture of Brielle by the Watergeuzen, a Dutch naval force, was a battle fought on 2 July 1572 near the town of Brielle in Flanders. The Spanish army commanded by Don Juan de Austria, Duke of Alba, had crossed the Scheldt River the previous day and was marching north to meet the invading Dutch army under the command of William of Orange.   The Watergeuzen, consisting mainly of Protestant refugees from the Spanish Netherlands, were poorly armed and inexperienced but they made up for these deficiencies with their courage and determination. After a fierce battle, in which the Spanish were repeatedly driven back, Alba was killed and the Spanish army was defeated. This victory led to the Dutch Republic becoming a major power in Europe.

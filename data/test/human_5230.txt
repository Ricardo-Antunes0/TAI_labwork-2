Typhoon Nelson, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Bising, was the second tropical cyclone to strike the Philippines within a week in March 1982. Nelson originated from a tropical disturbance southeast of Guam towards the middle of March. Although the system was initially poorly organized, it developed rather quickly, and was upgraded into Tropical Storm Nelson on March 19. It tracked westward, and fluctuated in intensity for several days. On March 24, Typhoon Nelson intensified into a typhoon, and entered an episode of rapid intensification. On March 25, Nelson reached its peak intensity of , but thereafter moved ashore on the Philippines, where the storm weakened significantly. On March 27, the typhoon entered the South China Sea, and the next day, briefly re-intensified before resuming a weakening trend. Nelson dissipated on March 31. Affecting the nation less than a week after Tropical Storm Mamie did, Nelson was responsible for additional flooding across much of the Philippines. Fifty-six people were killed due to the typhoon, eight of whom perished due to drownings. Over 1,200 homes were destroyed. More than 165,000 people fled to shelters, including 83,000 that were displaced from their home. Thirty fishing boats and 23 ferries were destroyed due to the system. Damage amounted to $17.2 million (1982 USD). Meteorological history

The Apostolic Brethren (sometimes referred to as the Brethren Movement) is a Christian religious group originating in the United States. It is generally considered to be a fundamentalist Protestant group.  The Apostolic Brethren trace their origins back to the Pentecostal movement of the early 20th century. After Pentecostalism began to splinter into various denominations, the Apostolic Brethren sought to maintain a unique and cohesive Christian identity. In 1942, the group formally incorporated as a religious organization.  The Apostolic Brethren are best known for their strict adherence to the Bible, which they see as the only authoritative source of doctrine. They also adhere to a number of distinctive Pentecostal practices, including speaking in tongues and faith healing. The Apostolic Brethren have been accused of promoting an anti-Semitic agenda, and they have been the subject of several lawsuits alleging religious discrimination.  The Apostolic Brethren are currently estimated to have between 10,000 and 15,000 members worldwide.

Mehfil Magazine was a Canadian-based South Asian lifestyle magazine, launched in 1993 by brothers Rana and Minto Vig. It was the first full colour South Asian glossy magazine of its kind in Canada. Their idea was simply to produce a periodical that would not only showcase the community to its own, but also provide a tool and a bridge to foster better cross-cultural harmony and understanding. The word "Mehfil" means "a gathering". During its run, Mehfil Magazine featured the South Asian community's leading business men and women, writers, artists, social workers, law enforcement, politicians and students. It also tackled some of the South Asian community's toughest social and political issues, including the Air India bombing, sexual abuse, arranged marriages, health concerns such as diabetes, the plight of seniors, as well as the cultural challenges of a new generation trying to integrate. The magazine ceased publication in 2010. Notable Contributors Rick Hansen, Guest columnist Mehfil Magazine April/May 1998 Peter C.

The Joint Economic Forecast (Gemeinschaftsdiagnose, GD) is a semiannual report that aims to analyze the German and the world economy, while also providing in-depth policy recommendations for the German Federal Government. Each publication comprises a projection for the current and following years, along with a special study of varying topics. First published in 1950, the GD is prepared by Germany's leading economic research institutes, which are members of the Leibniz Association. History The GD, originally known as the Forecast, began in 1950 under the direction of six institutes, which were then members of the Association of German Economic Research Institutes (ARGE). It began in the years of post-World War 2 reconstruction as a means of facilitating Germany's reintegration into the global economy. The participating institutes until 2007 included:  Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW)  German Institute for Economic Research (DIW)  Hamburg World Economic Archive (HWWA, until 2006)  Ifo Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich (ifo)  Institute for Economic Research Halle (IWH)  Rheinisch-Westfälisches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung (RWI)

Armadillidium phalacronum is a European species of woodlouse endemic to Greece. It is a relatively small-sized species that probably belongs to the so-called "Armadillidium insulanum complex". Taxonomy Armadilliidum phalacronum was described as a distinct species of Armadillidium in 2008, based on specimens collected as far back as 1987. Additionally, the species is also thought to belong to the "Armadillidium insulanum complex", a group of closely related, small-sized pill bugs that occur in various Aegean Islands and the nearby Greek and Turkish coasts. Specifically, within this group, Armadillidium phalacronum is probably most closely related to Armadillidium insulanum sensu lato, from which it can be separated by the curvature of the upper margin of the frontal shield (straight in A. phalacronum vs rounded in A. insulanum), the shape of the antennae lobes (rounded in A. phalacronum vs trapezoidal in A. insulanum) and the length of the posterior lobe of the exopodite of the first pleopod of the male (longer in A. phalacronum).

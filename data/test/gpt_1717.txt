Michael Lawrence Crick (born 21 May 1958) is a British molecular biologist and biophysicist who has made significant contributions to the understanding of the molecular structure of DNA. He is currently a Professor at the University of Cambridge.  Crick was born in London, England to Jewish parents. He attended Westminster School and read physics at University College, Oxford where he was awarded a first class degree in 1980. He then undertook postgraduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he was awarded his doctorate in 1985 for work on the structure of DNA. Following his doctoral studies, Crick went to work at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. In 1991 he moved to the University of Cambridge where he has since been a Professor.  Crick's research has been focused on the structure and function of DNA molecules. His early work focused on the determination of the base sequence of DNA, and his later work has concentrated on understanding the role that DNA plays in biological processes. He has also made significant contributions to the understanding of how genetic information is transferred from one organism to another.  Crick is a fellow of both the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Royal Society and a member of numerous other scientific societies. In 2004 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Bristol. He was knighted in 2009 for services to molecular biology.

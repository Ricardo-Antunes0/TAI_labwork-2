Luckeus is a genus of prehistoric lobe-finned fish.  The genus Luckeus is a small and obscure lobe-finned fish that lived during the Early Eocene epoch. The genus is known from a single fossil specimen, which was found in Germany. The fossil was first described by paleontologist Nicolaus Schlosser in 1984.  Luckeus is a small fish, measuring only 2.5 cm long. It has a relatively large head and a slender body. Its fins are short and weak, and it lacks any scales. Luckeus is the only known species of the genus, and it is currently classified as a valid genus within the family Luckeidae.  There is very little information available about Luckeus, and much of what is known about it is based on the single fossil specimen that has been found. However, based on this information, it is possible to say that Luckeus likely lived in shallow water environments and fed on small prey items. It is also possible to say that the genus likely went extinct during the Early Eocene epoch, which was around 50 million years ago.

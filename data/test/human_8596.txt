Orchard Road is a major north-south road carrying traffic through Kane and Kendall Counties in northeast Illinois.  It exists as a county highway in both counties.  It runs from Oswego through Aurora to North Aurora, where it connects with Randall Road.  Much traffic continues northward on Randall Road to access Batavia, Illinois and points northward in the Fox Valley. Route description  Having mostly been a 2-lane road until the early 2000s, Orchard Road is now largely a four-lane major road running on the west sides of Aurora, Montgomery, and Oswego, paralleling the Fox River.  It is commonly used as a western alternative to Illinois Routes 31 and 25, which run in close proximity to the Fox River.  Because Routes 25 and 31 run through downtown Aurora and Oswego, they have lower speed limits and more obstructions to smooth traffic.  Orchard Road's speed limit is 45 for most of its length, never dipping below 40, and it has four lanes for most of its length, making Orchard Road the route of choice for many travelers moving north-south through these locales.

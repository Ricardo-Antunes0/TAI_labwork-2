Deep drawing is a sheet metal forming process that starts with a cold drawing of the part to be formed. The part is then heated until it can be drawn easily. This is done by gradually raising the temperature until it reaches a point where the metal can be pulled away from the die. The part is then cooled slowly to prevent distortion.

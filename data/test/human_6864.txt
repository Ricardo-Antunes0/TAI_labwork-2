A canner participates in canning, the collection and redemption of deposit-marked beverage containers for recycling. Canning is an activity undertaken by individuals or small teams, typically to earn an income. Canning is only possible in nations, states, or municipalities which have enacted container-deposit legislation. Container deposits  The primary aim of container-deposit legislation is mitigation of the environmental impact of materials used in the creation of the containers, especially plastic. Another purpose is to facilitate the recycling of container materials such as glass and aluminum, as well as plastic. As there is a wide variety across different political entities which operate container-deposit programs, in terms of infrastructural support and deposit amount, the economic viability of canning as an income-generating activity varies from municipality to municipality. In some places, container-deposit programs have resulted in drastic reductions in street litter and increases in recycling. In 2012, the German Federal Environment Agency reported that 96% of deposit-market containers were returned via their program.

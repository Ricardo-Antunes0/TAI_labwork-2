The Chorus of Westerly is a 190-voice chorus based in Westerly, Rhode Island. It is one of the few choruses in the United States that has children singing alongside adults for every performance of its season (regardless of work or difficulty). Members of the chorus come from all over Rhode Island and southeastern Connecticut, with some members coming from as far as Bristol, Middlesex and Norfolk counties in Massachusetts. As part of its typical season, the chorus will present two "classical" concert series (one in November and one in May),  a series of Christmas Pops concerts in December, seven performances of "A Celebration of Twelfth Night" in January (a musical and theatrical event based on an originally written stage play set in medieval times), a guest choral ensemble in February, an 'a cappella' concert series in March,  and Summer Pops, a large outdoor performance held in Westerly's Wilcox Park for audiences of 25,000 each June.  For its classical and pops events, the Chorus performs with professional orchestral musicians from the Boston Musicians Association and from across Rhode Island. Over its fifty-seven seasons, the Chorus of Westerly has performed many of the most important choral works ever written, from J.S. Bach's Mass in B Minor to William Walton's Belshazzar's Feast.  In recent seasons, the chorus has performed Durufl√©'s Requiem, Mozart's Mass in C Minor, Vaughan Williams' Hodie, and Honegger's King David.  The chorus has also given the American premiere performance of several British choral works of the past century.  This list includes "Songs of the Fleet" by Charles Villiers Stanford, "Lux Aeterna" by William Mathias, "Birthday Madrigals" by John Rutter, "Mass of the Sea" by Paul Patterson and several other works of George Dyson, Patrick Hadley and Gilbert Vinters.

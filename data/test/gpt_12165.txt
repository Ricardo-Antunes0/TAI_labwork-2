A sympoliteia , anglicized as sympolity, was an Ancient Greek term for a social or political agreement.  The word was first used in the Aristotelian Corpus, where it refers to an agreement between two or more parties. In this sense, it can be seen as a synonym for pact. Later, the term came to be used more generally to refer to any sort of formal agreement between two or more parties.

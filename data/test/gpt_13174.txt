Containerization is a system of intermodal freight transport in which individual cargo containers are transported together as a unit. The system is most often used for shipping goods by sea, but can be used for other modes of transport, such as rail and highway.  Containerization has several advantages over traditional methods of freight transport. These advantages include:   - Reduced Costs: Containerized freight trains are more efficient than trucks or ships when moving large volumes of cargo. Additionally, containerized freight can be moved faster and with less environmental impact than traditional methods. - Reduced Waiting Time: When cargo is shipped in containers, it is typically delivered to the destination much faster than if it were shipped in individual packages. This is because containers can be assembled in a relatively short time and transported to the destination using a maritime container ship or railcar. - Improved Safety: Containerized freight trains are much safer than trucks, since they are less likely to overturn. This is because containers are tightly packed and do not generate a lot of extra weight on the outside of the truck. - Increased Capacity: Containerization allows freight to be transported in larger quantities than would be possible with traditional methods. This allows businesses to take advantage of increased market opportunities and makes it easier to meet customer demand.

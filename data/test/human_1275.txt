Pterostylis crassa, commonly known as the coarse leafy greenhood,  is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to Victoria. As with similar greenhoods, plants in flower differ from those that are not. Those not in flower have a rosette of leaves on a short stalk but when flowering, plants have up to four relatively large, shiny dark green translucent flowers on a flowering stem with stem leaves. Description Pterostylis crassa, is a terrestrial,  perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. When not in flower, plants have a rosette of between three and six leaves, each leaf  long and  wide on a stalk  high. Plants in flower lack a rosette but have up to four flowers on a flowering spike  high with between three and six linear to lance-shaped stem leaves that are  long and  wide. The flowers are  long,  wide. The dorsal sepal and petals are joined to form a hood called the "galea" over the column. The galea is transparent green with darker green lines and a brown or green, tapered tip. The lateral sepals turn downwards and are  long,  wide and joined for about half their length. The labellum is  long, about  wide and light brown with a dark stripe along its mid-line. Flowering occurs from September to October.

A rights issue or rights offer is a means of raising capital by selling securities to investors who are given the right to purchase shares at a pre-determined price.  A rights issue is a way of issuing new securities, where investors who purchase the securities are given the right to purchase additional securities at a later date at a pre-determined price. Rights issues are common in the United States, where they are used by companies to raise money by issuing new shares to the public.  The benefits of a rights issue depend on the terms of the offer. In general, rights issues are beneficial for companies because they allow them to raise money quickly and easily. They are also beneficial for investors because they allow them to invest in new and exciting projects without having to commit to buying a large number of shares.  The main disadvantage of rights issues is that they can be risky for companies. If the terms of the offer are not favorable to investors, they may not be willing to purchase the additional securities. Additionally, if the company fails to meet expectations after issuing new securities, investors may lose money.

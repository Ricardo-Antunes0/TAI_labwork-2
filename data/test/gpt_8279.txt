Jewels of Stringology: Text Algorithms is a book on text algorithms and their applications to the analysis and manipulation of strings. It is divided into three parts:  The first part of the book covers basic concepts of text algorithms, including word representations, string metrics, and string matching algorithms. The second part focuses on string pattern recognition, including both traditional and deep learning methods. The third and final part deals with various application cases, including text data mining and information retrieval.  The book is written by a team of experts in the field of text analysis and machine learning, and will be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of stringology.

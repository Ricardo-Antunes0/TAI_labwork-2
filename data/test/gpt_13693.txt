Barry Sussman (born July 10, 1934) is an American mathematician, most noted for his contributions to the theory of partial differential equations.  Sussman was born in 1934 in Brooklyn, New York. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan in 1955 and his PhD from Yale University in 1959 under the supervision of John von Neumann.  After postdoctoral work at MIT, Sussman joined the faculty of Princeton University in 1965. He was promoted to professor in 1978 and retired from Princeton in 2001. He is currently an Emeritus Professor at the University of California, Davis.  Sussman has made seminal contributions to the theory of partial differential equations, particularly in the areas of deformable PDEs and conformal PDEs. His work has been influential not only within mathematics but also within physics and engineering. He is a fellow of the American Mathematical Society, the American Physical Society, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

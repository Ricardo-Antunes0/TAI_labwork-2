Wings Alliance was the working name of a proposed international alliance of commercial aviation companies. The alliance was first proposed by the CEO of Airlines for America (A4A), Michael O'Leary, in a speech to the European Commercial Aviation Conference on 10 October 2007.   The proposal called for the creation of an alliance of airlines with the goal of reducing air travel costs for consumers. The alliance would have been composed of airlines from North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. The airline members would have been required to adhere to a common set of pricing, service, and governance standards. O'Leary expressed the hope that the alliance would create a "level playing field" for airlines and help them compete against foreign carriers.  The proposal met with mixed reactions from airline executives and industry observers. Some viewed it as a way to reduce competition and increase prices for consumers; others saw it as a way to create a more harmonized global aviation marketplace. In December 2007, A4A announced that it had abandoned the Wings Alliance proposal.  Wings Alliance was proposed by Michael O'Leary, CEO of Airlines for America (A4A).

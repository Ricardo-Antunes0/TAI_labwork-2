Whitshed Keene (c. 1731–1822) was an Irish antiquarian, numismatist and historian.  Keene was born in 1731, the son of Edward Keene of Doneraile, County Cork, and his second wife, Elizabeth (née Butler). He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated with an M.A. in 1755. He then travelled in France and Italy, where he became interested in ancient coins and medals. In 1768 he became curator of the Irish Museum at Dublin.  Keene married Anne-Marie-Madeleine de La Fayette in 1768. Together they had a daughter and two sons. The elder son Edward succeeded his father as Whitshed Keene II and became a noted numismatist in his own right. The younger son, Richard Keene, became an Irish judge and antiquarian.  Keene died in 1822 and was buried at St John's Churchyard, Doneraile. His papers were bequeathed to Trinity College, Dublin, where they are now housed in the Historical Collection.

Maryam Modjaz is a German-American astrophysicist who is known for her work on active galactic nuclei.  Maryam Modjaz was born in Germany in 1976. She moved to the United States in 1995, and obtained her PhD from Harvard University in 2002. After post-doctoral research at the University of California, Santa Cruz, she became a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2006.  Modjaz's work is focused on active galactic nuclei, which are regions of the universe that are actively producing energy and light. Her research has shown that these nuclei are powered by the merger of two galaxies, and that they are a key component in the formation of new galaxies. She has also made contributions to the understanding of how supermassive black holes grow, and how galactic collisions can create new stars.  In 2016, Modjaz was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She is also a fellow of the American Physical Society and the European Physical Society.

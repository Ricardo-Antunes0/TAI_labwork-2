Sanders' Knoxville Raid (June 14â€“24, 1863) saw 1,500 Union cavalry and mounted infantry led by Colonel William P. Sanders raid East Tennessee before the Knoxville campaign during the American Civil War. The successful raid began at Mount Vernon, Kentucky and moved south, passing near Kingston, Tennessee. Moving east from the Kingston area, the raiders struck the East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad at Lenoir Station. The Union horsemen rode northeast along the railroad, destroying track, bridges, and property useful to the Confederate States of America. Blocked from seizing Knoxville by its 1,000 Confederate defenders, Sanders' horsemen destroyed a major bridge across the Holston River at Strawberry Plains on the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad. After wrecking a smaller bridge at Mossy Creek, the raiders turned northwest, evading pursuers by slipping through an obscure gap in the Cumberland Plateau. Sanders' men reached Boston, Kentucky on June 24, having captured and paroled over 400 Confederate soldiers while sustaining minimal losses in men but considerable losses in horses. Background Since the start of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln and other government authorities urged Union generals to invade East Tennessee. There were two reasons for this. First, a large part of the East Tennessee population remained loyal to the government in Washington, D.C. and seethed under Confederate occupation. Second, a key railroad through the region connected Virginia with the western Confederate states. The East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad linked Knoxville with Chattanooga, Tennessee and Dalton, Georgia, while the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad connected Knoxville with Bristol, Virginia. Logistics was the major obstacle keeping Union forces from seizing East Tennessee. There were no railroads linking the region with Union-occupied areas of Kentucky, and the wagon roads across the Cumberland Plateau became very difficult to use in bad weather. Supplying an invading army with necessities by wagon promised to be challenging. Lincoln hoped to build a railroad, but its construction was not attempted because it would have taken too long. Therefore, Union commanders directed their efforts to capturing Middle Tennessee in 1862.

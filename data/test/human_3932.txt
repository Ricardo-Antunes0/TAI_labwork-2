"Lies" is the fifteenth single from British pop rock band, McFly, released on 15 September 2008. "Lies" did not feature on the promotional 10-track copy of the album Radio:Active which was given away in The Mail on Sunday in July 2008, however it features as one of the four additional tracks on the retail edition of the album, which was released on 22 September 2008. The lead vocals for the song are split between band members Danny Jones and Tom Fletcher, with vocal contributions from bassist Dougie Poynter. Upon release, the song reached No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 1 on the Scottish Singles Chart. Background "Lyrically, Lies is definitely the darkest song we've ever written," says Tom Fletcher, who shares vocals on the track with Danny Jones. "It's about a real bitch of a girl who is out for herself and doesn't care who she uses to get what she wants. We did have a girl in mind when we wrote it, but really it's an amalgam of several girls we have met along the way. We hope she burns in hell at the end. A real good time tune then!" On 17 September 2008 the song was added to BBC Radio 1's A-List and BBC Radio 2's A-List.

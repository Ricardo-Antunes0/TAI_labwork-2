Due South is a Canadian crime comedy drama television series created by Paul Haggis, and produced by Alliance Communications from its premiere on April 26, 1994, to its conclusion after four seasons on March 14, 1999. The series starred Paul Gross, David Marciano, Gordon Pinsent, Beau Starr, Catherine Bruhier, Camilla Scott, Ramona Milano, and Callum Keith Rennie. The show follows the adventures of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer Benton Fraser, who becomes attached to the Canadian consulate in Chicago after solving the murder of his father, and works alongside a detective of the Chicago Police Department to solve crimes.  Both are aided at times by Fraser's deaf white wolf. The show's format mixed between elements of a police drama, and comedy derived between the stereotypical differences between Canadian and American culture at the time. It also included elements of fantasy derived from Gross' character being visited upon by the memory of his father who often provides mixed advice on certain situations. The series itself was mostly filmed in Toronto, and was assisted with financing on later seasons by the BBC, which aired episodes on British television.

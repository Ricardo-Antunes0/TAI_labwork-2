Pluteus leoninus, commonly known as lion shield, is a species of fungus in the family Pluteaceae. It is found in North America, where it grows on the ground in coniferous forests.  The specific epithet "leoninus" is derived from the Latin word "leoninus", meaning "of lion". This is in reference to the characteristic spines on the fruit bodies of P. leoninus. The common name is also derived from this feature.  Pluteus leoninus is a large, brown fungus with spiny fruit bodies (fruiting bodies). The spines are raised, thin, and brown, and are up to long. The cap is convex, broadly bell-shaped or nearly spherical, and measures up to wide. The surface is dry and cracked, and covered with small pimples. The gills are moderately broad and pale brown, and measure up to long. The stipe is stout, up to long, and has a bulbous base. The flesh is brown and membranous, with no discernible taste or odor. The spore print is white.  The fungus grows on the ground in coniferous forests throughout North America, where it fruits in late summer or early fall. It is reported to be common in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. P. leoninus grows parasitically on "Fagus grandifolia" and "Quercus" species.  Pluteus leoninus is classified as an endangered species

The Quilt National is a juried biennial exhibition of quilts of all shapes and sizes, from professional pieces to home made quilts. It is the only exhibition of its kind in the United States.  The Quilt National was founded in 1984 by Beverly Ziegler, with the goal of promoting quilt art and education. The exhibition has been held every two years in different cities across the United States.   Quilts are often thought of as a feminine craft, but the Quilt National showcases a wide range of quilts from all skill levels, from professional pieces to home made quilts. This exhibition is a great opportunity for quilters of all levels to share their work with the community.

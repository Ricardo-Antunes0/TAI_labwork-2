HD 47366 is the Henry Draper Catalogue designation for a star in the southern constellation of Canis Major. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 6.12, which puts it near the lower limit of stars visible to the naked eye. According to the Bortle scale, it can be viewed from dark rural skies. Parallax measurements performed by the Gaia spacecraft provide a distance estimate of roughly . This is a K-type giant star with a stellar classification of K1III: − the colon suffix indicates some uncertainty in the luminosity classification of III. Spectroscopic analysis of the star was used to derive an estimated mass of about 1.81 times the mass of the Sun. It has an estimated age of 1.6 billion years; old enough at that mass to have evolved off the main sequence. As a giant star, the atmosphere has expanded to 7.3 times the Sun's radius, and it is emitting 26 times the solar luminosity at an effective temperature of 4,772 K. The projected rotational velocity of the star is 4.3 km/s, indicating it is rotating with a period of under 86 days.

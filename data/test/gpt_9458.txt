In Vajrayāna Buddhism, esoteric transmission is the highest level of instruction in the dharma, which is given by a guru to his or her qualified disciples.   Esoteric transmission is the term used in Vajrayāna Buddhism for the highest level of instruction in the dharma, which is given by a guru to his or her qualified disciples. The term "esoteric" is derived from the Greek word eso- (in this context meaning "hidden") and -kratia (meaning "power"). It refers to teachings that are kept secret from the general public, and that are only known to those who have been properly initiated into the teaching.  The term "vajrayāna" means "the Vehicle of the Vajras", and refers to the highest form of Buddhism. The vajrayāna teachings emphasize the importance of meditation and concentration techniques, as well as spiritual praxis (the practice of achieving enlightenment). Contrary to mainstream Buddhist teachings, which emphasize individual liberation through understanding and practice of the Four Noble Truths, the vajrayāna teachings promote a more Tantric approach, emphasizing spiritual development through union with divine beings.

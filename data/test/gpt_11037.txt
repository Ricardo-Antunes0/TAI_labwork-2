Greek fire was an incendiary weapon used by the Byzantine Empire and later the Ottoman Empire. The substance was a mixture of tar, naphtha, and quicklime, and was stored in leather tubes or buckets. When ignited, it created a devastating fire that could continue burning even after being water droplets were thrown on it.  Greek fire was most commonly used against Muslim naval ships, as it could not be extinguished by water. It is also reported to have been used against Christian targets, though this is disputed. The use of Greek fire threatened the entire Mediterranean maritime trade, and caused immense damage to both fleets and shore settlements. The Byzantines developed the technology further than the Ottomans, who did not adopt it until the 14th century.

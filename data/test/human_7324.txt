The Kaikadi are a community found in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Traditionally they were nomadic, mainly wandering in the Vidarbha region of the state, but most have now settled down. They face significant oppression and were once called a Criminal Tribe, and so were placed on the list of Denotified Tribes (DNTs) after independence. They speak Kaikadi, a Dravidian language closely related to Tamil with significant Indo-Aryan admixture. Colonial scholars had a significant disdain for the community, with Robert Vane Russell calling them "disreputable" and with "bad morals." Russell claimed their name derived from  (meaning "hand") and  (meaning "basket"), while the community derives its name from  (a stand-in for a name) and  (a type of twig). Russell recorded their occupation as basket-making. Colonial scholars claimed the community arrived from Telangana and they were related to the Yerukala. The community has several endogamous septs: 9 recorded in Vidarbha. They also have a set of exogamous clans: Jadhao Gaikwad, Patke, Mule and Mane. Marriage within the clan is forbidden, as is marriage outside a sept. Kaikadi men can't marry maternal aunt's daughter, although maternal uncle's children are allowed like in most of South India.

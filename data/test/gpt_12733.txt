was a Japanese amateur palaeontologist. When he was just 26 years old, he was the first person to identify a hadrosaurid (duck-billed dinosaur) skeleton from the Jōmon period in Japan.  Okamura was born on October 2, 1967 in Kagoshima, Japan. He first became interested in palaeontology while he was still in high school, and began to study it seriously after graduating from college. In 1991, he made the groundbreaking discovery of a hadrosaurid skeleton from the Jōmon period in Japan, and this led to him becoming one of the leading experts on this group of dinosaurs.  Okamura continued to make significant contributions to palaeontology throughout his career, and his work has helped to firmly establish the Jōmon period as one of the most important periods in Japanese dinosaur history. He was also responsible for co-authoring a book on Japanese dinosaurs with fellow palaeontologist Tetsuo Sakamoto, which was published in 2006. Okamura passed away on September 9, 2016 at the age of 57 after a long battle with cancer.

Cannabidiol-dimethylheptyl (CBD-DMH or DMH-CBD) is a synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist and a potent analgesic. CBD-DMH was first synthesized by scientists at GW Pharmaceuticals in the UK in 2013, and is currently in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of chronic pain. CBD-DMH has a lower affinity for CB1 and CB2 receptors than THC, meaning that it does not produce psychoactive effects.

RoboCop 3 is a 1993 American science fiction action film directed by Fred Dekker and written by Dekker and Frank Miller. It is the sequel to the 1990 film RoboCop 2 and the third entry in the RoboCop franchise. It stars Robert Burke, Nancy Allen and Rip Torn. Set in the near future in a dystopian metropolitan Detroit, Michigan, the plot centers around RoboCop (Burke) as he vows to avenge the death of his partner Anne Lewis (Allen) and save Detroit from falling into chaos, while evil conglomerate OCP, run by its villainous CEO (Torn), advances its tyrannical program to have the city default on its debts. It was filmed in Atlanta, Georgia. Most of the buildings seen in the film were slated for demolition to make way for facilities for the 1996 Summer Olympics that were held in the city. RoboCop 3 is the first film to use digital morphing in more than one scene. The film was a critical failure and performed poorly in the US, grossing $47 million worldwide against its $22 million budget, making it the least profitable film of the RoboCop franchise. The two television series, RoboCop and RoboCop: Prime Directives, were released in 1994 and 2001, while a remake RoboCop was released in 2014.

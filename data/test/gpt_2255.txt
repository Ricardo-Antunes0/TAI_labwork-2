Lysis of Taras (; ; fl. c. 350 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher, mathematician and astronomer.  Born in Taras around 350 BC, Lysis is thought to have been the founder of the school of philosophy known as Pyrrhonism. He is most famous for his work on mathematics, astronomy and philosophy, which influenced the development of Neopythagoreanism. Lysis is also considered one of the earliest exponents of formal mathematics.  Lysis is known to have written several works on mathematics, including On Conoids and Spheroids (c. 340 BC), On Spirals (c. 330 BC), and On Cuboids (c. 320 BC). He also wrote a treatise on astronomy, entitled The Observatory (c. 310 BC). Lysis is credited with developing the first spherical trigonometry and with proposing that the Earth was round rather than flat.

33 Service Battalion is a Canadian Forces Primary Reserve unit with three companies located at the M.L. Troy Armoury in North Bay, Pine Street Armoury in Sault Ste Marie, and the Major Holland Armoury in Ottawa. The battalion is under command of 33 Canadian Brigade Group, itself commanded by the 4th Canadian Division.  The battalion is made up of officers and soldiers primarily from the Royal Canadian Logistics Service and the Royal Canadian Electrical Mechanical Engineering Corps providing transportation, supply, administration, food services, and mechanical support  for providing Combat Service Support to 33 Canadian Brigade Group and other military organizations in eastern and northern Ontario. History  The first reserve service support unit was organized in Ottawa on 1 July 1903 when a 1st Class Stores Section of the Ordnance Corps was established in the Military Stores Building behind Cartier Square Drill Hall.  The unit was composed of members of the Permanent Force and transfers from both the Governor General’s Foot Guards (GGFG) and the 43rd Regiment, Duke of Cornwall’s Own Rifles.  The battalion's lineage from this point forward is complicated by the move from a horse-based military at its origins to the modern mechanized force of today. This has caused the formation of new corps such as the Royal Canadian Electrical Mechanical Engineers (RCEME) to maintain the complex equipment as well as the amalgamation of other corps such as the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps and Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps under the combined Logistics title.

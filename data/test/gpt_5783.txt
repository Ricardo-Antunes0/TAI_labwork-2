D. António Tomás da Guarda Cabreira de Menezes, O.F.M. (23 September 1810, Rio de Janeiro – 25 October 1865, Rio de Janeiro) was a Brazilian Roman Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro from 1861 to 1865.  Cabreira was born in Rio de Janeiro on 23 September 1810, the son of Domingos Cabreira and Francisca Menezes. He studied at the Seminary of Santa Cruz and at the University of Coimbra, where he obtained a doctorate in theology in 1836.  Cabreira was ordained a priest on 8 September 1836. He then served as a chaplain in the royal court and in the army. He was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Olinda on 12 February 1851 and was consecrated on 15 March of that year by António Ribeiro da Silva, Archbishop of Olinda. Cabreira served as Bishop of Olinda until his appointment as Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro on 26 January 1861.  As Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro, Cabreira clashed with Emperor Pedro II over the issue of state funding for the Catholic Church in Brazil. The emperor responded by dismissing Cabreira from his post on 5 May 1865. Cabreira died two months later on 25 October 1865 at the age of 59. He was buried at the Cathedral of São Vicente de Paulo.

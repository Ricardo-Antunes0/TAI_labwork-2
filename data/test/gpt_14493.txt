Alexander Altmann (April 16, 1906 â€“ June 5, 1972) was an Austrian-born American mathematician, known for his work in mathematical physics and mathematics education. Born in Vienna, Austria, Altmann moved with his family to the United States in 1917. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1931 under the direction of Harry Bateman. After a year as a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University, he became an associate professor at Brown University in 1935. In 1945 he moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he served as professor until his retirement in 1969.  Altmann made significant contributions to many areas of mathematics, including functional analysis, Lie theory, the theory of probabilities, and mathematical physics. He also played a leading role in developing mathematical curricula for college students. Altmann was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1961 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965. He died in 1972 at the age of 73.

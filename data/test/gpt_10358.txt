In Greek mythology, Plexippus  or Plexippos (; Ancient Greek: Πλείξιππος) was the son of Sisyphus and Periphetes, and brother of Antiphilus. He was king of Thebes and father of Euryalus.  Plexippus was the son of Sisyphus and Periphetes, and brother of Antiphilus. He was king of Thebes and father of Euryalus. He had a reputation for being both foolish and reckless. For example, he once jumped into a blazing fire to save his brother Antiphilus from being devoured by dogs.  Plexippus is best known for his tragic dispute with Heracles. The two were competing in a race when Plexippus tripped on a rock and fell behind Heracles. Heracles mockingly asked Plexippus how he was going to catch up now, to which Plexippus replied "I will run on foot". Heracles then crushed Plexippus' foot with his sandal, rendering him unable to walk.

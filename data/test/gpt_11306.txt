Hemocyanins (also spelled haemocyanins and abbreviated Hc) are a class of organic compounds that contain a copper atom at the center of a molecule of oxygen. They are responsible for the bright blue color of blood and other tissues, and are also involved in the transport of oxygen throughout the body. Hemocyanins are found in both animal and plant cells and are used to store energy in the form of carbohydrates. Hemocyanins are also used in research into new therapies for diseases such as cancer.

Bahram Mirza  was a Safavid prince, governor of Khorasan, Gilan and Hamadan. He is also known to be a calligrapher, painter, poet, musician and patron of arts. Life  He was born in 1517 to Ismail I and his Turcoman wife Tajlu Khanum in meadows of Surluq near Maragha, a place Ismail loved to spend time as his youngest son. He was a full brother of future shah Tahmasp I. His public service started in 1530 when he was just 13 years old by an appointment to Khorasan governorate with Ghazi Khan Takalu as his guardian or lala with capital province of Herat. This experience proved very hard for the young prince as he had to face Ubaydullah Khan of Shaybanids. However, as soon as Ubaydullah retreated, Tahmasp arrived in Khorasan in 1533 to fight against Uzbeks. Bahram accompanied his brother in central flank in the battle near Jam. However, since Takalu contingents fled from the battle, governorship of Khorasan was revoked from Ghazi Khan Takalu and Bahram Mirza by Tahmasp, who granted it to another brother Sam Mirza.

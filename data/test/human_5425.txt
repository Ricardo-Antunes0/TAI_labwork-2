Owen Wright is an American musician best known for playing guitar with the Seattle-based metal bands Mistrust and My Sister's Machine. Biography In 1984, Wright formed the band Mistrust along with singer Kevin Wells (later replaced by Jeff L'Heureux from Culprit), guitarist Michael Winston, bassist Tim Wolfe, and drummer Chris Gohde. They released an album in 1986 called Spin the World, which brought them opening gigs with Alice Cooper, Stryper, and Loudness. The band continued touring for another two years before they disbanded in 1988.   A year later, Wright and Gohde formed the band My Sister's Machine along with singer-guitarist Nick Pollock and bassist Chris Ivanovich. Pollock had previously played guitar with the band Alice N' Chains, a precursor to Alice in Chains that also featured Layne Staley on vocals. My Sister's Machine recorded two albums, Diva and Wallflower, and toured with other notable acts such as Alice in Chains, Pantera, and White Zombie. Wright is credited for co-writing the music to almost every song in the band's catalog. Although both albums were largely well received by critics, My Sister's Machine split up in 1994 after Elektra Entertainment folded the label they were under at that time.

It was the only integrated public school in Montgomery County, Virginia and served students from pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade.  During its more than eighty-year history, the Lucketts School educated generations of students who went on to achieve great things: lawyers, judges, doctors, teachers, ministers, authors, businesspeople, athletes, and more. Many alumni are still active in their communities today.  We are grateful to the many people who have helped make the Lucketts School a success: the families who donated their time and money to support the school; the community members who volunteered their time; the staff members who dedicated their lives to educating our children; and most importantly, our students themselves. Thank you for sharing your memories of the Lucketts School with us.

Alexis Lemaire (born 1980) is a mental calculation world record holder. He holds a Ph.D in Computer Science related to artificial intelligence from the University of Reims. He is also the owner of world records for mentally calculating the 13th root of 100-digit numbers and 200-digit numbers. On 10 May 2002, he calculated the 13th root of a 100-digit number in 13.55 seconds, beating the record held by Willem Klein (88.8 seconds) and the somewhat less official record of Gert Mittring (39 seconds). On 23 November 2004, Mittring tried to beat Lemaire's record, but his time of 11.8 seconds was not counted as official, as one organization's rules had decided to stop recognizing records for root extraction of random numbers due to the difficulty of standardizing the challenge. Less than a month later (17 December 2004) Lemaire beat his own record, with a time of 3.625 secondsâ€” this included the time it took him to read the number, calculate its root, and recount the answer. He found the 13th root of the 100-digit number  which is 45,792,573.

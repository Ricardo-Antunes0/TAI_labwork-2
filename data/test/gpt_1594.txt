Soft matter or soft condensed matter is a broad family of materials that are not hard solids, and do not typically exhibit the crystalline or amorphous behavior of liquids or gases. It covers a wide range of materials such as plastics, elastomers, foams, gels and pastes, which are often used in various industrial and consumer applications.  Soft matter is subdivided into two main categories: elastomeric and plastic. Elastomeric materials are characterized by their ability to deform under pressure and return to their original shape. Plastic materials, in contrast, do not undergo plastic deformation and are often used in products that need to be durable and resistant to abrasion.   Soft matter is also important for research in fields such as nanotechnology, biomedicine and energy storage.

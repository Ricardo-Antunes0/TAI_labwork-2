The  Kienning Colloquial Romanized Alphabet (建寧府土腔羅馬字, Kienning Fu teo Romanzu) is a romanization system for the Taiwanese Hokkien language, which is mainly spoken in the Kienning County of Taipei City and in some villages of Hsinchu County.  The Kienning Colloquial Romanized alphabet was developed in the early 20th century by a native speaker of Hokkien, Kienning Wu (鄭寧年), who was the director of education in the then-newly created Kienning County. Wu sought to create a romanization system that would be more easily understood by speakers of Hokkien and would not rely on Chinese characters.  Today, the Kienning Colloquial Romanized alphabet is used primarily by speakers of Hokkien who live in the Kienning County area or who are educated in Hokkien and want to learn more about the local language. It is also used by scholars who study Hokkien culture and literature.

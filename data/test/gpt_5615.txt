The MET call (Medical Emergency Team) was created in the early 1990s in response to the emerging problem of increasing medical emergencies and the need for a coordinated response. The MET calls are staffed by specially trained paramedics and emergency medical technicians who are stationed at various medical facilities around the United States.  The MET team is responsible for responding to all types of medical emergencies, including cardiac arrests, car accidents, and shootings. The team is equipped with the latest in medical technology and training and is always ready to help save a life.

Islamic environmentalism is a strand of environmentalism which follows Islamic principles. It emerged in the late 20th century, as Muslim scholars began to create a theology of ecology. Islamic environmentalists seek to emulate Islamic principles in their interactions with the natural world, arguing that this is an integral part of practicing the faith.  Islamic environmentalists believe that humans are part of nature and must respect it. They also believe that the Quran and Sunnah mandate that humans take care of the earth and its resources, and that this is a form of worship. They advocate for environmental protection and sustainable practices, and work to educate Muslims about these issues. Some Islamic environmentalists also work to promote interfaith cooperation on environmental issues.  There is no one definition of Islamic environmentalism, as it reflects the different schools of thought within Islam. Some Islamic environmentalists believe that all forms of religious practice can be used to promote environmentalism, while others focus on Islam as the sole source of guidance for environmentalism. Regardless of this variation, all Islamic environmentalists share a common goal of protecting the earth and its resources from harm.

Meteor Crater, or  Barringer Crater, is a meteorite impact crater about   east of Flagstaff and  west of Winslow in the desert of northern Arizona,  United States. The site had several earlier names, and fragments of the meteorite are officially called the Canyon Diablo Meteorite, after the adjacent Ca√±on Diablo. Because the United States Board on Geographic Names recognizes names of natural features derived from the nearest post office, the feature acquired the name of "Meteor Crater" from the nearby post office named Meteor. Meteor Crater lies at an elevation of  above sea level. It is about  in diameter, some  deep, and is surrounded by a rim that rises  above the surrounding plains. The center of the crater is filled with  of rubble lying above crater bedrock. One of the interesting features of the crater is its squared-off outline, believed to be caused by existing regional jointing (cracks) in the strata at the impact site.

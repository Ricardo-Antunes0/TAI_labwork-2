Eye-rolling is a gesture in which a person throws their eyes back and down in a conveying of boredom, contempt, or exasperation.  The origin of the eye-roll is unknown, but it may have originated from the facial expression of a person who is trying to avoid looking at something unpleasant. Eye-rolling is often used as a form of communication, as it is an outward sign of disapproval. It is also used as a form of self-defense, as it can make someone look more powerful and intimidating.

Tourism projects In 2002, the Hong Kong government announced that the MTR Corporation (MTRC) had secured the rights to run a cable car which formed part of a HK$750 million tourism project scheduled for completion in August 2005. Under the plan, a theme village would be built at Ngong Ping along a 'tourist corridor', with 6,000 square metres of shop space and an 18,600-square-metre piazza between the cable car terminal and the Po Lin Monastery. A 5.5km cable car line, jointly managed by the MTRC and Skyrail-ITM of Australia, would link it to Tung Chung station, in the vicinity of Hong Kong International Airport. Government-funded infrastructure works were estimated to cost $70 million.

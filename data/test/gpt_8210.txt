The 1st Operations Group (1 OG) is a United States Air Force unit. Its primary mission is the conduct of air operations in support of United States national interests.  The 1st Operations Group is a unit of the United States Air Force, stationed at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. It is the USAF's sole operational flying command, and its lineage dates back to World War I as the 1st Aero Squadron. The 1st OG is also the first USAF unit to be assigned to Joint Base Andrews.  The 1st OG's history begins on 17 April 1917 when a detachment of the American Expeditionary Force's 1st Aero Squadron arrived at Saint-Omer, France to support French Army operations. The squadron became part of the 3d Wing on 15 May 1917 and saw combat in World War I flying reconnaissance and escort missions. The squadron was awarded three Croix de Guerre with Palm, four Distinguished Service Crosses, and 25 Silver Stars for its actions in France. After the war, the squadron was demobilized on 28 February 1919 at RFC Le Mans, France.  In 1941, the squadron was reactivated as part of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), being redesignated as the 1st Fighter Squadron on 15 November 1941. The unit served in the Pacific Theater of Operations as part of Twelfth Air Force until it was disbanded on 10 March 1945.  The 1st OG was reactivated as a fighter unit in 1951 when it was assigned to Tactical Air Command (TAC).

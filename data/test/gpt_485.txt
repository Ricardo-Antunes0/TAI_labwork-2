The field of articulatory phonetics is a study of the physical manifestation of speech sounds, their production, and the acoustic properties of speech sounds. It is also concerned with the manner in which speech sounds are combined to form words and phrases.  The articulatory phonetics of a particular language can be studied using a variety of methods, including acoustic analysis, recording and analysis of speech samples, transcription, and analysis of written language. The study of articulatory phonetics has led to the development of methods for improving the accuracy and clarity of pronunciation, as well as for teaching speech recognition and language learning.

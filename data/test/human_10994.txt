Richard Parsons (born 1966) of Broughton-in-Furness, Cumbria, England is a former teacher and the author of a series of best-selling GCSE study guides. In a league table of the top UK authors, by number of books sold, compiled by The Bookseller magazine, for the period 2000-2009, he ranked fifth. Dissatisfied with the quality of study guides during his teaching career at Furness College, Parsons quit in 1995 and began writing his first manuscript, which was later published through his own company, Coordination Group Publications. By the end of 2009, his 600 titles had sold over nine million books grossing over Â£48 million. Though he wrote the original books himself and they all bear his name, later books were written by other teachers. Parsons wrote the motivational book, How to fulfill your wildest dreams!, that was published in 1990, by Mega-Books (Broughton-in-Furness). He also owns a petrol station and leisure centre in Broughton.

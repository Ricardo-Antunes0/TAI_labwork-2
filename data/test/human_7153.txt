New Legends is a 2002 action video game developed by Infinite Machine, a studio founded by former employees of LucasArts, and published by THQ, for the Xbox gaming console. It would be the only game released by the developer, as New Legends was a commercial failure, and Infinite Machine was unable to secure funds to continue development of their next game, Sam & Max Plunge Through Space, also intended to be an Xbox exclusive. Setting and Gameplay The game take place entirely in the country of China. The player controls Sun Soo, a young fighter who is fighting to free China and his kingdom, Soo Kingdom, from the villainous armies of Xao Gon. Throughout the game, players will use both melee weapons and firearms in a thirdâ€“person perspective, while defeating enemies. Soo may hold up to two weapons at once, one in each hand, and can control both separately using the console's "X" and "B" buttons.

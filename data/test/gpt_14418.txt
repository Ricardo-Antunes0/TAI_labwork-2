Stretchable electronics, also known as elastic electronics, are devices that can be stretched or expanded without breaking.  The development of stretchable electronics has the potential to revolutionize many applications, from portable electronics to biomedical implants. The ability to modify and customize devices on the fly opens up a host of new possibilities for technologies and applications.  One of the key challenges facing stretchable electronics is ensuring that the devices remain functional after being stretched or expanded. There are a number of methods that researchers are exploring to address this issue, including using flexible materials and design methods that allow for variable expansion and contraction.

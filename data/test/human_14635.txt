Karen Joy Shaw is an American microbiologist and discoverer of novel antifungal and antibacterial compounds.  She is best known for her work on aminoglycoside resistance in bacteria as well as leading drug discovery research teams. As Senior Vice President of Biology at Trius Therapeutics, Inc. her work was critical to the development of the oxazolidinone antibiotic tedizolid phosphate (Sivextro) as well as the discovery of the TriBE inhibitors, a novel class of DNA gyrase/Topoisomerase IV antibacterial agents that target both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms.[2]  As Chief Scientific Officer at Amplyx Pharmaceuticals, Shaw was responsible for the preclinical development of the novel antifungal fosmanogepix, a first-in-class broad-spectrum antifungal prodrug that is currently in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of invasive fungal infections.  She also discovered APX2039, a unique Gwt1 inhibitor that is in preclinical development for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis. Early life and education  Shaw was born in Brooklyn, New York to Shirley and Solon (née Warshawsky) Shaw, and is the second of two daughters. Shaw graduated from Sheepshead Bay High School in Brooklyn, New York in 1972 and received the Elsbeth Kroeber Memorial Award in Biological Science for outstanding scholarship.  She attended Brooklyn College and received her Bachelor of Science in 1976 from Brooklyn College, CUNY, Brooklyn NY and was awarded the Kappa Phi Club Award from the Department of Biology for an outstanding woman senior.  She went on to do graduate work at University of Connecticut, Storrs in the laboratory of C. M. Berg where she received her master's degree in bacterial genetics in 1978 studying transposon mutagenesis and her doctoral degree in 1981 for studies of metabolic pathways in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli.  She was awarded a Damon Runyon-Walter Winchell postdoctoral fellowship to support her studies on yeast genetics. at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO in the laboratory of Maynard V.

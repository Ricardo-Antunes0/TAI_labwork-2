Phil Kelly (Artist)  (1950â€“2010)  was an Irish expressionist painter who became a Mexican citizen in 1999. Biography Phil Kelly was brought up in England with strong influences from his Irish ancestry. He was educated at Rugby School and studied Art and Special Education at college in Bath. On leaving college he lived in London, Portugal and then in Whitby, North Yorkshire, all with fellow artist Ann Woods, seeking to establish himself as a painter while earning money through a variety of jobs including van driving, farmwork and teaching. From 1974 to 1981, he exhibited his work in small galleries wherever he lived, some in Portugal, some in the UK. In 1982 he made his first visit to Mexico and a new chapter in his life began. Until now his paintings were influenced by such artists as Freud, Auerbach and Jack Yeats and by the landscape and colours of Northern Europe. Now the colour and light of Mexico brought a new dimension to his work. He stayed for three years and by chance was out of the country when the Mexican earthquake devastated the apartment where he lived, killing his partner Blanca. Kelly returned to London, working where he could, usually teaching and exhibiting in several small London galleries, these were often one-man shows.

The Young Companion, known as Liángyǒu  zhùyì (令狐珠), was a Chinese encyclopedia edited by Zhu Xi and published in 1268–1271. It was the first encyclopedia ever created, and is also considered one of the most influential texts in Chinese classical learning.  The Young Companion was conceived in the early 1260s, when Zhu Xi was in his early thirties and serving as tutor to the young future emperor Gaozong of China. The encyclopedia was intended as a comprehensive resource for students of all levels of learning, from the scholarly elites to the common people. It consisted of around 10,000 entries, nearly half of which were new inventions or modifications of existing concepts.  The Young Companion had a profound impact on subsequent encyclopedias and educational texts in China and East Asia. Its systematic approach to learning and its emphasis on critical thinking have been highly influential in East Asian thought and education. The encyclopedia also had a significant impact on Chinese poetry, prose, painting, calligraphy, and architecture.

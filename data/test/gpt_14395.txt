Oxycodone, sold under the brand names Roxicodone, Oxycontin, and Percocet, is a narcotic medication used to treat moderate to severe pain. It is a Schedule II controlled substance in the United States, meaning that it has a high potential for abuse and is subject to criminal penalties.  Oxycodone was first developed in the early 1960s as a general anesthetic. It was not approved for use in the United States until 1985, and was not available in generic form until 1996. Oxycodone is now one of the most commonly prescribed medications in the world. It is available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, dissolvable tablets, and injectable solutions.

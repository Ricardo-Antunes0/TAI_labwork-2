Astley Bridge Mill or Holden Mill is a former cotton mill in the district of Astley Bridge in  Bolton, Greater Manchester, England which has since been converted into an apartment building. Constructed in 1926 for Sir John Holden & Sons Ltd, it was the last cotton mill to be built in Bolton and is a Grade II listed building. Architecture Designed by the local architectural company of Bradshaw, Gass and Hope, the building has five storeys and a basement, with a typical rectangular floor plan of 14 by 6 bays and a flat concrete roof. The internal structure is made of steel and concrete, faced in brick with red terracotta detailing in a restrained Art Deco style. At one corner is a stair tower with a domed copper roof; projections at other corners carry services between floors. It was designed from the outset to use electricity from the local power station, one of the earliest mills to do so, and thus had no large boiler house and stack, although conventional heating boilers and chimneys were required for heating purposes.

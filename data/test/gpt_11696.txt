Saint Rudesind  (November 26, 907 – November 30, 953) was a Frankish bishop and abbot.  Rudesind was born in the Auvergne area of central France in 907. He studied at the Benedictine monastery of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris, where he became a monk under the guidance of Saint Odilon. He was ordained a priest in 924, and soon thereafter left Paris to serve as the abbot of Luxeuil Abbey.  In 941, Rudesind was elected Archbishop of Reims by the Synod of Rheims. He served in that position for twenty-four years, during which time he helped to solidify the power of the archbishopric and to improve relations between the Church and the Frankish monarchy. In 953, he resigned his post as Archbishop and retired to Luxeuil Abbey. He died there two years later, on November 30.  Rudesind is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church, and is considered one of the most important figures in medieval French history. He is also honored by the Orthodox Church, where he is known as Rudesindios.

Heugel was a French music publishing company, active from the late 18th century until the early 20th century.  Heugel was founded in 1768 by Antoine-Joseph Heugel and operated until 1904, when it was bought by Jacques Masius.  The company published a wide range of music, including sacred choral works, operas, ballets, and instrumental pieces. Many famous composers worked for Heugel, including Jean-Philippe Rameau, Antonio Vivaldi, Georg Philipp Telemann, and Ludwig van Beethoven.

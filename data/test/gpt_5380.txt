Uveitis–Glaucoma–Hyphaema (UGH) syndrome also known as Ellingson syndrome, is a rare, inherited eye disease that may lead to glaucoma and/or hyphema. The syndrome results from mutations in the gene encoding the protein uveitis-associated transcript 1 (UTA1). UTA1 is a key regulator of uveitis development and is also implicated in the pathogenesis of glaucoma.

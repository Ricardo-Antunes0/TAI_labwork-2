John Wilson Candler (February 10, 1828 â€“ May 3, 1892) was an American businessman who became the president of Coca-Cola, the world's most popular soft drink.  Candler was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, to Wilson Candler and his wife Elizabeth. He attended Wake Forest University but left after a year to join his father's business in Charleston, South Carolina. After a few years he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where he ran a successful liquor store. In 1856, he opened a soda fountain in Atlanta called "The Fountain of the World." The success of this venture convinced him to start manufacturing and selling Coca-Cola.  Candler was very successful in business and became one of the wealthiest men in the United States. He served as the president of Coca-Cola from 1879 until his death in 1892. He is buried at Westview Cemetery in Atlanta.

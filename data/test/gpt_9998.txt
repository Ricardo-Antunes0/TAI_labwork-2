Lawrence Goldman  (born 17 June 1957) is a British-born American mathematician, Fields Medalist and Abel Prize Laureate.  Goldman was born on 17 June 1957 in London, England. He is the son of mathematician Rose (née Rosenfeld) and physicist Abraham Goldman. He was educated at the University of Oxford, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics in 1980. He then attended Harvard University, where he received his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1985 under the guidance of Saul Kripke.  After completing his doctorate, Goldman joined the faculty of Princeton University in 1985 as an assistant professor. He was promoted to full professor there in 1998, and became the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Professor of Mathematics in 2006.  Goldman's research focuses on the theory of operator algebras and symplectic geometry. He has made significant contributions to the theory of Lie groups, spectral theory of operators, modular invariance, and Lie algebras over finite fields. In 2001 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and he has been a fellow of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the British Academy since 2002.  He was awarded the Fields Medal in 2002, together with Jürgen Schmidhuber and Shing-Tung Yau. The three were recognized for their work on symplectic geometry and its applications to quantum field theory. In 2006 he was awarded the Abel Prize, which is awarded by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters

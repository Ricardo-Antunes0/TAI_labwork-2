Saint Philip's Seminary is an apostolate of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri, a Catholic society of apostolic life. It has been authorized to grant degrees by the province of Ontario. It accepts students for the priesthood who are sponsored by their diocese or by their religious order. History The Philosophy Division of Saint Philip's Seminary was founded in 1986. Gerald Emmett Cardinal Carter requested to provide a place for the philosophical preparation of seminarians for the Archdiocese of Toronto, especially those in residence at Serra House, the archdiocesan house of discernment. In the fall of 1988, a residential program providing intellectual training, spiritual and personal formation was made available to seminarians from Dioceses and Religious Communities. In 2007, a three-year course of studies with an expanded set of degrees was provided at the request of the Archdiocese of Toronto and St. Augustine's Seminary. The Congregation for Education in January 2011 instituted the three-year course of philosophical studies as the norm for seminarians.

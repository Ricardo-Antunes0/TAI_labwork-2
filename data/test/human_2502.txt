Harriet Merrill Johnson (born 1886 in Bangor, Maine), graduated from the Massachusetts Homeopathic Hospital and began working as a district nurse at the Henry Street Settlement. While working as a district nurse, Johnson became interested in the needs of children. She, Lucy Sprague Mitchell, and Caroline Pratt formed the Bureau of Education Experiments in 1916, now known as Bank Street College of Education. Their aim was to bring various specialists and researchers together for the purposes of studying experimental education. Johnson was the founder and first director of the bureau's nursery school, which was later named in her honor. This nursery school was the direct predecessor to Bank Street's School for Children, a private elementary school operating under the college's umbrella.        Johnson was the author of several texts on education: The Visiting Teacher (1916) A Nursery School Experiment: Descriptive Report (1924) Children in Nursery School (1928)  The Art of Block Building (1933)  School Begins at Two: A Book for Teachers and Parents (1936) Harriet Johnson Nursery School

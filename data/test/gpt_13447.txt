In international relations, migration diplomacy is 'the use of migration to influence the decision making of other states'. It is a 'negotiation and implementation of policies designed to manage international migrant populations'. It can take various forms, including:   - Migration assistance programmes, which provide financial and humanitarian assistance to migrants and refugees;  - Development assistance, which supports the development of countries that are hosting large migrant populations;  - Advocacy work, which seeks to change public opinion about migrants and refugees in order to improve their rights and opportunities;  - Policy coordination and facilitation, which help to create a policy environment that facilitates migration and refugee flows.

Malala-Ambilikala Lagoons  are two interconnected coastal lagoons located in the northern part of the island of Madagascar. The lagoons are separated by a narrow isthmus and are about 2 kilometers long and 1 kilometer wide on average.   The lagoons are fed by the Malala River, which flows into them from the east. They are home to a variety of aquatic and migratory birds, including flamingos and herons.

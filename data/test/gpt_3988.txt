In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Adrasteia (; Ancient Greek: Ἀδραστεία) was a goddess of beauty and love. She was the daughter of Ares, god of war, and Aphrodite, the goddess of love. Adrasteia was usually depicted as a comely young woman with long flowing hair, wearing a garland of flowers or a crown of myrtle.  The name Adrasteia derives from the ancient Greek words Ἀδραστής (adrastēs), meaning "a person who shows activity", and εἰς (eis), meaning "into". Thus, she was the person who enacted or carried out beauty and love within the community. As Aphrodite's daughter, she was also known as the goddess of love and beauty.

Seri Iskandar (Jawi: سري إسكندر, ) is a town and district capital of Perak Tengah in Perak, Malaysia. It is located at about 40 km southwest of Ipoh on the main Ipoh-Lumut highway. The adjacent towns are Tronoh, a once-famous mining town and Bota. Universiti Teknologi Petronas, a branch campus of Universiti Teknologi MARA and Kolej Profesional MARA are located in Seri Iskandar. History  The town was named after Paduka Seri Sultan Iskandar Shah, who ruled the state of Perak from 1918 until 1938. Several institutions started the township in the mid-eighties before it got its name. The Engineering Branch Campus of Universiti Sains Malaysia started its operation on a disused tin mine at about 5 km south of Tronoh in 1986. A religious secondary school, SMKA Sultan Azlan Shah, occupied a newly built school buildings at about 7 km east of Bota Kanan in 1987. A radio transmission station and a teachers living quarters were built soon after within this area. In 1988, the state government came out with a plan of a township with its own name. A large industrial park, a university with commercial parks and housing estates with an airport were parts of the plan of the township. However, progress was slow and the investors were slow to come in. The eastern part of Seri Iskandar was an extension of Tronoh Mines prior to the 1980s. In the early 1990s, USM Engineering Campus was surrounded by disused mining pools. Except for a school, palm oil plantations covered the western part at this time. To travel from Tronoh to Bota, one must go through Seputih and Parit, to reach Bota.

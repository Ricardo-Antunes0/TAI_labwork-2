Robert Kay (1728â€“1802) was an English inventor, best known for his development of the portable steam engine.  Born in 1728, Kay was apprenticed to a shoemaker, but found his true passion in inventing. In 1759 he created the first portable steam engine, which allowed for easier transport and production of goods. Kay's engine was a significant improvement on earlier models, and helped spur the Industrial Revolution. He died in 1802, but his work continues to be used today.

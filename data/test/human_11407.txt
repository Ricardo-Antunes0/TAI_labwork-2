Joël Cloarec (born 5 February 1966) is a French football manager and former player who is the head coach of French club La Vitréenne. As a player, he was a forward. Club career  Cloarec made his first steps as a pro with Concarneau in 1984. He would go on to play for the club until 1986, when he joined fellow Breton club Brest. In 1991, Cloarec left Brest to sign for Châteauroux, where he would spend a season before joining Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). At PSG, he was a victim of tough competition, and he only played one minute the entire season, as he was substituted on for David Ginola during a 2–1 Division 1 victory away to Saint-Étienne on 8 August 1992. He holds the record for the shortest amount of time played for PSG. After the end of the 1992–93 season, Cloarec was sent out on loan to Valenciennes, where he played 38 league games in the Division 2. Following his loan stint, he returned to Paris, but the PSG manager at the time, Artur Jorge, decided not to keep him; therefore, he returned to his native Brittany to play for Guingamp.

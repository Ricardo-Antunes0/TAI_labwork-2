The Finnish Democratic Republic ( or Suomen demokraattinen valtio; Finnish: Suomen demokraattinen rikspoliisi, SDP) was a sovereign state in Northern Europe during the Cold War. The republic was founded on 7 November 1918 after the Russian Revolution of 1917. Finland became a republic in 1919. The first president was Eero Kilpi.   The Finnish Democratic Republic was originally conceived as an interim measure to secure Finland's independence from Russia while the country worked to create a stable, democratic government. The Finnish Civil War of 1918â€“1921, fought between the pro-independence Finnish White Army and the pro-Russian Red Army, resulted in the defeat of the Whites and their withdrawal from political life. After losing a war and being forced into exile, the Reds were able to return to Finland in 1944 and establish a one-party dictatorship. In 1955, the Stalinist regime was replaced by a more liberal one, and in 1956 Finland became a member of the United Nations. In 1975, after years of economic stagnation and increasing dissatisfaction with the status quo, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) won the parliamentary election and began implementing market-based reforms. In 1983, Finland joined the European Economic Community (EEC), which helped spur economic growth. In 1991, following the Soviet Union's dissolution, Finland re-established its independence and adopted a new constitution.

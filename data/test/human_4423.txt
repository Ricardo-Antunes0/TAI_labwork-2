The Leyland Landtrain was a truck that was produced in the 1980s by British Leyland. Designed for the export markets in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, it was particularly popular in Nigeria, Kenya and Zimbabwe. The Landtrain was designed to be used in areas of limited infrastructure, where roads may be rough and fuel scarce. It was powered by four different engines and produced with three different gross vehicle weights (GVW), ,  and   The Landtrain was produced as both a two-axle 4x2 and a three-axle 6x4 rigid and a 6x4 tractor. The truck was produced in the Leyland plant in Wolverhampton between 1980 and 1982, when production moved to Bathgate, and then finally to Watford in 1984. Kits were exported from these plants to Leyland factories in Ibadan, Nigeria, and Thika, Kenya, where they were assembled. The truck ceased production in 1987 after the merger of Leyland with the Dutch company DAF.

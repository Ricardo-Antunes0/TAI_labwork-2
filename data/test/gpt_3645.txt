Gurie Grosu (; born 1 January 1877 in Bucharest, Romania, died 23 October 1950 in Bucharest) was a Romanian physicist and mathematician who made significant contributions to the theory of waves and optics.  Gurie Grosu was born on 1 January 1877 in Bucharest, Romania. He studied mathematics and physics at the University of Bucharest, where he received his doctorate in 1903. From 1903 to 1906, he worked as a professor at the University of Bucharest. In 1906, he moved to Paris, France, where he worked as a professor at the Sorbonne University from 1906 to 1920. From 1920 to 1930, he served as the president of the Romanian Academy. He returned to Romania in 1930 and died there on 23 October 1950.  Gurie Grosu made significant contributions to the theory of waves and optics. His work on wave properties of light led him to develop the theory of diffraction and interference. He also developed the theory of optical coherence, which is used today in optical communications and laser technology.

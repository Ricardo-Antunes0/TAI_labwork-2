Chinese Filipinos (sometimes referred to in the Philippines as "Tagalog Chinese", "Filipino Chinese", or simply "Chinese") are people of Han Chinese descent who reside in the Philippines. They form one of the largest minority groups in the Philippines, numbering around 2 million people.  The arrival of Chinese traders and immigrants to the Philippines can be traced back to the 14th century, when the Ming Dynasty established trading posts in the country. The first large wave of Chinese immigrants came in the late 1800s, when many were recruited as laborers to work on the country's extensive railway network. The second wave of Chinese immigrants arrived in the early 1960s, when many were fleeing political and economic turmoil in their home countries.  Today, Chinese Filipinos are a well-integrated minority group, with a rich culture and history. They play an important role in Filipino society, economy and politics.

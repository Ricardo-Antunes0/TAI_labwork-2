Pete Moore (20 August 1924 – 1 December 2013) was a British composer and arranger for a string of famous artistes from the 1950s onwards. Born in Essex, England, Moore studied composition and arranging privately for approximately ten years with three teachers. These were Alfred Nieman (who was on the staff at the Guildhall School of Music, London), Henry Geehl and a certain "Dr. Cook" who was probably another staff member at one of the London music colleges. Beginning in 1958, he worked with such greats as Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Peggy Lee, Frankie Laine, Connie Francis and Peter Sellers, amongst others, on all manner of broadcasts and recordings. He frequently collaborated with record producer Ken Barnes.  As a composer, he wrote themes for many TV commercials, including such famous brands as Coca-Cola and Lux Toilet Soap, in addition to numerous songs recorded by such artists as Crosby, Lee, Laine and Astaire. However, it is his composition "Asteroid" – the famous theme for Pearl & Dean's cinema advertisements – that remains his most familiar and most successful composition. Apart from being heard every day on cinema screens in the UK, it is constantly featured around the world in commercials and documentaries. For many people, the very sound of its "pa-papa-pa" fanfare spells "cinema". It has also been sampled by modern-day pop artists and enjoyed chart success on more than one occasion. Pearl & Dean's signature tune is one of the most famous tracks played in British movie houses.

Hiroshima mon amour , the literal English translation of which is "Hiroshima, My Love" (the Japanese title is 二十四時間の情事 (romanized: Nijūyojikan'nojōji), which translates as "Twenty-four-hour affair"), is a 1959 French New Wave romantic drama film directed by French film director Alain Resnais and with a screenplay by French author Marguerite Duras. Resnais' first feature-length work, it was a co-production between France and Japan, and documents a series of intensely personal conversations (or one long conversation) over slightly more than a 24-hour period between an unnamed French actress and Japanese architect. The film is notable for Resnais' innovative use of brief flashbacks to suggest flashes of memory, which create a nonlinear storyline. Along with films like Breathless and The 400 Blows, Hiroshima mon amour brought international attention to the new movement in French cinema and is widely considered to be one of the most influential films of the French New Wave. In particular, it was a major catalyst for Left Bank Cinema.

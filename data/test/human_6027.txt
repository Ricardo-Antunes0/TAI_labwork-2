The Pascal Paoli is a RoPax ferry owned and operated by SNCM. She was the last ferry built by the Van der Giessen de Noord yard. On January 5, 2016, Pascal Paoli was transferred to the Maritime Corse Méditerranée, a new entity succeeding SNCM following its takeover by the Corsican businessman Patrick Rocca. On February 3, after a technical stop at the Tunisian yards of Menzel Bourguiba, the ship arrived in Marseilles without any commercial markings. At the end of May 2016, the ship received the red livery of Corsica Linea, the trademark of the Corsican consortium Corsica Maritima which merged with the MCM. The ship departed Marseille for Bastia on May 25, 2016, for its first voyage under its new colors. Name The ship is named after Filippo Antonio Pasquale de' Paoli (6 April 1725 – 5 February 1807), a Corsican patriot, statesman and military leader who was at the forefront of resistance movements against the Genoese and later French rule in Crsica. He became the president of the Executive Council of the General Diet of the People of Corsica, and also designed and wrote the Constitution of the state.

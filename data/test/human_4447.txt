KLIN had its antecedents in Fremont, Nebraska, where the AM station on 1400 kHz was originally authorized in 1940, with the call letters KORN. The station was sold to Inland Broadcasting in 1947. In connection with the acquisition, the FCC authorized Inland to relocate the station to Lincoln and change the call sign to KOLN, and also to build a new station on 1340 kHz at Fremont, to become KORN. KOLN began broadcasting August 11, 1947, as a Mutual affiliate on 1400 kHz with 250 Watts of power. Studios were in the New Federal Securities Building in Lincoln.

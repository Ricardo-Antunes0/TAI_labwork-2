Hondurans (Spanish: Hondureñas or Hondureños) are the citizens of Honduras. Hondurans are people of mixed race that descend from the Spanish people, mainly from Andalusians, Galicians, Valencians, Catalans, Canaries, Extremadurans and in a minority with other peoples of present-day Spain and various tribes and ethnic groups of indigenous peoples that belonged to Mesoamerica such as the Mayas and Lencas, as well as Afro-Caribbean peoples. In some areas of the country, the mestizo would be with other European peoples such as the English, Italians, French, Jews, and other ethnic groups such as Arabs. With the founding of the modern nation of Honduras, which occurred in 1821 and did not include the entire Spanish-German-speaking territory, the term Hondurans also came to designate the residents of this nation. Within "modern Honduras", Germans as well as all immigrants or descendants of non-Hispanic immigrants in this sense have been defined by their Honduran citizenship. Most Hondurans live in Honduras, although there is also a significant Honduran diaspora, particularly in the United States, Spain, and many smaller communities in other countries around the world. There are also people living in Honduras who are not Hondurans, because they were not born or raised in Honduras, nor have they yet gained citizenship.

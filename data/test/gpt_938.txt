Operation Karbala-4 was an Iranian offensive in the Iraqi province of Diyala that started on 16 October 2016. The offensive was part of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) planned series of military operations in Iraq.  The objective of the operation is to recapture the city of Samarra, which has been under control of Sunni militants since June 2014. The city is significant because it is home to the al-Askari Mosque, a revered Shi'ite site.  The IRGC has stated that the operation will last for six months and will involve around 50,000 Iranian troops.

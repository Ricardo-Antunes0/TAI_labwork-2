English Garden, released in North America as Bruce Woolley and The Camera Club, is a studio album by Bruce Woolley and his new wave band The Camera Club. The band consisted of Woolley on vocals, Matthew Seligman on bass, Rod Johnson on drums, Dave Birch on guitar, and Thomas Dolby on keyboards.  Before forming the group, Woolley was creating pop songs intended for publishing companies, but he was not happy with what the artists were doing with his songs and decided to write material for himself. Recorded at Eden Studios in London, English Garden was released in most territories by Epic Records, while in North America the album was distributed by CBS Records. Singles from English Garden included the title track, "Video Killed the Radio Star", "Clean, Clean" and "Dancing With The Sporting Boys". Most reviews of English Garden were very positive, one reviewer even calling it ahead of other releases in its genre.

The 2018 Nidahas Trophy was a cricket tournament that was held in Sri Lanka in March 2018. It was a tri-nation series between Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka. Each team played each other twice, with two teams progressing to the final. The tournament was played to celebrate Sri Lanka's 70th year of independence; the title derives from the Sinhalese නිදහස් nidahas, meaning "freedom." Sri Lanka Cricket confirmed that the matches would be played as Twenty20 International fixtures. The fixtures and venue were announced in November 2017, with all the matches played at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. This was the first occasion that Discovery Networks Asia Pacific channel DSport acquired media rights to broadcast live cricket matches involving the Indian cricket team. The opening match of the tournament, between Sri Lanka and India, was held under tight security following the a state of emergency in Sri Lanka. It was imposed by Sri Lanka's government following the violence between Muslims and Sinhalese Buddhists in areas such as Ampara and Kandy.

Eusthenodon (Greek for “strong-tooth” – eustheno- meaning “strong” andodon meaning “tooth”) is an extinct genus of herbivorous mammal that lived during the Pliocene epoch. The genus is composed of a single species, Eusthenodon mirus, which was first described by John Edward Gray in 1825.  Eusthenodon was a small animal, measuring only about 1.5 metres (4.9 feet) long and weighing around 25 kilograms (55 pounds). It had a short trunk and short, powerful limbs, which gave it a relatively slow gait. The fur on its body was long and coarse, and it possessed a pair of sharp incisors in its jaw. Eusthenodon probably lived in forests, scavenging fallen fruit and other food sources.

Later, the Inn became a hotel and apartment building, before falling into disrepair. The structure that formerly housed the Inn was purchased by the Wyandot County Historical Society in 1964. Over the course of three years, the building was restored to its stage coach days, and was soon dedicated as a stagecoach museum. It is one of only two original stagecoach inns remaining in the state.

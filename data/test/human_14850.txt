Menti nostrae is an apostolic exhortation of Pope Pius XII on the sanctity of priestly life, given in Rome at St. Peter's on September 23, 1950, in the 12th year of his pontificate.  Menti nostrae has four parts, addressing the sanctity of priestly life, the sanctity of priestly service, practical regulations and special difficulties of priestly life. Priestly life means first of all the imitation of the life of Christ, according to the Pontiff. This is especially important in a modern world, which so many are confused by conflicting even anti-Christian messages. Imitation of Christ means an inner relation with Christ, full observance of celibacy and a separation from earthly goods.  The priest participates in Holy Mass on the sacrifice of Christ and in his mystical death and resurrection. Great emphasis is put on the prayer life of the priests. The Liturgy of the hours is of prime importance as is daily contemplation, private prayers, his frequent confession and spiritual guidance through an experienced priest of his confidence.

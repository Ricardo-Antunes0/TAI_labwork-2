Channelling is the process that constrains the flow of energy within a physical system. It can be used to control and manipulate the energy within a system, by allowing certain parts of the system to access more energy than others. Channelling can be used to create or destroy energy, or to change the direction or flow of energy within a system.  Channelling is a commonly used technique in physics and engineering, for controlling the flow of energy within systems. It can be used to create or destroy energy, or to change the direction or flow of energy within a system. Channelling can be used to create or destroy matter, or to change the speed, direction, or intensity of energy flow. Channelling can also be used to control the temperature or pressure of a system.

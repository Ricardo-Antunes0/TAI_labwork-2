Diogenes of Apollonia ( ; ;  â€“ c. 320 BC) was a Greek philosopher and Cynic philosopher who lived in the 3rd century BC. He is considered one of the most influential thinkers of the ancient world.  Diogenes was born in Apollonia, in the eastern part of the Ionian Islands, then part of the Republic of Venice. He was a student of Crates of Thebes and he succeeded his teacher as head of the school in which he had been taught. He traveled extensively, preaching Cynicism in Athens and Megara, and also in Corinth, Thebes, and Cyrene. He is said to have lived an ascetic life, eating only what could be found lying about on the ground or thrown away by others.  Diogenes is remembered for his eccentric behavior and for his startling claims about himself. He said that he could walk on water and that he could turn any man into a dog by holding him by the ears. According to legend, Diogenes became so famous that he was invited to court by Alexander the Great. However, when Alexander asked him how he could be so wise if he did not even eat bread, Diogenes replied that he ate no bread because he knew that bread is made from flour and therefore belonged to the class of things that must be earned with labor.  Diogenes is also credited with being the first person to propose using canals as a form of public transportation.

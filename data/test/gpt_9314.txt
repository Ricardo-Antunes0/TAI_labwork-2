Nabozny v. Podlesny, 92 F.3d 446 (7th Cir. 1996), is a U.S. case law decision that held that the use of a racially derogatory term in a speech is not protected by the First Amendment.   The plaintiff, Nabozny, is a black man who was allegedly the victim of a hate crime in which he was called a nigger by one of the defendants, Podlesny. Nabozny sued Podlesny, alleging that the use of the term constituted criminal harassment under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1985(3). The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Podlesny on the ground that there was no provable racial motivation behind the attack, and therefore no actionable harassment. The Seventh Circuit affirmed on appeal.  The court found that there was no protection for speech that is racially derogatory because it has nothing to do with any political ideas or beliefs. The court stated: "There can be no doubt that racist speech is vile and repugnant. It is also unprotected by the First Amendment."

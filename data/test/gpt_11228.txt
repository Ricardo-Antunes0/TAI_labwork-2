Anthony Bryan Hayward (born 21 May 1957) is an English businessman. He is the former CEO of British Petroleum ( BP ), the second largest oil company in the world. He resigned from his post on 15 July 2010, after a series of revelations about the company's Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  Hayward was born to a working-class family in Bournemouth, Dorset. He attended Bournemouth School and then read economics at Downing College, Cambridge, graduating with a first class honours degree in 1979.  Hayward started his career as an economist at BP's regional headquarters in London. In 1988, he was appointed head of refining and marketing for BP North America. He was promoted to vice president for exploration and production in 1995, and became president of BP Exploration and Production in 1998. In 2003, he was appointed CEO of BP UK.  During his tenure as CEO of BP, Hayward presided over the company's merger with Amoco in 1998, its purchase of TNK-BP in 2007, and its acquisition of ARCO in 2008. These transactions made BP one of the world's largest oil companies. Hayward also oversaw BP's $54 billion investment in new production capacity worldwide during his time as CEO.  In July 2010, Hayward resigned from his post at BP following revelations about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The spill occurred on 20 May 2010 and resulted in the death of 11 workers and extensive environmental damage; it was the largest accidental marine oil spill in history.

The Ovche Pole Offensive Operation  was a military operation of the Axis Powers in World War II. The offensive was launched on 8 July 1944, against the Soviet defenses of the Oder River near the town of Ovče Pole, east of Berlin. The offensive failed to achieve its objectives and resulted in a large number of casualties on both sides.  The offensive was planned as an attempt to break through the Soviet lines and reach Berlin, which had been declared to be an "unassailable fortress" by Adolf Hitler. The offensive was preceded by a six-week long German assault on the Soviet positions around Kraków, which was also unsuccessful. The high casualties suffered by both sides during the operation led to its eventual cancellation on 26 September 1944.

Interstate 481 (I-481) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway in the United States. It runs from I-40 in Tupelo, Mississippi to I-10 in Memphis, Tennessee. It is maintained by the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) and is a part of the National Highway System.  The freeway starts at an interchange with I-40 in Tupelo, heading northeast as a four-lane expressway. The freeway enters Pike County and has an interchange with US 59/US 78/US 82. The freeway enters Lauderdale County and has an interchange with US 41/SR 7. The freeway crosses the Mississippi River into Memphis and has an interchange with I-10. I-481 ends at this interchange.  I-481 was designated on July 1, 1970 as an east–west route to supplement US 61/US 491 and US 61/US 491A, which were concurrent through Tupelo. The route followed what is now I-40 from Tupelo to Jackson, then turned northeast onto what is now I-10. Between 1972 and 1974, I-481 was extended northwest to its current endpoint at I-10 in Memphis; this extension was originally planned to end at US 51, but MDOT relented and allowed for the extra mile.

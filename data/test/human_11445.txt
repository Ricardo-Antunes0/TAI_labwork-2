Veronica Porumbacu (pen name of Veronica Schwefelberg; October 24, 1921 – March 4, 1977) was a Romanian poet, prose writer and translator. Born into a Jewish family in Bucharest, her parents were Arnold Schwefelberg and his wife Betty (née Grünbaun). Until age seven, she was cared for by a nanny from Porumbacu de Sus village; this was the origin of her pen name. She studied at Elena Doamna High School from 1932 to 1940, during which time she became a communist activist. Upon graduating, she was unable to enroll in the University of Bucharest due to anti-Jewish laws, instead attending the private College for Jewish Students in 1943–1944. She subsequently attended the literature faculty of the University of Bucharest from 1944 to 1948. She was a schoolteacher in 1943, a reporter and editor at the Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company from 1945 to 1949, editor and then assistant editor-in-chief at Viața Românească from 1949 to 1953, assistant editor-in-chief at Gazeta literară from 1953 to 1956 and section chief at the Romanian Writers' Union from 1956 to 1964. From 1970, she taught at the Bucharest Pioneers' Palace.

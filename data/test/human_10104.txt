The Kosovo–Serbia land swap is a proposed territorial exchange between Serbia and the partially recognized state of Kosovo to make their border run along ethnic lines. Initially rejected by the international community, the little progress made by the European Union-backed Belgrade–Pristina negotiations has brought the idea into greater consideration in the EU and also in the United States. The territorial exchange is generally discussed to involve a transfer of the Preševo Valley of Serbia with an ethnic Albanian majority to Kosovo and the pass of the majority ethnic Serb region of North Kosovo of Kosovo to Serbia. The cession of the Serbian municipality of Medvedja to Kosovo has also been proposed. This municipality, although with a considerable Albanian minority, is predominantly ethnic Serbian. A territorial exchange between Kosovo and Serbia has been proposed to potentially solve the current political status in the region that has stayed stagnant ever since Kosovo's independence declaration in 2008 in order to facilitate the accession of Kosovo and Serbia into the EU. This could also lead to a complete normalization of the relations between Kosovo and Serbia and a potential accession of Kosovo into the United Nations (UN).

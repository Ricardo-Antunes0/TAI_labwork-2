History Břetislav Novotný was one of the best known car designers in the country, previously designed both the  Novo and  Omega prototype before working with Zbrojovka Brno which produced cars under the brand name Disk. He departed from the company in 1925 and moved to Prague to construct his own car. From 1926 to 1927, he started designing a prototype at the workshop of the Varvařovský company in the Holešovice district. He moved onto another company, Košař with the body being produced in the Kobylisy district. Novotný and Košař were joined by Frantisek Kolanda, son of a Prague printing family and was in charge of the commercial affairs. With now enough funding, the company moved to a new location over at the Karlín district. The company was then renamed to Frantisek Kolanda a spol., tovarna na automobily. The brand name Enka (also spelled as EnKa and ENKA) was made by combining phonetic initials of Novotný and Kolanda.

The Mark 15 torpedo, the standard American torpedo of World War II, was a more powerful and sophisticated version of the Mark 14 torpedo. It was first deployed in 1943 and was used extensively in the Pacific Theater of Operations. The torpedo had a longer range than the Mark 14 and could reach targets at greater depths.

The Bonneville Expedition was a military operation undertaken by the United States Army in 1857, during the American Civil War.  The expedition was led by Captain John C. Fr√©mont, who was commissioned by the United States government to explore the Great Basin and then report back on its resources and potential for military use. The expedition reached the southern end of the Great Basin on July 24, 1857, and then traveled northwards to explore the Columbia River. On December 24, 1857, they reached the Columbia River's mouth and returned to California.  The expedition was a significant achievement for the United States military; it demonstrated that the Great Basin could be crossed and that the Columbia River could be explored. It also provided valuable information about the Great Basin and the Columbia River system that was used by later military expeditions.

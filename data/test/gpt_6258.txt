The British Empire was composed of the possessions and dominions of the United Kingdom, which at its height covered a quarter of the world's land area and was the largest empire in history. The British Empire originated from the colonial expansion of the early 18th century, which led to the present-day nations of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and numerous other territories throughout the world. The British Empire was marked by a number of important developments in political, social, economic, and military affairs.

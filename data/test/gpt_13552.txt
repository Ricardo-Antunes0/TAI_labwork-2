Burton Manor is a former manor house on the outskirts of Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, England. It is now a constituent part of the University of Chester.  The manor was built in the early 16th century for Sir Thomas Blount, Sheriff of Staffordshire. It remained in the Blount family until 1598, when it was sold to Sir John Willoughby. Willoughby was a favourite of Queen Elizabeth I and served as treasurer of England and Lord Deputy of Ireland. He died at Burton Manor in 1635 and is buried in the church there.  The manor passed through several other hands before being acquired by the University of Chester in 1892. The manor house and its grounds are now used for academic purposes, including the University's School of Social Sciences and International Studies and its law school.

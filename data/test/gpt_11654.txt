Terceira  is a volcanic island in the Azores archipelago, located about halfway between the mainland of Portugal and the island of SÃ£o Miguel. The island is home to a population of about 1,500 people.  The name Terceira is of uncertain origin. One theory suggests that it may be derived from the Latin tertius meaning "third", while another suggests that it may come from the Arabic word terekh meaning "island".  The island was first inhabited in the 6th century BC by the Guanches, an indigenous people who were later replaced by the Portuguese in the early 12th century AD. Terceira remained under Portuguese rule until the early 18th century, when it was ceded to Spain as part of the Treaty of Paris following the War of Spanish Succession. In 1809, following Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, British forces occupied Terceira and declared it part of the United Kingdom. Under British rule, Terceira experienced a rapid economic expansion, with new settlements being established on the island and its agricultural sector becoming increasingly mechanized. The island became part of Portugal in 1881 following its independence from Britain, and during World War II it was used as a base by Allied forces operating in Europe. In 2002, Terceira was designated an Autonomous Region of Portugal.

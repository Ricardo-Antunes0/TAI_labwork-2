Neurostimulation is the purposeful modulation of the brain's electrical activity. The term can refer to any technique used to alter the brain's electrical state, including electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and magnetic stimulation (MS).  Neurostimulation is an emerging field of medical treatment that is being explored for a variety of indications, including depression, anxiety, chronic pain, and epilepsy. There are a variety of neurostimulation therapies available, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. Due to the wide range of potential applications and the lack of definitive evidence for many treatments, neurostimulation is currently considered an experimental treatment.  Although neurostimulation has been used for centuries in traditional medicine, it has only recently been investigated as a potential treatment for mental disorders. In 2012, the first clinical trial using neurostimulation to treat depression was published in the journal "JAMA Psychiatry". Since then, neurostimulation has been studied in a number of other trials targeting different mental disorders, with promising results.  Despite the promising early results, there are still many unanswered questions about the use of neurostimulation therapy. For example, it is not clear which patients are best suited for treatment with neurostimulation, or which types of neurostimulation are most effective. Further research is needed to determine the long-term safety and effectiveness of these treatments.

Elbira Zipitria Irastorza (1906–1982) was an innovative Spanish-Basque educator who pioneered home schools as a means of reviving use of the Basque language at a time when it was prohibited. On returning to San Sebastián after the Spanish Civil War she taught young children in their own homes before creating the first ikastola or home Basque-language school in 1956. In the 1960s, 71 schools were created in the towns and cities of the Spanish Basque Country although they were still illegal. It was not until 1970 that official permission was granted for the opening of the Orixe Ikastola in San Sebastián. Zipitria was a member of various political and cultural organizations, including Emakume Abertzale Batza, Euskaltzaleak and Eusko Ikaskuntza. Biography Born in Zumaia on 28 May 1906, she was brought up in San Sebastián. When she was 16, she began a four-year course of teacher-training studies, graduating in 1926. Her first job was at San Sebastián's Koruko Andre Mariaren Ikastetxea school where she taught six-year-olds. In addition to teaching, she took an interest in political and cultural affairs, joining the women's branch of the Basque Nationalist Party where she became secretary in 1934, the Euskaltzaleak Basque Action Organization and Eusko Ikaskuntza, the Basque Studies Society.

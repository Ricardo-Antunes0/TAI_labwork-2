Lund Observatory is the official English name for the publicly owned Observatory of Lund University in Sweden. The observatory is located on the university campus in Lund, about 25 kilometres north of Lund city centre.  Lund Observatory was founded in 1774 by Count Carl Gustaf Armfelt with the help of a donation from King George III of Great Britain. It is the oldest operating astronomical observatory in Sweden and the third oldest in Europe after the Vatican Observatory and Paris Observatory. The observatory has played an important role in astronomy, particularly during the 19th century when it played a leading role in the development of modern astrophysics. It has been used by astronomers to measure distances to galaxies, to study variable stars, and to determine the size and shape of the universe.  Today, Lund Observatory operates three telescopes: The 60-cm Ritchey-Chr√©tien telescope, The 80-cm reflector telescope, and The 120-cm reflector telescope. The observatory also operates a number of auxiliary telescopes, including a 60-cm aperture transit telescope and a small amateur telescope. The observatory is open to the public every day except Christmas Day. Admission is free for visitors who are at least 14 years old.

Built in 1845-6, the existing stone structure is the oldest surviving church building in the state of Oklahoma and the oldest church congregation among the Choctaw nation. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History The congregation was established in 1832, and the current stone church building was constructed in 1845â€“1846 with a cemetery established across the road. Buried in the cemetery is Alfred Wright, a physician and missionary to the Choctaw Native Americans.  Wright translated many books into the Choctaw language, including the New Testament. Until the church building was completed, the services were held outdoors under a large oak tree. The congregation sat on logs placed in rows under the tree. Rev. Wright used an overturned 100-gallon barrel as his pulpit. He preached his first sermon there on December 9, 1832.

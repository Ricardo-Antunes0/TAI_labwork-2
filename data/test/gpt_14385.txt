Sebastian Bodinus (c. 1700 – 19 March 1672) was a German philosopher and Presbyterian theologian who is best known for his work on the philosophy of religion.  Bodinus was born in Bremen, Germany, in 1700. He studied theology at the University of Rostock and then theology, philosophy, and mathematics at the University of Utrecht. He became a Presbyterian minister in 1638 and a professor of theology at the University of Helmstedt in 1642. In 1648 he became pastor of the Reformed Church in Düsseldorf. Bodinus died in Düsseldorf in 1672.  Bodinus's main philosophical work is "Theologiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica" (1663), which synthesizes Aristotelian and Christian doctrines of nature.

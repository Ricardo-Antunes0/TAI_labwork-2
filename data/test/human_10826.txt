Oscar Charlie is a 13-episode CBBC children's television series that aired for the first time on 26 September 2001. The series is about a boy, Charlie Spinner (Eddie Cooper), who discovers that his grandfather, Oscar Spinner (David Swift), is actually a secret agent. He acts as if he is senile but it is just a cover so that nobody would notice. After Charlie confronts Oscar with this they work together on a dangerous assignment. Plot summary  It doesn't go really well with Oscar Spinner, the father of the twelve-year-old Charlie. Grandpa Oscar regularly forgets his own name and the names of others. He burns his food and lets his bath overflow. So Charlie does not look forward to the family visits with grandpa. But during the stay with his grandfather, Charlie discovered a number of things which are not at all consistent with the picture of the demented grandfather. Oscar appears to solve the most difficult crossword riddles with ease; and in his coat, Charlie finds a super-modern personal digital assistant. When he confronts his grandfather with that, he tells Charlie the truth: Oscar is a secret agent for the British secret service MI5 for more than 30 years. For security reasons he has always kept this a secret for his family. But now that Charlie knows, he asks Charlie to help him with a dangerous and super-secret mission: Operation Bear Trap (Episodes 1 to 7). And this way the old and young Spinner join their strengths in the fight against the international crime and espionage.  The second case (Episodes 8 to 13) appears at first glance to be about industrial espionage but it emerges that it in fact involves blackmail of the British Government by an unexpected person who kidnaps Oscar and tries to recruit him.

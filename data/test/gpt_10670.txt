In the United States, Black Identity Extremists (BIE) are a loosely organized group of individuals who have a strong belief in black separatism or self-reliance. They may or may not advocate violence to achieve their goals.  The roots of BIE can be traced back to the early 1990s, when some black nationalist leaders began to emerge. These leaders advocated for the creation of an all-black nation or for the separation of black Americans from the rest of society. Some of these leaders, such as Louis Farrakhan and Al Sharpton, have been controversial figures and have been accused of promoting violence and racism.  Since the early 2000s, BIE activity has increased. This is likely due to the growing concern over race relations in the United States and the increasing number of black Americans who identify as political radicals. Some estimates suggest that there are between 100 and 500 BIE members in the United States, although there is no accurate count because many members are secretive.  BIE activities can take many forms, including rallies and speeches advocating for black separatism and violent protests against white people and institutions. Some BIE members have also been known to commit crimes, such as assault and murder. In general, BIE members share a number of common beliefs, including a distrust of white people and a belief that black people are victims of racism and discrimination.

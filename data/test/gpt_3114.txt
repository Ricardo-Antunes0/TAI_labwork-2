Roots of Resistance was an anti-racist organization started in the early 1980s in Toronto, Canada. It was one of the first grassroots organizations to work to create an anti-racist community within Toronto.  Roots of Resistance was founded in the early 1980s by a group of individuals who were discontent with the way racism was portrayed and experienced in their city. They believed that it was important for people of colour to come together and build their own grassroots organization that could fight against racism on a local level.  Roots of Resistance has been instrumental in organizing numerous anti-racist events and campaigns over the years. These have included protests against racist graffiti, rallies against hate crimes, and educational programs aimed at preventing racism from spreading.  The organization has also worked to build solidarity between different communities of colour, working to create a more equitable society where everyone is treated fairly. Roots of Resistance is an important part of Toronto's history, and its work continues to play an important role in fighting racism and promoting equality.

Karel Bernard Boedijn (29 June 1893 â€“ 25 September 1967) was a Dutch mathematician, who is best known for his work in functional analysis and semigroup theory.  Karel Bernard Boedijn was born on 29 June 1893 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. He died on 25 September 1967 in The Hague, Netherlands.  Boedijn received his undergraduate degree from the University of Amsterdam in 1914 and his graduate degree from the University of Zurich in 1917. He served in the Dutch army during World War I and was wounded in 1916. After the war, he returned to the University of Amsterdam where he began teaching mathematics.  In 1926, Boedijn became a professor at the University of Amsterdam and remained there until his retirement in 1958. He was a member of several professional organizations, including the American Mathematical Society and the Royal Dutch Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Boedijn's research focused on functional analysis and semigroup theory. His most famous work is probably his book Semigroup Theory (1939). In this book, he introduced the notion of a semigroupoid, which has become a fundamental tool in functional analysis. He also made important contributions to the theory of operators on semigroups and to the calculus of variations.

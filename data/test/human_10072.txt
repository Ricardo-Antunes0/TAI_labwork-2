Plot Three sisters, Sachi Kouda, Yoshino Kouda and Chika Kouda, live in the house of their grandparents in Kamakura. Their parents are divorced. One day, they receive news of the death of their father whom they have not seen in fifteen years. At the funeral, they meet their half-sister Suzu Asano. Suzu is living with her stepmother and stepbrother. Observing the behaviour of the stepmother at the funeral (she tries to pass on the responsibility of addressing the guests to Suzu), Sachi guesses that Suzu looked after their father as he died, not the stepmother. At the train station Sachi spontaneously invites Suzu to come and live with them. Suzu joins the local football team and becomes popular as the relationship develops.

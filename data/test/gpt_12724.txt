The Guns for Antigua scandal was a political scandal in Antigua and Barbuda that began in 2004 and involved the alleged bribery of a cabinet minister by businessman, Jack Warner.  The scandal led to the resignation of the then-prime minister, Lester Bird, and the imprisonment of Warner. The investigation later revealed that other high-ranking government officials were also implicated in the affair.

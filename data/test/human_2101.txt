History Georg Thieme Verlag was founded in 1886 in Leipzig, Germany, by Georg Thieme when he was 26 years old. Thieme remains privately held and family-owned. The company received some early success in 1896 by publishing Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen's famous picture of his wife's hand in what is still one of Thieme's  and  Germany's oldest journals, the Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift. In 1919, Georg Thieme partnered with Bruno Hauff, a young publisher from Leipzig. When Thieme died in 1925, ownership of the company passed to Hauff. Members of the Hauff family have been the proprietors of the business ever since.

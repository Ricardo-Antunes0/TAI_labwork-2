Torch River is a river in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The river's source is the dam at Candle Lake, near Candle Lake Provincial Park, and it travels east through boreal forest and muskeg en route to its mouth in the Saskatchewan River Delta. Torch River Provincial Forest, a conservation area, is located along the course of the river, near where White Fox River flows into Torch River. Torch River is a significant tributary of the Saskatchewan River and it is part of the Hudson Bay drainage basin. Description  The Torch River is a tributary of the Saskatchewan River and it flows into one of North America's largest inland fresh water deltas, the Saskatchewan River Delta. The river begins at the south-east corner of Candle Lake from a dam at Hanson Bay near Minowakaw Beach Campground in the RM of Paddockwood No. 520. The dam is a 3.1-metre high concrete dam that was constructed in 1978â€“1979 and is operated by the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority. Less than a mile after the river starts, it crosses Highway 120, leaves the RM of Paddockwood, and enters the RM of Torch River No. 488.

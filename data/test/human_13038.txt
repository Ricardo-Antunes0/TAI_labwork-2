Kaleil Isaza Tuzman is a former entrepreneur associated with digital media, who spent more than 20 years in that industry before being convicted of multiple counts of fraud in 2017. Tuzman started his career at Goldman Sachs, was co-founder of GovWorks.com (the subject of the 2001 documentary Startup.com, which followed the company from its founding to its bankruptcy), served as President of JumpTV, and then as chief executive officer and chairman of KIT Digital, Inc. On September 7, 2015, he was arrested in Colombia and held in a Bogot√° prison until being extradited to the United States to face charges of fraud and market manipulation in connection with the defrauding of investors in KIT Digital and two investment funds. He was convicted on all counts in December 2017. Entrepreneurial life Tuzman started at Brown University and transferred to Harvard starting his sophomore year. After graduating from Harvard University, Tuzman worked for five years at Goldman Sachs, before launching govWorks, Inc., an Internet startup, along with his childhood friend Tom Herman. As the company's CEO, Tuzman raised $60 million in venture capital. Following the burst of the "dot-com bubble" govWorks was sold to First Data Corp. for nearly $12 million, which did not cover the over $35 million in debt. The journey from the company's founding to its sale was chronicled in a documentary Startup.com (2001), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2001.

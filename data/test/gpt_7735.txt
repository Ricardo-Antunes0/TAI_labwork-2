The Cobalt Cafe was an all-ages music venue in the Queen West district of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The club was located at 141 Queen Street West.  The Cobalt Cafe was opened in 1992 by then-owners Michael and Denise Chalifoux. The venue played host to a wide range of music genres, including punk, metal, emo, indie rock and more. In 2006, the Chalifouxs sold the club to new owners. In 2012, the Cobalt Cafe closed its doors for good after a lengthy battle with the City of Toronto over noise complaints.

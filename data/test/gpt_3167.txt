The righting reflex, also known as the otolith reflex, is a reflex that helps an organism maintain its balance. It is a response to a sensed change in the orientation of the body or head. The reflex causes the head and neck to move in the opposite direction of the stimulus.  When an individual is suddenly displaced from their equilibrium, their head and neck will automatically respond by moving in the opposite direction of the displacement. This response is known as the righting reflex and it helps to restore balance and keep the individual from being thrown off their feet.  The righting reflex is a vital mechanism that helps us stay upright and stable. When we are suddenly displaced from our equilibrium, our head and neck will automatically move in the opposite direction of the stimulus in order to restore balance and keep us from being thrown off our feet. This reflex is an important part of our overall balance and safety, and it can be seen in animals ranging from spiders to humans.

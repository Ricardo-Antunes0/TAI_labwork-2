Impurity is the second studio album by Fleshcrawl. It was released on June 2, 2009 through Relapse Records.  The album was recorded in 2008 at producer Jack Endino's (Soundgarden, Nirvana, Pearl Jam) home studio in Seattle, Washington. The album was described by frontman J.D. Brown as "a swirling, chaotic and spiritual journey through the darkest parts of the human psyche."  The album has been described by Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia as "more consistent" than their debut release, but with "even more dark and aggressive" songs. Rivadavia also noted the band's "expansive use of sound" on the album.  All songs written by J.D. Brown, except where noted.

After completing her apprenticeship as a house painter, she studied at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf from 1893 to 1897. During this time she met Arnold Böcklin and other members of the Düsseldorf School of painting, which greatly influenced her work.  In 1898 she moved to Berlin, where she joined the Freie Kunstverein (Free Art Association). She exhibited her work with this organization from 1901 to 1906. In 1907 she moved to Munich, where she became a member of the Secession and exhibited with them from 1908 to 1910.  From 1911 to 1913 Kähler lived in Vienna, where she joined the Wiener Werkstätte (Vienna Workshop). She also exhibited her work with this organization from 1912 to 1916. After returning to Berlin in 1916, she continued to exhibit her work with various organizations until her death in 1955.

Robert B. Scott (January 23, 1845 â€“ November 9, 1912) was an American explorer who led three expeditions to the Antarctic. He also made important contributions to atmospheric science and is best known for his discovery of the Antarctic ice sheet.  Robert B. Scott was born in Franklin, Massachusetts, on January 23, 1845. After graduating from high school in 1859, Scott worked as a teacher and surveyor in the Boston area. In 1873, he joined the US Army as a lieutenant and participated in the American Expedition to the Far East.  Scott became interested in exploring Antarctica after reading reports of an 1820 British expedition that had failed to find a route through the continent. In 1880, he led an expedition that discovered the South Pole and became the first person to reach it. The following year, he led another expedition that discovered the Antarctic ice sheet.  Scott retired from military service in 1888 and began working as a professor of geography at Harvard University. He also served as president of the American Geographical Society and founded the Scott Polar Research Institute. He died on November 9, 1912, after a long illness.

Vladimir Laxa (; 21 January 1870 – 1945) was a Croatian general who served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I and in the Croatian Home Guard during World War II. During World War II, he was Army Chief of Staff of the Axis puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH), from June 1941 until August 1942, when he resigned his commission purportedly in protest of the atrocities committed by the Ustaše Militia. Laxa was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Army on 18 August 1890. During the First World War he was commander of the 18th Mountain Brigade, and was one of only 131 men  who were awarded the Military Order of Maria Theresa, the highest Habsburg decoration; in Laxa's case for the “heroism, enormous bravery, and tenaciously successful defence of positions” by himself and his men on Škabrijel (Italian: Mount Saint Gabriel) during the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo in 1917. After the war ended, he joined the newly formed army of (what became known later as) the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

Panorama Film Studios, sometimes referred to as Hollyburn Film Studios, was a two sound stage and projection/dubbing theater complex constructed circa 1960 in the lower foothills of Hollyburn Mountain at West Vancouver, British Columbia. It was financed with help from UK investor(s) including Lord Folkestone, hence the name of the paved private road that ran from the Upper Levels Highway (Trans-Canada Highway 1) to the large studio parking lot. The studio address was 2280 Folkestone Way. Dirt mountain roads led from behind the studio up the side of Hollyburn mountain, at the time totally pristine tree-covered land. The building was eventually demolished and today the area is residential. Construction The studio consisted of two buildings: a large concrete block/poured cement structure consisting of two large soundstages, two floors of offices and dressing rooms. There was also a large projection room/dubbing stage plus projection booth, 35Â mm sound equipment machine rooms and four large editing rooms. The sound equipment installation, primarily supplied by RCA, was designed by Howard Tremaine, author of the famed Audio Cyclopedia, who moved from Hollywood to live in Sunset Beach/Lions Bay area just northwest of the studio. Previously Tremaine had worked at the USAF's Lookout Mountain Film Studio and also owned and operated the private film technology school University of Hollywood.

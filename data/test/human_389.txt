Radiosynthesis is a  fully automated synthesis method in which radioactive compounds are produced. Radiosynthesis is generally carried out by several nuclear interface modules, which are protected by the lead shielding and controlled by a computer semi-automatically. The set-ups of  modules are different depending on the type of product and synthesis process. Consequently, the modules should be adapted with the synthesis stages. In some cases, such stages of synthesis  are carried out manually in order to optimize the radiochemical yield or due to the incompatibility or lack of module. Module Radiosynthesis modules consist of following constant components: Reservoir: To store reactants Pipe : To link all components together Valve : To manage the flow of liquids Reactor : To proceed the reaction(s) Temperature and Radioactivity sensor : To adjust and measure the temperature and radioactivity Preparative HPLC : To purify the Product There are also some components which are added based on the synthesis set-up such as stirrers, sterile filters, Sep-Paksâ„¢, vials, bottles, detectors etc..

Anand  is the administrative centre of Anand District in the Gujarat state of western India. The city is situated on the banks of the Sabarmati River, about 130 kilometres from Ahmedabad, the state's capital. The district has an area of 11,711 square kilometres and a population of 1,692,160.  Anand was originally known as "Vadodara" and was founded in 1497 by Rao Anandji, a merchant from the city of Surat in Gujarat. Rao Anandji chose the site because the Sabarmati River provided a natural defence against attack. The city grew rapidly and by 1592 it had become an important commercial centre. Anand was ruled by a succession of Muslim rulers until it was conquered by the Mughals in 1612. It remained part of the Mughal Empire until its collapse in 1818.  The British took control of Anand in 1819 and it became part of the Bombay Presidency. In 1907 Anand became part of the new state of Gujarat and in 1960 it became the administrative centre of Anand District.  Anand is an important cultural and commercial centre and is home to several universities, including the Gujarat Technological University, which was founded in 1960. The city is also home to several industrial areas, including a pharmaceuticals plant and a sugar mill.

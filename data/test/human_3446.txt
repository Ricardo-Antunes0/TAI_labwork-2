Patrick Hepburn (1487 – 20 June 1573) was a 16th-century Scottish prelate. He was born in East Lothian, went to St Andrews University, entered the church, and then exploited his family connections to become Prior of St Andrews and royal secretary. Hepburn moved on to become Bishop of Moray and Commendator of Scone and played an ambiguous role in the Scottish Reformation.  During this time he held a notorious reputation for immorality. He was deprived of his ecclesiastical titles two years before his death in 1573. Early life and career Born to Patrick Hepburn of Beinstoun and Christian née Ogilvie in 1487, he entered the college now known as St Mary's College, St Andrews - then called simply "The Pedagogy" - in 1509. After graduating, he chose an ecclesiastical career and became parson of Whitsome from 1521. On 10 June 1524 Patrick, as a secular clerk, was appointed by Pope Clement VII as coadjutor to his uncle John Hepburn, Prior of St Andrews. This meant he would assist his aged uncle as prior and succeed him as commendator when he died. The coadjutorship gave Patrick a seat in parliament, which he took up in 1525; he became secretary of King James V of Scotland, a position he held between March 1525 and through to June 1526. Patrick succeeded his uncle when the latter died on 15 January 1526.

Victor Arkhipovich Ivanoff (Виктор Архипович Иванов, 2 September 1868 – 13 December 1932) was a Russian composer and pianist.  Ivanoff was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia into a musical family. His father, Arkhip Ivanoff, was a music teacher and composer who, according to some sources, taught his son the basics of classical music at an early age. Ivanoff studied at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory with Anton Rubinstein and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and won first prize in 1888. He then toured Europe extensively, performing as a pianist and composer. In 1904 he settled in Paris, where he died thirteen years later.  Ivanoff's compositions include chamber music, orchestral works, songs, and piano solos. He is perhaps best known for his piano trios (the most famous of which is the Trio for Piano, Violin and Cello), which are highly virtuosic and often showcase his strong compositional skills. Ivanoff also wrote several ballet scores, including The Firebird (1910), Swan Lake (1919), and The Nutcracker (1892).

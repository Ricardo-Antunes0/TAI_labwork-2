In planetary science, the term unusual minor planet refers to a minor planet that does not fall into one of the traditional categories, such as a planet, comet, or asteroid.  The Minor Planet Center (MPC) defines an unusual minor planet as "a minor planet that has not been observed or catalogued by the Minor Planet Center and that is not a member of any known asteroid family." An example is 1979 FD, which was first observed by Japanese astronomers in 1979 but was not recognised as a minor planet by the MPC until 2002.

El Hassan El-Abbassi (born 13 April 1984) is a Moroccan-born long-distance runner who competes internationally for Bahrain. He was the gold medallist in the 10,000 metres at the 2014 Asian Games and the 2015 Asian Athletics Championships. He has a personal best of 27:25.02 minutes for that distance. Career El-Abbassi initially ran in middle-distance events but a move up to longer distances brought him his first successes. In his debut over the distance, he set a personal best of 62:53 minutes at the 2011 Marrakesh Half Marathon. His first race abroad followed in February and he was the surprise winner at the  Eurocross cross country meet. An outing at the Corrida de Langueux 10K run brought him fourth place. He had three further outings over the half marathon distance that year and was in the top three each time: he was runner-up in Zwolle, set a personal best of 61:13 minutes for third at the Route du Vin Half Marathon, and was under 62 minutes again to win at the Zhuhai Half Marathon in China that December. He failed to progress much further in 2012, with a podium finish at the Yangzhou Half Marathon and fourth at the Philadelphia Distance Run being his best races abroad. However, he did win his first national title over 10,000 metres with a personal best time of 28:12.40 minutes.

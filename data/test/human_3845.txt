Theodor Schieffer (11 June 1910 in Bad Godesberg – 9 April 1992 in Bad Godesberg) was a German historian. He was professor of medieval history at the University of Mainz, then at the University of Cologne, and since 1952 he was president of the Association for Middle Rhine Church History. He is the author of Winfrid-Bonifatius und die christliche Grundlegung Europas, the authoritative biography of Saint Boniface. Biography Schieffer studied history, Romance studies, and classical philology in Bonn, Berlin, and Paris. A member of the Katholischer Studentenverein Arminia Bonn, one of Germany's oldest Catholic student societies, he wrote his PhD dissertation under the direction of Wilhelm Levison, Die päpstlichen Legaten in Frankreich vom Vertrage von Meersen (870) bis zum Schisma von 1130 (1934). In 1935 he began to work for the Monumenta Germaniae Historica (MGH), where he edited the Diplomata editions on Lothair I, Lothair II of Lotharingia, Zwentibold, Louis the Child, and the Burgundian kings. In 1936, he published an essay on Alexis de Tocqueville in the Munich-based Catholic periodical Hochland, founded by Carl Muth. The essay, in its discussion of liberty, justice, and law, was a veiled critique of Nazi Germany; in the "remarkable" essay he cites de Tocqueville, "I have always loved liberty; all my thoughts lead me to the conviction that without it there can be no moral or political greatness." During World War II Schieffer worked as archivist in Paris.

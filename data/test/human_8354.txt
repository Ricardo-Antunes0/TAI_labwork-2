As in other Polynesian islands, Rapa Nui tattooing had a fundamentally spiritual connotation. In some cases the tattoos were considered a receptor for divine strength or mana. They were manifestations of the Rapa Nui culture. Priests, warriors and chiefs had more tattoos than the rest of the population, as a symbol of their hierarchy. Both men and women were tattooed to represent their social class. The tattooing process was performed with bone needles and combs called uhi or iuhi made out of bird or fish bones. The ink was made out of natural products, primarily from the burning of Ti leaves (Cordyline terminalis) and sugar cane. These needles resemble a small comb with sharp and skinny prongs. The bones come from birds, fish or hen. The other end has two grooves so that a rod can be attached to the end, which probably helps the artist maneuver the needles during the tattoo process. Tattoos are applied with the needle combs and a wooden mallet called miro pua â€˜uhi.

Sinuessa  was a city of Latium, in the more extended sense of the name, situated on the Tyrrhenian Sea, about 10Â km north of the mouth of the Volturno River (the ancient Vulturnus). It was on the line of the Via Appia, and was the last place where that great highroad touched on the sea-coast. The ruins of the city are located in the modern-day municipality of Mondragone, Campania, Italy. History It is certain that Sinuessa was not an ancient city; indeed there is no trace of the existence of an Italic town on the spot before the foundation of the Roman colony. Some authors mention an obscure tradition that there had previously been a Greek city on the spot called "Sinope"; but little value can be attached to this statement. It is certain that if it ever existed, it had wholly disappeared, and the site was included in the territory of the Ausonian. The cities belonging to the league were Ausona, Vescia, Minturnae, Sinuessa and Suessa. However, there are various controversies about location and belonging.

William Leonard Laurence (March 7, 1888 â€“ October 25, 1961) was an American jurist who served as a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from May 29, 1939, to his death.  Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Laurence received an A.B. from Harvard College in 1910 and an LL.B. from Yale Law School in 1912. He was a law clerk to Judge Learned Hand of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 1912 to 1914 and to Justice Joseph P. Bradley of the United States Supreme Court from 1914 to 1916. He was a partner in the law firm of McKenna, Long & Aldrich from 1916 to 1939, when he was appointed to the United States Supreme Court by Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Laurence served on the Supreme Court for more than 19 years, becoming one of its most influential members. He is perhaps best known for his work on constitutional law, constitutional interpretation, and civil liberties. He was an outspoken advocate for civil rights and (along with Justice Felix Frankfurter) one of the key architects of the New Deal legislation in the 1930s.  Laurence died at age 78 after a long illness following a heart attack on October 25, 1961. He had been scheduled to retire from the court in January 1962 but continued to work until his death. His papers are housed at Columbia University School of Law Library.

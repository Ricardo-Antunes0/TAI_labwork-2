"He's a Liar" was the first single from the Bee Gees album Living Eyes released on 19 September 1981. It had been approximately two years since the last Bee Gees single had been released. The song was written by brothers Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb. Information Unlike the last three Bee Gees albums – which included primarily their established, longstanding studio and touring band – "He's a Liar" features an array of studio musicians: Don Felder of Eagles on lead guitars; Harold Cowart on bass; Steve Gadd on drums; and Richard Tee on piano. A version with a slightly longer intro was released as a 12-inch single in Germany and later on the Japan only compilation Rare Collection. It was recorded between the months of February and June 1981. This song is rumored to have been inspired by the feud the Bee Gees were having with their record manager, Robert Stigwood, at the time. The brothers would later reconcile with Stigwood and remain good friends.

The Bakossi Forest Reserve is a  reserve within the Bakossi Mountains in Cameroon, home to many rare species of plants, animals and birds. The Forest Reserve in turn contains the Bakossi National Park, created by a decree in early 2008. The park covers , and was justified on the basis of preserving plant diversification. The Bakossi Mountains, which include Mount Kupe, cover in total about , with perhaps the largest area of cloud forest in West-Central Africa. They are part of a larger tract of forest that extends northward into the western foothills of the Bamboutos Mountains. The reserve was created in 1956. In 2000, the main section of the reserve was designated a protection forest. All logging was banned and Kupe became a "strict nature reserve". The local Bakossi people participated in delineating the boundaries. Between 2003 and 2007, the effectiveness of management in this and other parks improved greatly, although the local people were not well integrated into the system, and lacked education and awareness of environmental goals.

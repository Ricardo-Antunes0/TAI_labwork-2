The Sheikh Jarrah controversy, which has been ongoing since the 1980s, is a political dispute over the ownership of land in the Palestinian neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem.  The controversy centres on the ownership of three parcels of land – two of which are owned by the Israeli government and one by an Israeli settler – that were sold by the Jordanian government in 1954 to a group of Palestinian families. The families have maintained that they have owned the land since before the establishment of Israel, while Israeli authorities and some Israeli settlers insist that the land was purchased by the Israeli government from Jews who fled Arab countries in 1948.  The dispute has been a major obstacle to the resumption of peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine, and has been the subject of several lawsuits.

Pachamanca (from Quechua pacha "earth", manka "pot") is an ancient Inca technique for weathering and stabilizing hillsides. It is a system of terraces, dykes, and reservoirs that collect and hold water to moderate soil erosion. Pachamanca is most commonly seen in the Andes, but is also present in other mountainous regions around the world.

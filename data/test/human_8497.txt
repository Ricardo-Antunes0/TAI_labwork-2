Gingko is a UK-based charitable foundation created in 2014 to promote dialogue and understanding with the Middle East, West Asia and North Africa through conferences, publications, events and cultural programmes. It should not be confused with Gingko Press, which is a publisher originally based in Germany. Gingko was established in memory of Werner Mark Linz, the late publisher of the American University in Cairo Press. Dr Barbara Schwepcke, Chief Executive and founder of Gingko, explained that Linz '… always thought big. So it is not surprising that his last plan was a 10-year project of dialogues to preserve and promote the genius of Arab Civilization.'. The inaugural Gingko conference was held at SOAS in December 2014. There have since been conferences at the British Academy in London, in Berlin at the Barenboim–Said Academy, and in 2017 at the London School of Economics. It also has a long-standing postgraduate fellowship programme with Al-Azhar University in Cairo.

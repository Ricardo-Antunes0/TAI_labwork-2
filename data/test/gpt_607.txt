Yu Hsi (born Hung Ching Yu) (born December 10, 1912 â€“ October 5, 2000) was a Chinese-American mathematician and scientist. He is best known for his work in abstract algebra, ring theory, and mathematical physics.  Yu Hsi was born in 1912 in Shanghai, China. He attended the University of Michigan where he obtained his B.A. in 1932 and his M.A. in 1933. He then went to the University of Berlin to study under Erhard Schmidt and received his doctorate in 1936. After returning to the United States, he became an instructor at Brown University in 1939 and a full professor at Rutgers University in 1954. In 1960 he moved to Stanford University where he remained until his retirement in 1987.  Yu Hsi was a major figure in mathematics and physical sciences during the middle of the twentieth century. His work included concepts such as automorphism groups, Lie groups, integrable systems, and mathematical physics. He was also an important figure in the development of abstract algebra and ring theory, two key areas of mathematics.

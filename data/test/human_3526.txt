The Dingling  were ancient people who lived in Siberia, mentioned in Chinese historiography in the context of the 1st century BCE.  They are assumed to have been related to Na-Dené and Yeniseian speakers, to be early Proto-Turkic people or ancestors of Tungusic speakers among the Shiwei. They originally lived on the bank of the Lena River in the area west of Lake Baikal, gradually moving southward to Mongolia and northern China. They were a huge independent horde for centuries, but were later defeated and temporarily became subject of the Xiongnu Empire, and thus presumably related to the invaders known as Huns in the west. Around the 3rd century they were assimilated into the Tiele, also named Di (翟), Dili (狄历), Gaoche (高車) or Chile (敕勒), who gradually expanded westward into Central Asia. Some, known as the West Dingling, remained in an area that would become Kazakhstan, while others – expelled from Mongolia by the Rouran – settled in the Tarim Basin during the 5th century and took control of Turpan.

Protoheme IX farnesyltransferase, mitochondrial is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the COX10 gene. Cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, catalyzes the electron transfer from reduced cytochrome c to oxygen. This component is a heteromeric complex consisting of 3 catalytic subunits encoded by mitochondrial genes and multiple structural subunits encoded by nuclear genes. The mitochondrially-encoded subunits function in electron transfer, and the nuclear-encoded subunits may function in the regulation and assembly of the complex. This nuclear gene, COX10, encodes heme A: farnesyltransferase, which is not a structural subunit but required for the expression of functional COX and functions in the maturation of the heme A prosthetic group of COX. A gene mutation, which results in the substitution of a lysine for an asparagine (N204K), is identified to be responsible for cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. In addition, this gene is disrupted in patients with CMT1A (Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A) duplication and with HNPP (hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies) deletion. Structure  The COX10 gene is located on the p arm of chromosome 17 in position 12 and spans 139,277 base pairs. The gene produces a 48.9 kDa protein composed of 443 amino acids. This gene has an unusually long 3' untranslated region measuring 1426 base pairs, compared to a 1329 base pair open reading frame. The COX10 gene has 7 exons totaling 135 kilobases in length. This protein is predicted to contain 7-9 transmembrane domains localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane. There are hydrophilic loops between transmembrane domains II/III and VI/VII. This protein is considered a constituent of the mitochondrial inner membrane.

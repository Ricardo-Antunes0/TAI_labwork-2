Loch Ore is a loch situated in the Highland council area of Scotland. The loch lies within the Grampian Mountains, and is 8 miles (13 km) long and 1 mile (1.6 km) wide. At its deepest point, the loch is 93 feet (28 m) deep.  Loch Ore was formed about 2 million years ago, during the Grampian Ice Age. The loch has a very irregular shape, with a number of small lochs clustered together on its eastern side. The main body of the loch is relatively shallow, with a maximum depth of 29 feet (8 m). However, there are several large areas of deeper water located in the centre and north-west of the loch.  The main sources of water for Loch Ore are rainfall and snowmelt. The loch receives an annual average of 147 inches (3,500 mm) of rainfall, which feeds into the flows that feed into the river Ore. Loch Ore also receives a significant amount of snowfall each year, which helps to maintain the depth of water in the loch.  The primary use of Loch Ore is for recreational fishing. There are several dedicated fishing spots located around the loch, as well as several designated angling areas. In addition to fishing, Loch Ore is also used for swimming, boating, canoeing and kayaking.

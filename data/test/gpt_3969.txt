TV Everywhere (also known as authenticated streaming, authenticated streaming services, or authenticated streaming TV) is a platform-agnostic approach to delivering video content to users' devices. It allows providers of subscription video on demand (SVOD) services to make their video content available over the internet, without the need for users to authenticate their subscriptions with a specific provider.  TV Everywhere was first proposed in 2010 by then-Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, and was officially launched in the United States in 2013. As of February 2018, it is available in over 100 countries and territories. TV Everywhere services are typically integrated with existing pay-TV platforms, allowing users to access their subscriptions from any device that has an internet connection.  The concept has been criticized for its potential to fragment the television audience, as well as its potential to disrupt the traditional pay-TV ecosystem. However, TV Everywhere has been praised for its potential to increase viewership of subscription content, as well as its potential to foster innovation by providing new ways for users to access subscription content.

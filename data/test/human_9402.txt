Frank Mokros, known professionally as Totakeke, is a NY-based electronic music producer. He also goes by the names of Synth-Etik and Ativ. As Totakeke, Mokros explores a new direction where the focus lies more within the atmosphere, tension and individual elements of sound that construct these compositions as opposed to the more high-BPM style and pure aggression of his other projects. Totakeke combine layers of dark, spacey ambience with intricate, slowly evolving analog rhythmic patterns (both distorted and clean), while precision synth sequences interweave throughout the mixes.

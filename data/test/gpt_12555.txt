William Turner (1651/2â€“13 January 1740, London) was an English composer, organist, and conductor. He is principally remembered for his vocal and instrumental compositions, notably the epic poem The Faerie Queene.  Born in 1651 or 1652 in London, Turner was the son of a musician named William Turner, who may have been a choirboy in Westminster Abbey. From an early age he showed an interest in music and began to learn to play the organ and violin. In 1672 he became a chorister at Westminster Abbey, where he remained until 1681. Around this time he began to compose secular music, although he was not officially appointed as a composer until 1685. In that year he also became organist of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.  In 1687 Turner left Windsor Castle and moved to Oxfordshire, where he became organist of Christ Church Cathedral. He remained in this position until his death thirteen years later. During his time in Oxfordshire, Turner composed several cantatas, or sacred works for solo voice and orchestra. His most famous work from this period is the epic poem The Faerie Queene, which was first performed at Oxford in 1689 and published the following year.  Turner's later life was plagued by financial difficulties. In 1713 he was offered a knighthood but refused it on the grounds that it would require him to give up his position as organist of Christ Church Cathedral. He died thirteen years later in 1740 and was buried in the churchyard

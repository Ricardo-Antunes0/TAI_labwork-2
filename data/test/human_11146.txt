Afghans in Ukraine are the country's largest diasporic community with origins outside of the former Soviet Union. During the existence of the Soviet Union, Afghans were the largest foreign group studying in Ukraine. After the resignation of the pro-Soviet president of Afghanistan, Mohammad Najibullah, in 1992, some Afghans in Ukraine applied for asylum. Other Afghans had returned to Afghanistan and served in the security forces during the Afghan Civil War of 1989 to 1992, with some then returning to Ukraine. Some male students married Ukrainian women. Many Afghans in Ukraine live in Kyiv and Dnipro, where some run small businesses that recruit workers from Afghanistan. There is also an Afghan community in Odesa, "made up of successive waves of exiles, refugees, and migrants" as well as commercial traders. The 2001 Ukrainian census recorded 1,008 people of Afghan nationality. In 2019, Ukraine was hosting 1,034 Afghan refugees. At the end of 2020, 1,449 Afghans had permanent residency in Ukraine and 233 had temporary visas.

G-A-Y is a long-running gay nightclub, based in London, England.  G-A-Y was founded in 1989 as a small venue on London's South Bank, and soon became one of the capital's most popular gay nightspots. In the early 2000s G-A-Y underwent a significant renovation, doubling its size and adding a new dancefloor. The venue has since been cited as an influential force in the development of London's LGBT nightlife scene, and has hosted performances by some of the world's leading drag queens and DJs.  In 2015 G-A-Y was acquired by the property firm Capital & Regional. In March 2018 Capital & Regional announced that it would be closing G-A-Y due to lack of profitability.

Michael Gleason is an American musician, singer and songwriter, best known as one of the founding members of the 1980s rock band AD. Biography Gleason grew up around Wichita, Kansas. He was drawn to music at a young age. When he was in high school and early college he became increasingly interested in 1970s progressive rock music. In particular, he was an admirer of Kansas. He had performed in night clubs for years before he joined Kansas as a touring member. Despite being increasingly attracted by rock music, he did not choose a typical rock'n'roll lifestyle but he wanted to share a positive message, written from a Christian worldview. As Gleason stated in an interview in 1990, "I had the very good fortune of being raised in a home with two parents who were strong committed believers. So whether Jesus Christ was the truth or was real was never really a question. It was in my earliest upbringing. It was a natural part of me as a child. Of course, there came that moment of truth later on as an adolescent where I internalised that and made it my own. I'm committed to it, and have seen it borne out in the lives of people around me".

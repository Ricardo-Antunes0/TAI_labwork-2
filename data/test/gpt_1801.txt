Wu Rui was a Hainanese eunuch in the service of the Chinese Emperor Qin Shi Huang. He is best known for his role in the execution of the scholar, Zhang Xiu.  Wu Rui was born in the early years of the Western Han Dynasty to a family of eunuch officials. He started his career as a page in the court of Emperor Wen of Han. In 195 BC, he was appointed as one of the Eight Eunuchs, and later served as a secretary in the court of Emperor Shao of Han.  In 191 BC, when Qin Shi Huang ascended to the throne, he appointed Wu Rui as his chief eunuch and governor of Jiangxi Province. In this capacity, Wu Rui played an important role in quelling the revolt of Zhang Xiu, a scholar from Luoyang who had opposed Qin's rule. Zhang Xiu was arrested and executed at Wu Rui's orders.  Wu Rui died in 187 BC. He was posthumously honoured with the title "Prince Yan", and his tomb has been preserved to this day.

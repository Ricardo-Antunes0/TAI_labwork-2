Margaret Melhase Fuchs (August 13, 1919August 8, 2006) was an American chemist and a co-discoverer, with Glenn T. Seaborg, of the isotope caesium-137. Education and research career  In 1940, Melhase was an undergraduate in the college of chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. She was president of the Student Affiliates of the American Chemical Society and was considering doctoral studies and a career in chemistry. Honors students typically took on research projects at the time, and she sought advice from her close friend, nuclear chemist Gerhart Friedlander; Friedlander was then a graduate student under the supervision of Glenn T. Seaborg, and he suggested she approach him for a project. She spoke to Seaborg in his lab, and he proposed they work together to search for a Group 1 element among the fission products of uranium. Her laboratory was above those of Nobel Prize winners Willard Libby and Melvin Calvin.

Brown's Park or Browns Park, originally called Brown's Hole, is an isolated mountain valley along the Green River in Moffat County, Colorado and Daggett County, Utah in the United States. The valley begins in far eastern Utah, approximately  downstream from Flaming Gorge Dam, and follows the river downstream into Colorado, ending at the Gates of Lodore in Dinosaur National Monument. Known as a haven for outlaws such as Butch Cassidy and Tom Horn during the late 19th century and the early 20th century, it is now the location of the Browns Park National Wildlife Refuge. It was also the birthplace of Ann Bassett. She and her sister Josie Bassett, were considered female outlaws and girlfriends to several of Cassidy's Wild Bunch gang.  It is the location of John Jarvie Historic Ranch, where, in 1880, Scotsman John Jarvie built a ranch along the Green River. History According to Robert Redford, The earliest-known reference to Brown's Park was made in 1650 in the writings of Father Ortiz, a Spanish missionary. In 1825, the expedition of William H. Ashley and his fur trappers penetrated the valley in bull-boats along the Green River. In 1827 Kit Carson traded here among the Ute and Shoshone Indians. The same year a trader named Baptiste Chalifoux came to the valley with his Indian wife and the valley was named in his honor under the alias 'Baptiste Brown'."

Incredible Games is a children's game show that aired on PBS from 1988 to 1996. It was created by producer and writer Sidney Sheinberg, who also created the game show Password.  The show featured kids playing games against each other in various challenges, including a "Jeopardy!"-style jeopardy game where contestants risked losing points if they couldn't answer a question. The show also featured regular segments such as "What's My Line?" and "Name That Tune".  After its run on PBS, the show was syndicated to stations around the United States, including WGN America and TBS. However, it was cancelled after four seasons due to low ratings.

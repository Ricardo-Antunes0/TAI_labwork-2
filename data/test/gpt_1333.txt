Aude G. Billard (born c. August 6, 1931) is a French mathematical physicist. She is known for discovering a new method of solving the Euler–Lagrange equations of motion, and for her work on the theory of fractional calculus.  Aude Billard was born in 1931 in France. After completing her undergraduate studies at the University of Paris, she completed her Ph.D. at the University of Paris in 1957 under the supervision of Jean-Pierre Serre. Her doctoral thesis was titled "Sur la méthode de solutions des équations du mouvement aux dérivées partielles".  Billard began her academic career as an associate professor at the University of Paris in 1957, and then became a full professor at the University of Grenoble in 1965. In 1980 she became a professor at the Collège de France, where she currently holds the Chair of Mathematical Physics.  One of Billard's most notable achievements is her discovery of a new method of solving the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion. This method is known as Billard's algorithm, and it has proved to be very effective for solving these equations. Additionally, Billard has done significant work on the theory of fractional calculus, which has been instrumental in developing many modern techniques in mathematics and physics.

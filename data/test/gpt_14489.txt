In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257 (1948), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a state court's removal of a criminal defendant from the jurisdiction of the federal court where the defendant was being tried violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution.  The defendant, Oliver, was charged with robbing several banks in California. He moved to federal court to have his case transferred to a more favorable district, arguing that he would be unfairly tried twice for the same crime. The state court refused, and Oliver was convicted and sentenced to prison. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed his conviction on the grounds that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a defendant from being tried twice for the same crime.

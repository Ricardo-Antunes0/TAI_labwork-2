Felix Headley Bennett OD (29 May 1931 â€“ 21 August 2016), also known as Deadly Headley, was a Jamaican saxophonist who performed on hundreds of recordings since the 1950s. Biography Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Bennett attended the Alpha Boys School from the age of five, where he learned to play the saxophone. He left Alpha aged fifteen. Since the 1950s, Bennett has worked as a session musician in Jamaica, playing in the Studio One house band as well as in Lynn Taitt's band The Jets, The Mighty Vikings, and in The Revolutionaries. In 1962, as a member of The Sheiks, he performed at Palisadoes Airport to greet Princess Margaret on her visit to the island to mark Jamaica's independence. In the ska era of the late 1950s and 1960s, he played on many recordings for a variety of studios including Bob Marley's first recording, "Judge Not", for Leslie Kong, and Derrick & Patsy's "Housewives Choice". Prince Buster claimed Bennett's solo in Derrick Morgan's song "Forward March" was stolen from Lester Sterling's solo in Buster's own track "They Got to Come", leading to a feud between Buster and Morgan. He went on to record with The Abyssinians, Alton Ellis, and Prince Far I among many others. In the late 1960s he moved to Canada, returning to Jamaica in 1977.

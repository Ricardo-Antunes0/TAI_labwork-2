19 Puppis is a binary star system in the equatorial constellation of Puppis. The primary star is a white dwarf, the shrunken core of a late-type star. The secondary star is a hot blue-white main sequence star.  The system is approximately 470 light years from Earth, and was first observed by French astronomer J. J. Laskar in 1886. 19 Puppis A was identified as a possible planet by American astronomer W. M. Fick in 1908, and by the radial velocity method in 1915; however, subsequent observations failed to confirm the existence of a planet. In 1969, Japanese astronomer YÅ«suke Koyama independently determined that 19 Puppis A had an orbiting companion, 19 Puppis B, using the radial velocity method and photometry.  The system is notable for its variable light output, which ranges from a magnitude of 6.5 to 11.2 over a period of about 2 hours 47 minutes. This variability is caused by the companion star's gravity tugging on the white dwarf's atmosphere, which causes it to brighten and then dim over time.

"Eneboerne" (The Hermits) is one of the early short stories by the Danish author Karen Blixen. It was published in the journal Tilskueren in August 1907 under the pen name Osceola, a famous early 19th-century Native American leader. It tells the story of Lucie and Eugène, a young couple who go to a deserted island where Eugène can better apply himself to writing a book. Increasingly isolated, Lucie is drawn into a world of dreams and the forces of nature. The ghost of a deceased army officer convinces her that her place is not on the island. Ultimately, overcome by the eternal forces of the sea, the sky and the earth, she is tempted into the ocean where she drowns. On "Eneboerne"'s publication, Valdemar Vedel (1865–1942), the literary critic and editor of Tilskueren, recognized Blixen's talent for writing. She was not, however, ready to devote herself to a literary career at this stage, preferring to continue studying art and travelling across Europe.

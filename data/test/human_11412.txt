Kloss's gibbon (Hylobates klossii), also known as the Mentawai gibbon, the bilou or dwarf siamang, is an endangered primate in the gibbon family, Hylobatidae. It is identifiable in that it is all black, resembling the siamang with its black fur, but is considerably smaller and lacks the siamang's distinctive throat pouch. Kloss's gibbon reaches a size 17 to 25 inches (44 to 63 cm) and weigh at most 13 pounds (6 kg). As is the case for all gibbons, they have long arms and no tail. Kloss's gibbon exclusively lives on the Mentawai Islands that lie to the west of Sumatra. It is a diurnal inhabitant of the rain forest that hangs in the trees from its long arms and rarely comes to the ground. Like all species of gibbons it lives together in pairs that stake out a territory from approximately 49 to 74 acres (20 to 30 hectares) of size. This area is defended vehemently against other gibbons. Its diet consists mainly of fruits, occasionally also eating different plant parts, bird eggs, insects and small vertebrates.

Syd Solomon (July 12, 1917 – January 28, 2004) was an American abstract artist. He spent most of his time in his homes in both East Hampton, NY and Sarasota, Florida which influenced many of his paintings. His works have been featured at The Guggenheim, The Whitney, Corcoran Gallery of Art, The Wadsworth Athenaeum and several others. Early life Solomon was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania to a Jewish family. He started painting in high school.  He would eventually go on to study art at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1935 to 1938. In 1940 he enlisted in the Engineer Aviation Regiment, First Camouflage Battalion of the military.  During this time Solomon helped design camouflage for the California coast near the San Francisco area.  Later he was assigned to the Royal Engineer Camouflage Corps in London where he designed camouflage to be used against the Germans in World War II. He even went on to earn the Bronze star for his contributions during the Battle of the Bulge.  During his time in London he mostly performed aerial reconnaissance which inspired his ideas of abstract art.  After leaving the military he went on to attend classes at the French art school L’Ecole des Beaux-Arts in 1945.

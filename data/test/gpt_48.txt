Eight ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS Rocket, after the 1853 Royal Navy vessel of the same name.  The first HMS Rocket was an ironclad warship built for the Royal Navy in 1853. She was the first steam-powered warship to be built for the Royal Navy, and was also the first vessel to be propelled by a rocket engine. HMS Rocket served in a number of conflicts during her lifetime, including the Crimean War, the Indian Mutiny, and the Second Boer War. She was eventually decommissioned in 1901, and was sold for scrap in 1904.

The Kremlin Senate (The Senate Palace, ) is the upper house of the Federal Assembly of Russia, which is the lower house of the Russian parliament. The first sitting of the Senate took place on 9 July 1793.  The Upper House (Russian: Сенат Кремля) is one of two houses of the Federal Assembly of Russia, the other being the House of Representatives. The Constitution of Russia allows for a maximum of 300 members in the Senate, but currently has 343 members. The Senate is composed of 168 members from regional constituencies, who are elected for a six-year term by direct voting. Members are nominated by the President of Russia and approved by the Federal Assembly.   The Upper House has considerably less power than the Lower House (the Duma), although it does have exclusive jurisdiction over certain matters, including constitutional amendments and international treaties. In addition, it can initiate legislation itself and can pass resolutions without being subject to veto from the Duma. The Senate also has powers to investigate issues that come before it and to issue reports on its findings, which can then be used as evidence in future legislative proceedings.   Since 1996, when Russian president Boris Yeltsin dissolved the Soviet Union and granted federal sovereignty to its constituent republics, the Upper House has also acted as a chamber of parliament for each republic.

The interferometric visibility (also known as interference contrast, or sometimes as the visibility contrast) is a measure of how visible two objects are to one another when seen through a medium with an interference pattern. It is defined as the difference between the direct and reflected beams of light that pass through a medium, and is measured in milliradians (mrad).  Interferometric visibility is used in radar and optical communication systems, and can be used to determine the distance to an object. It can also be used to measure the thickness of a layer of material.

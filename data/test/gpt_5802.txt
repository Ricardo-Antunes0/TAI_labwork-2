Vermont coppers were copper coins issued by the United States from 1793 to 1873. The coins were minted in Philadelphia, but production was discontinued after the New York City mint closed. The coins were worth one-eighth of an ounce of gold.  The copper coins were first issued in 1793. The design changed little over the years, with the exception of the weight and denomination, which changed several times. The most common denomination was the half dollar, which was minted from 1793 to 1857. Other denominations included the dime (1816 to 1873), quarter dollar (1824 to 1857), and dollar (1834 to 1873).  Production of the copper coins ceased in 1873, after which they were replaced by paper money. Today, copper coins are not legal tender in the United States, but are often collected as numismatic items.

The Kennebunkport Historic District encompasses most of the historic downtown area of Kennebunkport, Maine. The district is bounded on the south by Ocean Avenue and on the west by Congress Street, and extends north to the shoreline. The buildings in the district date from the 18th to the early 21st century, and include a variety of commercial, civic, and residential structures. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.  The town of Kennebunkport was founded in 1758 by Jonathan Edwards, a Congregationalist preacher and later president of Princeton University. The town grew slowly at first, but began to prosper in the late 18th century as a result of its proximity to Portland and the shipping trade on the Kennebec River. The downtown area of Kennebunkport was largely built up between 1810 and 1860, and includes many well-preserved examples of Federalist architecture. Most of the significant buildings in the district were built during this period, including the First Baptist Church (1810), the Masonic Temple (1828), and the County Court House (1840). The district has been largely preserved since its designation as a historic district in 1988, and includes a number of well-maintained buildings that are important examples of architecture in rural Maine.

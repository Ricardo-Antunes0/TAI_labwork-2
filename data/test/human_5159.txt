Grevillea pachylostyla, commonly known as Buchan River grevillea,  is a  shrub species which is endemic to the upper reaches of the Buchan River in the eastern highlands of Victoria, in Australia.    It has a spreading habit, growing to 1.5 metres high. The leaves are deeply lobed. Flowers appear between  October and February (mid spring to late summer) in its native range. These have cream perianths with contrasting black underneath and inside and cream styles that turn pink or red after antithesis. The taxon was first formally described in 1986 by Donald McGillivray as a subspecies of Grevillea willisii, namely G. willissi subsp. pachylostyla. This description was based on a collection by James Hamlyn Willis in the Reedy River gorge on the Nunniong Plateau in Eastern Victoria in  November 1964. It was promoted to species status in 1994 by Peter Olde and Neil Marriott. Plants which appear to be intermediate between this species and G. willisi have been collected near Gelantipy.

It is often described as a gut wrenching power ballad with screamo undertones and heavy riffs not typical of the usual power ballad. Throughout the song it bounces between an Alternative Metal and a Thrash Metal vibe with softer periods.  Kirari showcases the softer side of Dazzle Vision much like their previous album Crystal Children, clashing pop and rock into tunes such as Continue and Divided. The entire concept of the song is both symbolizes the rebirth of the band but the anger about the band's relationship with the Japanese music industry.

TGM5 is a transglutaminase enzyme. TGM5 encodes a protein that is a member of the transglutaminase family. The encoded protein catalyzes the cross-linking of glutamine residues in proteins.  The TGM5 protein is important for the cross-linking of glutamine residues in proteins. Cross-linking is a process that helps to stabilize proteins and improve their function.

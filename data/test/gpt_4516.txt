Static Prevails is the second studio album by American rock band Paramore. It was released on September 9, 2009, by Fueled by Ramen and Atlantic Records. Static Prevails is a departure from the punk rock and emo sound of their first album, Riot! and features a more pop-punk sound.  Paramore started working on Static Prevails in early 2008 at the band's practice space in Nashville. The album was produced by former Death Cab for Cutie producer Rich Costey, who helped to create a more radio-friendly sound for the band. Static Prevails debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling 208,000 copies in its first week. The album has since sold over 1.2 million copies in the US.  Static Prevails received generally positive reviews from music critics. Many praised the band's new sound and Costey's production, while others found the album derivative of other pop-punk bands. Paramore embarked on a tour in support of Static Prevails throughout 2009, which became their most successful tour to date.

Shesha , also known as Sheshanaga (Sanskrit: शेषनाग; ) or Adishesha , is a Hindu mythological serpent also known as the Nagaraja or King of all serpents and one of the primal beings of creation. In the Puranas, Shesha is said to hold all the planets of the universe on his hoods and to constantly sing the glories of the God Vishnu from all his mouths. He is sometimes referred to as Ananta Shesha, which translates as Endless-Shesha or Adishesha "First Shesha". It is said that when Adishesa uncoils, time moves forward and creation takes place; when he coils back, the universe ceases to exist. Vishnu is often depicted as resting on Shesha. Shesha is considered a devotee or bhakt of Vishnu. He is said to have descended to Earth in the human forms or incarnations: Lakshman, brother of Vishnu's incarnation Ram during Treta Yuga, and as Balaram, brother of Vishnu's incarnation Krishna during Dvapara Yuga. According to the Mahabharat (Adi Parva), his Father was Kashyapa and his Mother Kadru.

Keymaker is a fictional character, portrayed by actor David Duchovny, on the American television series "The X-Files". A keymaker is a person who creates or repairs keys.  Keymaker first appears in the episode "Pusher", in which he helps FBI agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) solve a murder. In subsequent episodes, Keymaker becomes a recurring character, and often assists Mulder in his investigations. He has also made occasional appearances in the show's subsequent films and spin-offs.  Keymaker has never been explicitly identified as a member of any specific profession, and his role on the show has varied over time. He has been seen as a locksmith, carpenter, and even musician, but has also been called a "cryptologist" and "computer hacker".  Duchovny has said that he auditioned for the part of Keymaker by reading a script for an episode that did not include the character. The producers liked what they saw and decided to keep him in the role.

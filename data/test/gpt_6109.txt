D'Alembert's principle, also known as the Lagrangeâ€“d'Alembert principle or d'Alembert's equation, is a mathematical principle that states that in any system of multiple bodies, the total motion of each body is a sum of the motions of the individual bodies. The principle is named for its discoverers, French mathematician Jean-Baptiste D'Alembert and Italian mathematician Luigi Lagrange.  D'Alembert's principle is used to solve problems involving multiple objects in motion. It can be used to find the positions and velocities of multiple objects, to find the forces between objects, and to solve problems involving collisions. The principle can also be used to approximate solutions to more complicated problems.

Villa 69 (Arabic: فيلا ٦٩) is a 2013 Egyptian film drama by director Ayten Amin, starring Khaled Abol Naga, Lebleba, and Arwa Gouda.  The film stars Naga as a terminally ill architect who, while living happily in solitude, is forced to alter the way he lives when his sister and grandson move in with him. The film was directed by Amin and distributed by Al Massa Art Production. The film was shot in multiple locations in Egypt including Manial and Cairo. The film Villa 69 was inspired by the director's (Ayten Amin's) father, who fell ill for two years before passing away, which was the family's most intimate time with him. Amin states: "I realized that the last two years were the best ones." This experience with her father was not dramatic, but more about overcoming everyday conflicts. Therefore, in Amin's film, the terminally ill, moody old man, Hussein is a tribute to her own father; fighting with his elder sister and great-nephew, until his gentler side shows.

Eversley Manor is a manor in Eversley, Hampshire, England. Mentioned in the Domesday Book, in 1669, it was purchased by Sir Andrew Henley of Bramshill House, who then ran it. History The manor of Eversley for a considerable period was held by four freemen of King Edward the Confessor, but towards the close of his reign, that king transferred the overlordship to the abbey of St. Peter, Westminster. This charter was confirmed by William the Conqueror, and at the time of the Domesday Survey, Eversley, then assessed at four hides, was in the possession of the abbey. In 1280, the Abbot of Westminster, as overlord of Eversley, was summoned to show his claim. Though the result is not given on the roll, the abbot's warranty lay in the charter of Edward the Confessor. The overlordship continued with Westminster Abbey as late at least as the end of the 15th century, the manor being held by the annual payment of a yearling sparrowhawk. By the beginning of the 13th century, the four freemen had been succeeded in the actual ownership of Eversley by William de Wauton, who, in 1237, made an agreement with his tenant, William Banastre, about the mill pond in Eversley.

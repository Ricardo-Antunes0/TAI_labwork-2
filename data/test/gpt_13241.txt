Prince Konstantin Dadiani (, ; 18 October 1892 â€“ 12 September 1941) was a Prince of Imperial House of Russia and an officer in the Russian Imperial Army.  Konstantin Dadiani was born in 1892 in the Russian Empire to Prince Dadiani, who was one of the most eminent military officers of his era. Konstantin joined the Russian military in 1912 and fought in World War I, where he was awarded the Order of Saint George for his bravery. After the war, he joined the counterintelligence service and rose through the ranks to become a colonel by 1939. That year, he became head of the military intelligence service and served until his death in 1941 during the German invasion of Russia. Konstantin Dadiani was one of only two princes ever to hold such a high position in the Russian army; the other was his brother Prince Grigory Dadiani.  Konstantin Dadiani is best known for his role in Operation Barbarossa, which was launched on 22 June 1941 to invade Nazi-occupied Europe. As head of military intelligence, Konstantin played a key role in planning and executing the invasion, which ultimately failed due to Soviet resistance. Konstantin Dadiani was killed during the Battle of Smolensk on 12 September 1941, just days before Nazi Germany capitulated. He is buried in Moscow's Red Square.

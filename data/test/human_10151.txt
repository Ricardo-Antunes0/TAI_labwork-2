Hugh Joseph Chisholm I (; May 2, 1847 â€“ July 1, 1912) was a Canadian industrialist who later became a citizen of the United States. He was born in Chippawa, Ontario, to parents of Scottish ancestry. His early years as an entrepreneur in the news distribution business provided a foundation for his later accomplishments in the pulp and paper industry. His founding and leadership of pulp and paper, fibre-ware, and light and power companies as well as banks and railways made him a dominant figure in Maine industry. His legacy went beyond his reputation as a capitalist, however; he created the first forest management program for International Paper Company and developed a planned community for the workers in his mills which was a model for the nation. Early life Hugh J. Chisholm was the fifth of ten children of Alexander Chisholm and Mary Margaret Phelan of Niagara-on-the-Lake in Ontario, Canada. He attended school there until he was thirteen, when his father's death made it necessary for him to leave school to help support the family. In Toronto, he found employment as a newsboy distributing newspapers to passengers on the Grand Trunk Railway and the steamboats, where he made friends with Thomas Edison, who was a newsboy on a nearby line.

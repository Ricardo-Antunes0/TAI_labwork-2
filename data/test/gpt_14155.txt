The Arab Maghreb Union (AMU)  is a regional organization of Arab states in North Africa, including Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt.  The AMU was conceived in 2004 in Rabat, Morocco, during the Arab League Summit. The idea was endorsed by all members of the League at the time, with the exception of Syria which opposed it because it did not believe that the Arab world could afford another organization. The creation of the AMU was seen as a way to counterbalance French influence in North Africa.  The AMU is an organzation with a Council of Ministers that meets regularly to discuss issues affecting the region. It has a Secretariat based in Tunis and regional offices in Algiers, Casablanca, Rabat, Tripoli and Cairo.  As of February 2014, the member states are: Algeria, Bahrain, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt.

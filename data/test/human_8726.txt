The Opel Crossland (known until 2020 as the Opel Crossland X) is a subcompact crossover SUV, marketed as the Vauxhall Crossland X then the Vauxhall Crossland in the United Kingdom, officially unveiled to the media in January 2017. The car was officially shown at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2017 as the Opel Crossland X. It went on sale in the summer of 2017. At the same time, the Opel Meriva was discontinued, as demand for crossovers and SUVs in the B segment is continually growing at the expense of compact MPVs. Overview The Crossland is built at the Opel factory in Zaragoza, Spain. It is based on a modified version of Groupe PSA's PF1 platform, which is used by the Citroën C3 Picasso and the Peugeot 2008, shared with the Citroën C3 Aircross. The Crossland X received a facelift in 2020 and was renamed to “Opel Crossland”, dropping the "X".

The Sieges of Haddington were a series of military sieges conducted by the English Parliamentarians against the Royalist garrison of Haddington Castle in East Lothian, Scotland between 1652 and 1655.  The Parliamentarians attempted to besiege Haddington Castle in March 1652, but were unsuccessful and withdrew. The Royalists nevertheless made favourable terms with the Parliamentarians and a new attempt was made the following year. On 25 July 1653, the Parliamentarian forces surrounded the castle and began an artillery bombardment, which lasted for five days. The Royalists then surrendered, leaving behind their arms and ammunition.   The final siege took place from 3 September to 2 October 1655. The Parliamentarians again attempted to storm the castle, but were met with heavy resistance from the Royalist garrison. The siege finally ended after a three-day bombardment, during which the castle was destroyed.

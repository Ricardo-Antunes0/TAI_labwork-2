Juan Bautista Cabral (24 June 1789 – 3 February 1813) was an Argentine soldier, of Zambo origin, of the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers who died in the Battle of San Lorenzo, while he was aiding then Colonel Don José de San Martín, whose horse had fallen to enemy fire. The action of Cabral in this first military confrontation of the Argentine War of Independence gave him lasting fame and a prominent place among Argentine patriots. Biography Little is known about the life of Cabral. It is estimated that he was born in the town which now bears his name in the city of Saladas, Corrientes. He joined the second squadron of the newly formed Granaderos Cavalry Regiment in 1812. According to Pastor Obligado, Cabral's diligence and leadership led to corporal's stripes in December of the same year, and to promotion to sergeant the next year. Contrary to this assertion, Bartolomé Mitre (in his Historia de San Martín y de la Emancipación Americana) states that he was a private ("soldado raso") on the date of the battle.

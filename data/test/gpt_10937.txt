Language pedagogy is the discipline concerned with the teaching of language. In its broadest sense, it includes any activity or intervention aimed at facilitating the acquisition, development, or use of language by a pupil.  The field of language pedagogy has seen a great deal of growth in recent years, as educators have come to recognize the importance of language in creating and understanding communication. Language pedagogy can be used in a variety of settings, including formal educational institutions such as universities and colleges, as well as informal settings such as home and community-based programs.  One of the key goals of language pedagogy is to help pupils develop the ability to speak, read, and write fluently and effectively. In addition to teaching specific language skills, language pedagogy also aims to foster learners' critical thinking skills, social skills, and creativity.

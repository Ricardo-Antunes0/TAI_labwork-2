Merritt Turetsky is American ecosystem ecologist who has made important contributions to the understanding of how physical and biological systems interact. He is currently a Professor at the University of California, Berkeley.  Merritt Turetsky was born in 1951 in New York City. After graduating from college, he worked as a research associate at the University of California, Davis. In 1979, he received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, where he worked as a post-doctoral researcher until 1984.  Turetsky's research has focused on the study of how physical and biological systems interact. He is particularly known for his work on the dynamics of ecosystems, including the role of disturbance in maintaining balance and resilience within ecosystems. His work has led to new insights into how forest ecosystems function and how they respond to changes in climate and land use.  Turetsky has also made significant contributions to our understanding of population dynamics and how they impact ecosystem health. He is also known for his work on genetic algorithms and artificial intelligence, which has helped to develop new methods for predicting ecological outcomes.  In 2007, Turetsky was awarded the Medal for Distinguished Scientific Achievement by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). He is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).  Turetsky currently serves as a Professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

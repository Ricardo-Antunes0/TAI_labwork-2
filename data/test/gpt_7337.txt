Wehrum is an abandoned coal mining company town in southwestern York County, Pennsylvania, United States. The town was founded in 1892 and abandoned in the early 1980s. It is located on the banks of the Susquehanna River, just downstream from the mouth of the Little Schuylkill River.  Wehrum was founded in 1892 as a coal mining company town by the Wehrum Coal Company. The town was initially located on the east bank of the Susquehanna River, but was relocated to its present location in 1905. The town was abandoned in the early 1980s due to declining coal production and Mine Safety and Health Administration violations. Today, most of Wehrum remains abandoned, with only a few homes and businesses remaining.

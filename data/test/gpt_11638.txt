Opened in 1988, it featured a collection of musical instruments from all over Scotland, as well as documents and photographs relating to Scottish folk music. The museum closed in November 2010 due to a lack of funding.   The museum was founded by Dr Iain Banks and Dr Alex Paterson and was housed in the former Royal High School on Princes Street. It initially had a small collection of instruments and photographs, but this grew rapidly with donations from individuals and organisations. The museum's original premises were inadequate for its collections, so it moved to new premises on North Bridge in 1998.  The Scots Musical Museum played an important role in the revival of Scottish traditional music. It provided an accessible resource for scholars, students and the public at large, and helped to promote the Scots musical tradition internationally. Its collections are now held by the National Library of Scotland.

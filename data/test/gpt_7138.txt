Emergency Powers (No. 362) Order 1945 or the Emergency Powers (No. 362) Order 1945, was an order of the British government issued on 4 September 1945, during the Second World War, that gave Prime Minister Clement Attlee wide-ranging emergency powers.  The order was issued in response to the increasing threat of a German invasion of Britain and its colonies, and was intended to allow the government to take rapid action without the need for parliamentary approval. It allowed the government to suspend civil liberties, impose censorship and control the media. The order remained in force for eight months, until it was superseded by the Emergency Powers Act 1945.

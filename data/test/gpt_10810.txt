Fresco (plural frescos or frescoes) is a technique of painting, usually on a dry plaster surface. The term is derived from the Italian fresco, meaning "fresh." Frescoes were often painted on temporary panels that could be moved or removed, so that one room could be used as a studio for a series of paintings.  Fresco was the first technique to be used in art, and was much used in the Middle Ages. It was revived in the Renaissance, and more recently has been used in modern times. Many frescos are now protected by law as being of cultural heritage.

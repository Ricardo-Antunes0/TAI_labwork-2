The European Quidditch Cup, also known as EQC and formerly as the European Quidditch Championship, is the culminating championship tournament for the sport of quidditch in Europe. It began to be legitimised in 2014 when the International Quidditch Association became an international federation for quidditch. The first tournament took place in 2012 in France as quidditch began to develop across Europe. Today, the tournament is the highest level of championship in Europe besides the European Games with league-level tournaments being the qualifying competitions. In 2019, Division 1 of EQC was held in Harelbeke, Belgium, where the Paris Titans won the championship for the fourth time in their history. History Originally held in Lesparre-MÃ©doc, France, EQC has since grown into the largest quidditch tournament in Europe. EQC 2014 saw teams from almost more countries than the 2014 Global Games, and EQC 2015 is expecting to receive teams from at least twelve different quidditch-playing nations.

Daniel B. Sparr (June 8, 1931 â€“ March 5, 2013) was an American physicist who made significant contributions to the theory of nuclear magnetic resonance.  Sparr was born in Brooklyn, New York, on June 8, 1931. He received his B.S. from Brooklyn College in 1951 and his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1955. He then worked at the University of California, Berkeley, until he moved to the University of Utah in 1977. He retired from the University of Utah in 2003.  Sparr made significant contributions to the theory of nuclear magnetic resonance, developing mathematical models to describe how nuclear spins interact with each other. His work has helped to improve our understanding of the behavior of nuclei and molecules inside the nucleus.

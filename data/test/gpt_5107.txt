Sir John Trevor (c. 1637 â€“ 20 March 1689) was an English speaker and clergyman who served as the first Speaker of the House of Commons of England, from 1677 to 1679.  After studying at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became a fellow in 1660, Trevor was ordained in 1664 and became a chaplain to the Duke of York. He was appointed the Rector of Radcliffe-on-Soar in 1672 and became Dean of Worcester in 1677. When the House of Commons consisted of only a small number of members, Trevor was elected its first Speaker on 22 January 1677. He served in this role until 1679, when he resigned due to poor health. Trevor died two years later at the age of 57.

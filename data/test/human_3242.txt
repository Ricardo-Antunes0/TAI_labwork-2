Tranquil Star (foaled in 1937) was one of the hardiest and best performed Australian-bred Thoroughbred race-mares. She is the only mare to have won the double of the Caulfield Stakes, now known as the Yalumba Stakes, and the Cox Plate, which is the most prestigious weight-for-age (wfa) race in Australia. Tranquil Star had 111 starts and won over distances ranging from 5 furlongs (1,000 metres) to 14 furlongs (2,800 metres). She was later inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame. Breeding She was bred by Messrs H. G. Raymond and H. B. Ranken at St Albans Stud near Geelong, Victoria and was by the good imported sire, Gay Lothario (sire of winners of Â£266,000), her dam was the non-winner, Lone Star, who was by a good sire in Great Star (GB). Tranquil Star was a sister to the non-stakes-winners, Sun Beau (four wins), Paringa (two wins), Flighty (unplaced) and The Ritz (six wins), who were indifferent racehorses. She was also a half-sister to Only Star, by Enfield, who was unable to win a race in 13 starts. Tranquil Star descended from Daffodils Dam through Lady Vivian (GB), who were from the Bruce Lowe family 20.

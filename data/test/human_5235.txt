Pete (also called Peg-Leg Pete, Pistol Pete and Black Pete, among other names)  is a fictional character of The Walt Disney Company. He was created in 1925 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks and often appears as a nemesis and the main antagonist in Mickey Mouse universe cartoons and comics. He was originally an anthropomorphic bear, but with the advent of Mickey Mouse in 1928, he was defined as a cat. Pete is the oldest continuing Disney character, having debuted three years before Mickey Mouse in the cartoon Alice Solves the Puzzle (1925). Pete was unnamed in the first year of Mickey Mouse cartoons until 1930 when he was given the name Peg-Leg Pete. Pete appeared in 67 animated short films between 1925 and 1954, having been featured in the Alice Comedies and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons, and later in the Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy cartoons. Pete's final appearance during this era was The Lone Chipmunks (1954), which was the final installment of a three-part Chip n' Dale series. He also appeared in the short films Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983), The Prince and the Pauper (1990), Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers (2004), and Get a Horse! (2013).

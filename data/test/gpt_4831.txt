The inward light, Light of God, Light of Truth, or simply Light, is a term generally used in religious, spiritual and esoteric texts to describe the divine light that emanates from God or the Absolute.  The inward light is also known as the "radiance of the heart" or "inner spiritual light." It is seen as an essential component of spiritual practice and enlightenment, and is often invoked in meditation and prayer. In some religious traditions, it is seen as the source of salvation.  The inward light is often depicted as a beam of white light that enters the heart and fills it with warmth and joy. It is often seen as a symbol of spiritual enlightenment and union with God.

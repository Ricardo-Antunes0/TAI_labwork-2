The Restart Coalition  is a centre-left political alliance in Croatia. The coalition was formed in 2010 as the Kukuriku Coalition (Kukuriku koalicija). This somewhat facetious name meaning 'cock-a-doodle-doo', taken from a restaurant of the same name in Kastav where the coalition leaders first convened in July 2009, became well known and was eventually taken as the coalition's official name. The coalition originally consisted of four centrist and centre-left parties in the Croatian Parliament: the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP), Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats (HNS-LD), Croatian Party of Pensioners (HSU) and Istrian Democratic Assembly (IDS). The coalition won an absolute majority of seats in the 2011 parliamentary election and successfully formed a government led by Zoran Milanović (SDP). In the 2014–15 presidential election the coalition supported the candidacy of incumbent president Ivo Josipović. He was, however, defeated by Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović of the centre-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), becoming the first Croatian president to not win re-election.

KDSK-FM (92.7 MHz) is a radio station based in Grants, New Mexico, (population about 10,000), the county seat of Cibola County in western New Mexico. KD Radio Incorporated (KD Radio) purchased KDSK-FM in January 2001.  Having had much success with kdradio.com in California, it was decided to put the massive KD Radio oldies format of 7000 songs on the broadcast sister station, 50-year-old KMIN-AM (980 kHz).  KDSK was a hot country station at this time.  In April 2001 KMIN began streaming its Sound Souvenir's programming on the internet at kmin980.com.  On June 14, 2004 KMIN's Sound Souvenir's format moved over to KDSK-FM.  Due to the Sound Souvenir's strong showing in the ratings, number one in its market, management made the decision to move the format to the stronger KDSK-FM signal.  This move was made after one week of simulcasting the Sound Souvenir's format on both KMIN-AM and KDSK-FM.

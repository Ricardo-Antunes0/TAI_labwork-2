Vartan Makhokhian (; 31 May 1869 â€“ 10 November 1946) was an Assyrian-born Armenian physician and neurologist who lived and worked in Turkey. He is credited with being the first to describe the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, and was also a pioneer in the study of electroencephalography.  Makhokhian was born in 1869 in the Assyrian village of Qosh, near the town of Zakho, in what is now north-eastern Iraq. He studied at the French medical school at Istanbul, graduating in 1894. He then worked as a doctor in various parts of Turkey before moving to Switzerland in 1907 to take up a position at the University of Geneva as a professor of neurology. He remained at Geneva for the rest of his life, retiring in 1938.  Makhokhian is best known for his work on multiple sclerosis (MS), which he first described in detail in a paper published in 1907. He also made important contributions to the study of electroencephalography (EEG), which is used to monitor the activity of the brain. Makhokhian died in Geneva in 1946, aged 80 years.

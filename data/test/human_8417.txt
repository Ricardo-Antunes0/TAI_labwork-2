Jarrett is the only USPSA Triple Crown Winner and holds four USPSA National titles - Open, Limited, Production and Limited-10. Jarrett lives in Virginia. In an interview published by an Australian IPSC shooting magazine, Jarrett stated: "I got started in competition in 1983, shooting bowling pins. In 1984, I started shooting IPSC on Friday nights at an indoor range in Richmond, Va., with some co-workers." Another published interview mentioned that between 1988 and 2001 he shot about 1.7 million rounds during practice. "I had a gun in my hand for two hours every day for 10 years to develop my skill level. Now it's not so much practice, but more of a maintenance thing. I wasted the first million rounds just learning how to shoot."

A consumer price index (CPI) is a measure of the average change in prices of goods and services purchased by households. The CPI is calculated by dividing the total cost of all goods and services purchased by households (in current prices) by the number of households.  The CPI can be used to measure changes in the cost of living and to help determine whether a rise in prices is due to a rise in the cost of goods or a rise in the cost of services. The CPI is also used as a basis for adjusting government benefits and payments, and for setting monetary policy.  The CPI was first published in 1913. It was originally based on a sample of retail prices collected from business establishments throughout the country. However, because of the changing nature of the economy over time, more sophisticated methods have been developed to collect price data. In 1995, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) began using Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) data to produce CPI estimates.  The CPI is released monthly, with the latest release dated December 2018. The index measures changes in the average price level for consumer goods and services purchased by households. It does not measure changes in wages, salaries, or other types of income.

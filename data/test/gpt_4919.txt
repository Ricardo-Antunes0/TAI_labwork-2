The theory of belief functions, also referred to as the Dempster–Shafer theory, is a mathematical model for the belief acquisition and change of beliefs in humans. The theory was formulated by David Dempster and John Shafer in their paper "A Theory of Belief Change" in 1969.  The Dempster–Shafer theory is a probabilistic model for belief change, where the probability of a belief changing depends on the prior belief, the evidence for the belief, and the person's attitude towards the evidence. It is named after David Dempster and John Shafer, who first formulated it in their 1969 paper "A Theory of Belief Change".  The theory has been applied to a variety of situations, including belief formation, persuasion, decision-making, and memory. The theory has also been used to study various psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia.

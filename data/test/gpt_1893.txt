The Fragment Society is a charitable women's organisation that provides support and opportunities to women who have experienced personal trauma.  Fragment Society was founded in 2010 by a group of women who had all experienced trauma in their lives. We recognised that there was a need for a safe space for women who had experienced trauma to connect and support each other.  Today, Fragment Society is a thriving organisation with chapters across the UK and Ireland. We provide access to our members' resources, opportunities for networking and support, and our events offer women the chance to share their experiences, learn from others and build relationships of trust.  We believe that by providing support and opportunities to women who have experienced trauma, we can help them to recover and live their best lives. We hope that through our work, we can help reduce the incidence of trauma among women and make a positive impact on society as a whole.

The repartition of Ireland has been suggested as a solution to the ongoing political and social unrest in the country. The repartition of Ireland would involve the creation of a number of autonomous regions within the country, each with its own government and its own population.   The idea of repartition of Ireland has been raised periodically throughout the course of Irish history, but has never been implemented. Proponents of the plan argue that it would resolve the current political and social unrest in Ireland, while opponents argue that it would create more division and instability in the country.

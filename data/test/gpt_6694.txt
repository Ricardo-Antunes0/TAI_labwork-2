Fix the Debt is a group of economists and policy experts who advocate for ways to address the nation's mounting debt burden. The organization was founded in 2013 by economists Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi, and has since grown to include more than 150 members from both the political and academic spheres.  Fix the Debt advocates for a number of specific policy solutions to the nation's debt crisis, including raising taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations, cutting spending on social programs, and renegotiating public debt. The group also insists that any solution to the debt problem must be accompanied by reforms to the nation's financial system, including increased regulation of Wall Street.  Fix the Debt has been criticized by some members of the conservative movement for its calls for increased taxes and government spending cuts. But Fix the Debt has also been praised by some liberal economists for its willingness to address difficult fiscal issues head-on.

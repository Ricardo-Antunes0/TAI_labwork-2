The Spaso-Prilutsky Monastery  is a fortified (walled) Russian Orthodox  monastery in the settlement of Priluki on the bank of the Vologda River near the city of Vologda. Its history goes back to the 14th-century missionary activities of St. Sergius of Radonezh and his disciples. Most surviving buildings date from the 16th and 17th centuries. Since 1993 Priluki has been administered as part of Vologda. History The monastery was founded by Saint Demetrius of Priluki, formerly a hegumen of the Nikolsky Monastery in Pereslavl-Zalessky. Demetrius (aka Dimitry) left Pereslavl since he thought it was too crowded, and moved north. He first decided to settle down on the Obnora River (currently in Gryazovetsky District), but he was not accepted warmly by the local population, so he moved further north. After coming to a meander (priluka) of the Vologda River, he built a wooden church and the cells. The place came to be known as Priluki afterwards.

Blackie was a swaybacked horse who, for twenty-eight years, was a well-known fixture in Tiburon, California.  He not only stood in the same spot in a pasture at the corner of Tiburon Boulevard and Trestle Glen Road, rarely moving, day after day, but he faced in the same direction, becoming the local mascot of several generations. Born in Kansas, Blackie was brought to California to become a cutting horse at rodeos. After his rodeo career, he was sold to the Army and became a cavalry horse. He was retired when he was 12 years old. A short time later, Anthony Connell, his new owner, put him in the Tiburon pasture where he found his spot and stood, day after day in the same place, for 28 years. When Blackie collapsed and died while standing in “his” spot on February 27, 1966, the Marin County Health Department approved his burial in the pasture. His grave was marked by a simple cross and a memorial plaque made possible by contributions from citizens of the peninsula. In June 1995, the Tiburon Peninsula Foundation erected a life-sized sculpture of Blackie in what is now known as Blackie’s Pasture.

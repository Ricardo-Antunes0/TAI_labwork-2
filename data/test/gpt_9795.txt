WNMB (900 AM, "Carolina Country") is a radio station broadcasting a country music format. Licensed to Mocksville, North Carolina, United States, the station is currently owned by Alpha Media LLC.  WNMB first aired on September 1, 1950 as WCCO-FM. The station was founded by Clarence R. "Crazy" Cunningham and his wife Ruth. The original studio and transmitter were on North Main Street in Mocksville. WNMB was the first country music station in North Carolina and was one of the first country music stations in the United States.  WNMB's original programming consisted of country music, western swing, and bluegrass music. In the early days of country radio, WNMB was one of the few stations that played a mix of country and pop music. In the early 1960s, WNMB changed its format to all-country.  WNMB was sold to Clear Channel Communications in 1997. At that time, Clear Channel switched the station's call letters to WNCN and changed its format to gospel music. The gospel format lasted until 2001, when WNCN re-branded as "WNCN Country". In 2006, Alpha Media LLC acquired WNCN from Clear Channel Communications.  WNMB returned to its country music format on January 12, 2007. The station's studios are located on South Main Street in downtown Mocksville and its transmitter is located in Mount Airy.

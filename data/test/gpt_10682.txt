Seaport Square, or Boston Seaport is a historic district located in the North End of Boston, Massachusetts. It is bounded by Hanover Street to the north, Essex Street to the east, North End Avenue to the south, and Boston Harbor to the west. The district was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966.  The area now occupied by Seaport Square was originally a tidal marsh, which was filled in from the harbor beginning in the early 18th century. The first buildings were warehouses and wharfs, built by shipbuilders and merchants who depended on the harbor for their commerce. In the late 18th century, Seaport Square became one of the most fashionable neighborhoods in Boston, and many of its grand residential buildings were built in the Georgian style. The square was largely destroyed by fire in 1871, but was rebuilt almost immediately; today it is one of Boston's most popular tourist destinations.

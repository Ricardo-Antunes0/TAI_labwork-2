Tego film is an adhesive sheet, used in the printing and graphic arts industries, composed of two or more sheets of paper that are heat-sealed together along one edge. The adhesive is intended to attach the sheets together so that they can be cut down to a smaller size, or to create a finished product.  Tego film was invented in the early 1970s by Serge Teigo, and is now produced by several companies. It is most commonly used in the printing and graphic arts industries, where it is used for things such as cutting down large prints to desired sizes, creating covers for books, and adhering pages of magazines together.

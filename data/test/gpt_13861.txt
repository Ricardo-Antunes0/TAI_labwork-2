Anarchism is generally defined as the political philosophy that advocates the abolition of government and the institution of anarchist societies, characterized by self-governance and mutual aid.  Anarchism has been described as a revolutionary political ideology and social movement whose adherents oppose all forms of authority and domination,including state power, capitalism, feudalism, and patriarchy. Advocates believe in creating an egalitarian society without borders or rulers, based on the premise that people can be self-reliant and motivated by empathy and common interests.  Anarchism emerged in the late 18th century as a radical movement within the radical French Enlightenment. The first anarchist movements emerged in France and Spain, where they advocated for social equality, anti-capitalism, anti-imperialism, direct democracy, and voluntary association. In the early 19th century, anarchists began to develop ideas about how to achieve these goals through revolutionary action.  Since its inception, anarchism has faced criticism from many quarters for its radical ideals and lack of practicality. Anarchists rebut this by citing a number of successes in achieving some of their goals through nonviolent means, such as the abolition of slavery and women's suffrage.

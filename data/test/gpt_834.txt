"Reconciliation" was a war poem by Siegfried Sassoon, published in 1917. The poem describes the reconciliation of a soldier with his unit after he has returned home from the war. Sassoon wrote it in response to the death of his friend and fellow soldier, Wilfred Owen.  Sassoon's poem is often seen as a seminal work in the reconciliation movement, which seeks to bring together people who have been divided by war. It has been frequently anthologized and is widely read and studied.  In 1916, Sassoon was drafted into the British Army. He served in the Western Front for three years, witnessing the horrors of war first-hand. Upon his return home in 1917, Sassoon found that Owen had also died of influenza just two months after Sassoon had left for France. Sassoon wrote "Reconciliation" in tribute to his friend and to explore the many emotions that he felt upon his return.  The poem begins with a description of a soldier returning home from war:   He knows not what he brings back with him  Only memories of blood and pain  And a broken heart that cannot mend   But through these memories he must find  The strength to go on living

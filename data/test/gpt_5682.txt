The Clash of Civilizations is a thesis originally presented by Samuel P. Huntington in his book The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order. The thesis posits that there is a new global conflict that pits the Western world against the Islamic world, and that this conflict will eventually lead to the end of the Western world as we know it.  The Clash of Civilizations is a controversial thesis that has been subject to criticism from both sides of the ideological spectrum. Some critics argue that the thesis is outdated and does not reflect reality, while others argue that it provides a valuable perspective on the current global conflict.

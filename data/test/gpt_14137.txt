The Apollo Lyceus (, Apoll≈çn Lukeios) type, attributed to the sculptor Polykleitos, is a bronze sculpture of Apollo, with his right arm outstretched and holding a lyre. The statue is approximately life-sized, and probably dates to the 4th century BC.  The Lyceus type is one of the most famous and recognizable representations of Apollo. The statue is often compared in quality to the more famous Apollo Belvedere statue. The statue was found at the ancient city of Argos, and is now in the collection of the Vatican Museum.

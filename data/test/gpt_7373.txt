Gatsi  and Gaim (გაიმ; or Ga, გა) were two of the most powerful and influential lords of the Georgian kingdom of Iberia in the Middle Ages.  The two brothers ruled Iberia jointly from 770 to 811, and fought a long, bloody war against the Arabs, culminating in their victory at the Battle of Bagratashen in 809. After this victory, Gatsi and Gaim became undisputed masters of Iberia.  Gatsi was the elder brother and was a fierce and determined leader. He was also an able military strategist, and is credited with developing Georgian tactics during the wars with the Arabs. Gaim was his equal in terms of military ability and was equally skilled at ruling and managing their kingdom.  The brothers were also renowned for their generosity and benevolence. They built many churches and monasteries, and were responsible for bringing Christianity to Georgia. Gatsi and Gaim are also remembered for their poetry, which is considered some of the finest in Georgian literature.

Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is the native language of the Data Analysis Expressions (DAE) toolkit. It is a general-purpose programming language that enables concise and concise expression of data analysis algorithms.  DAX was designed to be concise and concise, while also enabling the expression of data analysis algorithms. This makes it a perfect tool for data scientists and engineers who need to quickly write code to solve problems. DAX is also well-suited for use in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.

Cyclonic Storm Nilam was the deadliest tropical cyclone in the history of India, and the eleventh deadliest tropical cyclone in the world. Originating from a low pressure area east of the Andaman Islands on October 12, 1998, Nilam quickly intensified into a severe cyclonic storm while tracking northwestward. By October 14, the storm had attained its peak intensity with winds reaching 230 kilometers per hour (145 mph). Shortly thereafter, Nilam began to undergo rapid weakening, and by October 16 it had degenerated into a severe tropical storm. The storm passed near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands on October 17 before dissipating over the Bay of Bengal on October 18.  Cyclone Nilam was one of the deadliest tropical cyclones on record in India, killing 2,226 people across nine states. The majority of deaths occurred in Andhra Pradesh, where 1,813 people were killed. In Tamil Nadu, 191 people were killed. In Kerala, 128 people were killed. In Orissa, 66 people were killed. In Uttar Pradesh, 35 people were killed. In Rajasthan, 10 people were killed. In Gujarat, two people were killed. The total number of fatalities is higher than any other tropical cyclone in Indian history.

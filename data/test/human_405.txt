The Sheibani Network is an Iraqi smuggling network and Shi'a Insurgent group led by Abu Mustafa al-Sheibani, an ex-commander of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq's Badr Brigades. The group is said to be used by Iran's Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force to supply Iraqi Special Groups. The group is alleged to be responsible for numerous attacks on Iraqi and Coalition forces. The network is said to consist of 280 members, divided in 17 units. US commanders have estimates that weapons smuggled and used by the group have been responsible for the death of 170 and injury of 600 American soldiers by February 2007. Abu Mustafa al-Sheibani himself is said to have fled to Tehran, Iran to evade capture, where he currently resides. History  After the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, ex-Badr commander Abu Mustafa al-Sheibani set up his own logistics, arms, and financing network using his connections with the Badr Organisation, which he also supplied. In January 2005 he was recruited by the Quds Force to supply the Muqtada al-Sadr's Jaish al-Mahdi (JAM) as well as a splinter group led by Qais al-Khazali: the Khazali Network, which would later become Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq (AAH). The Sheibani Network, via old Badr smuggling routes trafficked Explosively formed penetrators (EFPs), Improvised explosive devices (IEDs), 107mm rockets, 122mm rockets, Katyusha rockets, and a variety of mortars into Iraq. They also make bombs themselves. Next to weapons the group also smuggles money, designated for special groups, from Iran to Iraq and transports militiamen from other groups from Iraq to Iran and Lebanon to receive training.

Gotcha! The Sport! is a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System that was released in 1987. It uses the NES Zapper light gun and is a capture the flag-style game played with paintball guns loaded with simulated paintballs. The game was loosely based on the 1985 Universal Studios film Gotcha!, starring Anthony Edwards. The player's mission is to get through the level, capture the enemy flag by shooting it, and return it to their base. This is while simultaneously trying not to get shot by the other team, run out of ammo, or run out of time. A light gun is necessary for this game, but one needs to also use the controller. The directional pad will move the screen left and right. Ammo boxes can be found sitting on the ground or carried by enemies in the background. It seems that only misses cost the player ammo, so if one's aim is precise, they will receive a significant bonus for leftover ammunition.

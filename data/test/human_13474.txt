The National Art Library (NAL) is a major reference library, situated in the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A), a museum of decorative arts in London. It is freely accessible to the public from Tuesday to Saturday, and specialises in material about the fine and decorative arts of many countries and periods. It also contains substantial sources for information about artists. In the past, the NAL operated a restrictive admissions policy and was known as a library of last resort but that has since changed, as nowadays everyone is welcome to use the library and its collections. The NAL is located on the first floor of the museum, overlooking the John Madejski Garden. The library's subject coverage includes those central to the work of the V&A and its collections, including: prints, drawings and paintings; furniture and woodwork; textiles, dress and fashion; ceramics and glass; metalwork; sculpture; and art and design of the Far East, India and South East Asia. The library also functions as the V&A's curatorial department for the art, craft and design of the book which means that some books are collected as examples of book art, rather than as reference works.

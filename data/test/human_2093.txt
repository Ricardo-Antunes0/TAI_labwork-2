The Danville Meetinghouse (also known as The Hawke Meetinghouse) is a historic colonial meeting house on North Main Street (New Hampshire Route 111A) in Danville, New Hampshire. Construction on the building began in 1755 and was finished in 1760 when Danville (Hawke at the time) petitioned to form a town of its own, separate from Kingston. It is the oldest meetinghouse of original construction and least-altered in New Hampshire, with a remarkably well preserved interior.    The building, now maintained by a local nonprofit organization, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Danville Meetinghouse is located in a rural setting in northern Danville, on the east side of North Main Street.  It is a -story wood-frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior.  Entrances are located at the centers of the east, west, and south sides, with the principal entrance on the south.  It is framed by pilasters and a simple entablature.  The north wall has five bays, with the central one occupied by a pulpit window halfway between the two levels.  The interior retains original box pews, with a raised pulpit and reading desk at the center of the north wall.  The gallery level has slip pews, and a choir area on the south wall facing the pulpit.

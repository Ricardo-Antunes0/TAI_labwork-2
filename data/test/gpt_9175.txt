Self-experimentation refers to scientific experimentation in which the investigator performs the experiment themselves. It is a common practice in biomedicine and is especially common in research on novel therapies. It can also be used to investigate phenomena that are too difficult or too risky to study using traditional methods.  Self-experimentation can be valuable for two reasons. First, it allows investigators to avoid bias and optimize the experimental design for the data they are hoping to collect. Second, self-experimentation can help investigators to identify potential problems with their hypotheses or experiments early on, before they have invested too much time and resources into them.  There are several risks associated with self-experimentation, however. First, self-experimenters may not accurately reproduce the conditions under which the experiment was performed, which could lead to inaccurate results. Second, self-experimenters may be less likely to report negative results than positive results, which could lead to false confidence in the investigational hypothesis. Finally, self-experimentation can be difficult and time-consuming, which could lead to underpowered or overcomplicated experiments.  Despite these risks, self-experimentation is an important part of scientific discovery and is often vital for advancing novel therapies or investigating previously inaccessible phenomena.

Hull House was a settlement house in Chicago, Illinois, operated by the Social Settlement Association of Chicago from 1889 to 1974. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961.  Hull House was one of the first settlement houses in the United States and is considered one of the most influential. It provided social services to low-income Chicagoans for over fifty years, and played an important role in the city's development.  The house was founded by Mary E. Hull and her husband, George A. Hull. It was built in 1889 on the south side of Chicago, on what was then called Prairie Avenue (now Michigan Avenue). Hull House originally consisted of three rooms: a living room, a dining room, and a bedroom. It offered food, shelter, and vocational training to low-income people.  Over the years, Hull House became one of the largest settlement houses in the United States. It served as a center for social activism and helped to shape Chicago's history. In 1961, it was designated a National Historic Landmark. Today, Hull House is a museum operated by the Social Settlement Association of Chicago.

West End Eurovision is an annual fundraising event held in London between top West End shows, loosely based on the Eurovision Song Contest. It is generally held at the Piccadilly theatre and the host show does not compete but rather is the opening act before the main event. This event is done for the charity The Make A Difference Trust and the format is divided between three competitions, one for the best performance, one for best creativity and another for the best video ident. Each year a number of celebrity judges pick the winner of the Best Creative Award, while the Best Video Ident Award is chosen over social media.  The Best Performance Award is the biggest of the three and is awarded to the performance that gets the highest number of points combined from three categories: the best video ident points, phone votes from the audience (which are doubled) and points from the show representatives from each competing show. 2008  Debuting Shows: Avenue Q Buddy The Lion King Phantom of the Opera Mamma Mia!

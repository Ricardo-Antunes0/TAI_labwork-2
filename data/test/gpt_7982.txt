Four Loko is a line of alcoholic energy drinks manufactured by Phusion Projects and sold in the United States and Canada. The drink has been controversial, with reports of intoxication, crashes, and injuries.  Four Loko was created in 2003 by Phusion Projects, a beverage company based in Scotts Valley, California. The drink was designed to be less filling and more intoxicating than other energy drinks on the market at the time. It was initially marketed as a "party" drink, and was specifically designed to be consumed quickly.  Four Loko became highly popular among college students and young adults, and was eventually banned from sale in many areas due to its high levels of intoxication and crash risks. In April 2013, Phusion Projects filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after lawsuits were filed by consumers who claimed that Four Loko had caused them injuries. The company emerged from bankruptcy in December 2014.  Four Loko is composed of 40% alcohol by volume (ABV), making it legally classified as a distilled beverage in the United States and Canada. The drink's name is a play on the phrase "four leaf clover", which is associated with luck.

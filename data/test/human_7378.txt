Domenico ("Dominique") Pino (Milan, 8 September 1760 – Cernobbio, 29 March 1826) was an Italian soldier.  He served as General of Division in the Kingdom of Italy and in Napoleon's Grande Armée. Biography Pino was born in Milan, to Francesco and Margherita Lonati, a scion of a distinguished family.  He attended the Collegio Gallio in Como and joined the army of the Duchy of Parma, serving as a captain in the cavalry.  He enlisted as a grenadier in the Lombardy Legion, formed by Napoleon as part of his Army of Italy in October 1796.  Pino was promoted to command a battalion in the Legion only one month later.  He was promoted to colonel on 25 February 1797, to brigadier general on 16 December 1798, and to General of Division in 1800, the highest rank in the Legion. His rapid rise was due to his outstanding service in Napoleon's Army of Italy.  Captured at Ancona in 1799, he was released on his parole, and so missed the Battle of Marengo in 1800, but was recognised for his service in command of a division in the campaign in Tuscany in 1800 and 1801.  His younger brother, Giacomo Pino (born 1 October 1767) served him as an aide-de-camp.

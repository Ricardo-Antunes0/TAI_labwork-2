An elimination diet, also known as exclusion diets, is a diet plan that eliminates one or more food groups from the diet for a set period of time in order to determine which foods are causing symptoms. Once the food group(s) has been eliminated, the dieter can then add it back into the diet and see if any new symptoms arise.  Elimination diets are typically used in cases of food allergies or intolerances, as well as for people with cancer or other chronic illnesses who cannot have certain foods. They can also be used as a weight loss tool, by limiting the number of calories taken in from certain food groups.

Aikaterini Laskaridou (1842 â€“ 1916) was a prominent Greek feminist and social reformer. She is best known for her work on women's education and for campaigning for women's rights.  Aikaterini Laskaridou was born in 1842 in the town of Grevena in central Greece. She studied at the Athens National School of Fine Arts, where she became involved in the women's rights movement. In 1868, she founded the first female school in Greece, which provided education and a space for women to develop their own talents. Laskaridou also campaigned for women's suffrage, founding several organisations dedicated to this cause. She died in 1916.

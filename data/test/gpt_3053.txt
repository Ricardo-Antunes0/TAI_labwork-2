Reciprocity in electrical networks is a property of networks in which the power delivery is always equal and opposite. This property is used to maintain steady electrical loads in large networks.  Reciprocity can be used to prevent voltage swings in large networks, as well as to recover from transient events such as outages or overloads. In a network with reciprocity, the power delivered by each node is always equal and opposite. This means that if node A delivers power to node B, node B will then deliver power back to A in the same amount.  This property is important for maintaining steady electrical loads in large networks. If there were voltage swings in a network with reciprocity, it would be difficult for nodes to maintain a steady electrical load. Voltage swings can cause equipment to overheat or malfunction.  Reciprocity is also used to recover from transient events such as outages or overloads. If an outage occurs, for example, nodes in the network will be unable to deliver power to each other. With reciprocity, however, nodes will still be able to deliver power to other nodes in the network, so the electrical load at these nodes will be reduced. This allows the network to recover more quickly from an outage.

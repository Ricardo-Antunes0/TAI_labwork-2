is a town located in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. The town has a population of 58,919 and is the second-largest town in Kanagawa Prefecture. The town is also the center of the Ōi Peninsula.  Ōi was founded on April 1, 1720 as a settlement for samurai from the Izu region. The town's name is derived from the Oji River, which runs through the town. Ōi developed as a center for agriculture and commerce due to its location on the Tokaido Road. The town was hit hard by the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923 and was almost completely destroyed. However, thanks to the efforts of local residents, Ōi was rebuilt and has since become one of Japan's most popular tourist destinations.  Ōi has many attractions including the Ōi Castle, a Buddhist temple, and a variety of shops and restaurants. The town also has an extensive network of hiking trails that can be enjoyed by visitors of all levels of fitness.

RuneScape, sometimes referred to as RuneScape 3, is a massively multiplayer online role-playing video game developed and published by Jagex Ltd. It was released on 17 October 2001 in the United Kingdom, and on 22 December 2002 in the United States. The game is free-to-play, with players able to purchase items with real money. RuneScape is one of the most popular online games in the world, with over 250 million registered users.  RuneScape has been praised for its large and well-developed world, as well as its innovative features, such as allowing players to bank and trade in-game assets. The game has been banned or restricted in several countries, most notably China and Iran. In May 2018, Jagex announced that it would be ceasing development of RuneScape after 23 years due to increasing development costs and declining player numbers.

Periodic instantons are finite energy solutions of the Schr¨dinger equation that are stable against perturbations. They are found in the context of model Hamiltonians with Dirichlet boundary conditions, and can be used to describe many physical phenomena.  Periodic instantons are finite energy solutions of the Schr¨dinger equation that are stable against perturbations. They are found in the context of model Hamiltonians with Dirichlet boundary conditions, and can be used to describe many physical phenomena. In particular, they can be used to study the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a system, as well as the phase space structure around a fixed point.

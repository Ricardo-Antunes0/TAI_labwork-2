Gamma Arietis (γ Arietis, abbreviated Gamma Ari, γ Arietis), also named Algol, is an orange-hued star in the constellation Aries. With an apparent visual magnitude of 2.92, it is the brightest star in the night sky apart from Sirius and Canopus.  Gamma Arietis is a giant star that is about twice as massive as the Sun. It has swollen to about 150 times the Sun's diameter and is radiating 250 times the Sun's luminosity from its outer atmosphere. This stellar composition makes it a very unstable star, with a lifespan of only 10 million years. It is believed to be undergoing a rapid phase of evolution in which it will eventually consume its own gas and collapse into a white dwarf.

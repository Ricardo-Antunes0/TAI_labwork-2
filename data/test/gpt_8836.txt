Microblogging is an online broadcast medium that allows for short, public messages to be sent through a blog or web site. Bloggers who are using microblogging services can post updates about their own activities, share links, and add comments to other posts. Microblogging services also allow for the public to follow other bloggers' posts and access their archives.  Microblogging first emerged on the Internet in 2003 as a way for people to share short messages online. Early microblogging services allowed users to post messages that were limited to 140 characters. Since then, there has been a proliferation of microblogging services with new platforms and applications developed every year. As of July 2013, there were approximately 191 million active accounts on Twitter, 66 million active accounts on Tumblr, and 166 million active accounts on WordPress.  Microblogging is commonly used for personal communication, but it can also be used for social networking, news reporting, and broadcasting. Microblogging services are often used by reporters and bloggers to disseminate information quickly and interact with their readers/viewers. They are also used by businesses to communicate with their customers directly and by governments to communicate with their citizens.

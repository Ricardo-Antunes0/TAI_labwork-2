Geoarchaeology is a multi-disciplinary approach which uses archaeological data to study the spatial and temporal distribution of human-induced disturbances in the Earth's surface. It covers a range of research topics, from investigating how people have altered the landscape over time, to understanding the impact of natural disasters.  Geoarchaeology has become increasingly important in recent years as archaeological sites have been damaged or destroyed by natural events such as floods, earthquakes and volcanoes. By studying the physical evidence left behind by these events, researchers can learn more about how people have interacted with the environment over the course of history.   Geoarchaeology is a rapidly growing field, and there is still much to be learned about the way humans have affected the Earth over time. Researchers in this field are constantly developing new methods and techniques to help them better understand human interaction with the environment, and their findings have had a profound impact on our understanding of human history.

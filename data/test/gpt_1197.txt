The Vinegar Tree is an early play by William Shakespeare. The play is a romantic comedy about two young people, Viola and Sebastian, who are in love but cannot be together because of Sebastian's family obligations.   Shakespeare wrote the play in 1599 and it was first performed at the Globe Theatre on 19 April 1600. It is generally regarded as one of Shakespeare's weaker plays, but it has been popular ever since its debut.

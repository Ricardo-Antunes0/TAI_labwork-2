Distant View (9 May 1991 â€“ 12 June 2018) was an American-bred British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He raced only as a three-year-old in 1994 when he won twice and finished second twice in seven races. In the spring of that year he was beaten on his debut but showed promise when finishing fifth in the 2000 Guineas and then won a minor race on his next start. After a narrow defeat in the St James's Palace Stakes he recorded his biggest win when defeating a strong field of milers in the Group One Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. He was beaten in his next two races and was retired after being injured in 1995. He had considerable success as a breeding stallion before being retired from stud duty in 2006 and Died on 12 June 2018. Background Distant View was a chestnut horse with a white snip and a white sock on his left hind leg, bred in Kentucky by Juddmonte Farms, the breeding organisation of his owner Khalid Abdullah. He stood 15.3 hands high and was described as being "very strong behind the saddle, but with less than perfect forelegs". He was one of numerous important winners sired by the influential American stallion Mr. Prospector. Distant View's dam Seven Springs was a very fast and precocious racemare who won the Prix Robert Papin and the Prix Morny in 1984. She was a half-sister to Regal State, who also won the Prix Morny, and was the dam of the Dubai World Cup winner Pleasantly Perfect.

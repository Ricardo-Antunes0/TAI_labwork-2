The Popescu Prize is a biennial poetry award established in 1983. It is given by the Poetry Society for a volume of poetry translated from a European language into English. Formerly called the European Poetry Translation Prize (1983–1997), the prize was relaunched in 2003, renamed in memory of the Romanian translator Corneliu M. Popescu, who died at age 19 in 1977 and was known as the Corneliu M Popescu Prize that year and in 2005. Popescu translated the work of one of Romania's leading poets, Mihai Eminescu, into English. The prize of £1,500 is awarded to a translator. Financial support has been provided by the Ratiu Foundation since 2003 (the Foundation was established in London in 1979 by Ion and Elisabeth Ratiu to promote and support projects which further education and research in the culture and history of Romania). The Encyclopedia of Literary Translation into English (2000) considered the European Poetry Translation Prize one of the most "prestigious" translation awards.

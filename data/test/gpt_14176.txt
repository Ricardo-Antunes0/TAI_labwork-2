The Wakefield Trust Company is a historic bank building located at Wakefield, Massachusetts. The two-story, neoclassical granite and marble building was designed by architect George F. Richardson and built in 1887. The bank is significant as one of the few surviving examples of Richardson's work in the Pioneer Valley.  The Wakefield Trust Company was founded in 1887 and was one of the first banks in the Pioneer Valley. It was known for its innovative banking practices, including the use of automatic teller machines (ATMs). The bank closed in 2001 due to the effects of the 2001 recession. It was later reopened as a branch of Citizens Bank.

Sigmund von Haimhausen (28 December 1708 – 5 December 1784) was a German writer, dramatist and librettist. He is best known for his novel Der Teufel und der Bismarck (The Devil and Bismarck), the last great novel in the Romantic tradition.  Haimhausen was born in Helmstadt, then in the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. After studying law at the University of Göttingen, he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1730. He began his career as an advocate but soon turned to writing, producing dramas, comedies and libretti, as well as a series of historical novels, including Die Jüdin von Malta (The Jew of Malta), Die Schlacht bei Jena (The Battle of Jena) and Der Teufel und der Bismarck (The Devil and Bismarck).

The Grêmio Recreativo Escola de Samba Império Serrano is a samba school of the city of Rio de Janeiro, that was created on March 23 of 1947 after a disagreement of the extinct samba school Prazer da Serrinha. It was nine times champion of the Carnaval and can be considered one of the most traditional schools of the samba of the city. One of the principal vainglories of its members is the open democracy of the school, established in the school's foundation. Its history is normally confused with the history of the Morro da Serrinha, despite its headquarters being in Avenida Ministro Edgard Romero near the Estação Mercadão de Madureira, but in the same neighborhood: Madureira. The Ala de Compositores (Ala of the Composers) of Império is one of the most respected, having in its history people such as Silas de Oliveira, Mano Décio, Aniceto do Império, Molequinho, Dona Ivone Lara (first woman to participate in the ala of the composers of the samba schools), Beto sem Braço, Aluizio Machado, and Arlindo Cruz.

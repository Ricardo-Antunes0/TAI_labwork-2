In general, kung fu/kungfu ( or ; Cantonese Yale Gung fu) refers to any form of Chinese martial arts, especially those that emphasize hand-to-hand combat. The term can also refer to the associated philosophy, culture and tradition.  Kung fu is derived from the Cantonese word gung fu (), which is composed of the two words gung (勁) meaning "strength" or "power" and fu (功) meaning "skill". Thus, gung fu literally means "skill in strength", and refers to the physical and mental discipline required to master kung fu.  The term kung fu has been used throughout history and is sometimes used as a blanket term for all Chinese martial arts. However, it is more typically used for the martial art of Shaolin Kung Fu, which is the most renowned and well-known form of kung fu. Other forms of kung fu include tai chi chuan, qigong, and Wuji Quan.

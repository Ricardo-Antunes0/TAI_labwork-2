A shopping mall (or simply mall) is a large, dedicated shopping area or complex. Most were originally built in the mid-20th century in the United States and Canada, as a way to provide affordable shopping opportunities for the middle and working classes. They now exist in almost every country and many cities around the world.  Malls vary in size, but generally have a large number of shops, often with several floors of enclosed stores, a cinema, and often a food court or other amenities. In some cases, they also have high-end stores, restaurants, and other features not found in traditional shopping districts. Large shopping malls are sometimes called "superstores", "megamalls", or "supercenters".  The first mall was opened in Kansas City, Missouri by developer D.W. Griffith in 1922. By the early 21st century, there were more than 5,000 malls worldwide comprising over 1,000 different stores. Many malls are owned by real estate developers who also operate other commercial properties such as office buildings or hotels.

The Lads Society is a far-right white nationalist group in the United Kingdom. It was founded in the early 1980s by Colin Jordan and Paul Golding, both former members of the neo-Nazi National Front.  The group is best known for its campaigns against Islam and immigrants, and for its support of the English Defence League. In 2017, it was banned from participating in any electoral activity in the UK.

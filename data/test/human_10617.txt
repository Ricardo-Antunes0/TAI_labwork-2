The Tarakan riot was an ethnic riot which occurred between September 27 and September 29, 2010 in the city of Tarakan, North Kalimantan, Indonesia. The riot pitched native Tidung people against Bugis migrants. It was triggered by the death of a Tidung elder in a scuffle with a youth gang. During the ensuing riot four people were killed and thousands of civilians were displaced, before a peace agreement was made between the communities. Background Tarakan, located on Tarakan Island, is one of the major cities in eastern Borneo (now Northern Borneo). It had a population of 178,111 in 2008. Native residents are the Tidung, a subgroup of the Dayak people. The city also has a multi-ethnic population from other parts of Indonesia, such as Bugis, Javanese and Chinese Indonesians.    The Tidung are a group of Malayised Dayak people who live in the north-eastern part of Borneo and surrounding small islands. They live on both sides of the border of Malaysia and Indonesia. They are closely related to other native people in Sabah and East Kalimantan, such as the Murut people. Tidung speak Tidong language, one of the North Bornean languages.

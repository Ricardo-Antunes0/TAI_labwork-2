Football is the most popular sport in Angola. It is played mainly by men, although both women and children play football. The sport is considered a national sport and is often referred to as "o futebol angolano" (the Angolan football). Football can be traced back to the 19th century.  Football in Angola is governed by the Angolan Football Federation which was founded in 1924. The federation organizes the national football league, the Angolan Cup, and the African Champions League. The national team has qualified for the FIFA World Cup four times, most recently in 2010.

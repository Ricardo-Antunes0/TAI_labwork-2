On 2 February 2020 two people were stabbed at a bus stop in Streatham, southeast London. The attacker, later identified as Iftikhar Mohammed, was found dead at the scene.   The stabbing raised fears of a surge in knife crime and the London Mayor Sadiq Khan called for an emergency meeting of the London police board to discuss what he termed "a public safety crisis".

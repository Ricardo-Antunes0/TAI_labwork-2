Composition The song was written and recorded in the key of A major. Jason Shadrick of music magazine Premier Guitar notes a Derek and the Dominos style opening guitar riff and gospel-influenced chorus. Ultimate Classic Rock critic Billy Dukes called the title an "inspired jam [and] arrangement sounds like a classic blues [with] thick Fender and Hammond" sound. Dukes goes on in his analysis noting "Clapton finds a little gravel in his delivery as the guitarist takes the song over after 30 seconds". The critic also notes a "playfully soloing" by Clapton after the second verse finished. Finishing his review of the song, Dukes recalls the "stable rhythm section" and "funky guitar and organ lick providing a framework for him to frolic on top of". The track features backing vocals by Chaka Khan.

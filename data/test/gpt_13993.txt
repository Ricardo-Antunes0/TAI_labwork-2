The Spemann-Mangold organizer is a group of transcription factors that are responsible for the regulation of gene expression. The Spemann-Mangold organizer is found in a variety of eukaryotic cells, including neurons, and is thought to be involved in the organization and function of these cells.  The Spemann-Mangold organizer was first identified by two German scientists, Walther Spemann and Erwin Mangold, in 1935. Spemann and Mangold were working on a project investigating the origins of hereditary traits in cells when they discovered that certain genes were being regulated in different ways depending on where they were located within the cells. They identified a group of proteins called transcription factors, which were responsible for regulating these genes.  Since its discovery, the Spemann-Mangold organizer has been extensively studied and has been found to be involved in a variety of cell functions. These include the regulation of gene expression, the organization of cells, and the maintenance of cell viability. The Spemann-Mangold organizer is also thought to play a role in the development of cells.

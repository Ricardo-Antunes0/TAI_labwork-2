Hurricane Pali was the earliest-forming Pacific hurricane on record. Forming on August 24, 1979, Pali was a weak storm that rapidly intensified into a Category 1 hurricane only twelve hours after becoming a tropical depression. After making landfall in Hawaii on August 25, Pali rapidly weakened and was absorbed by an extratropical cyclone on August 28.  Pali is the first known Pacific hurricane to form in the month of August, and the earliest-forming Pacific hurricane on record. The storm is also the earliest recorded Category 1 hurricane on record in the Eastern Pacific basin. At peak intensity, Pali is estimated to have had winds of 155 mph (250 km/h), making it a moderately strong storm. However, Pali's winds were significantly reduced due to its short duration – only twelve hours after becoming a tropical depression. After landfall in Hawaii, Pali rapidly weakened and was absorbed by an extratropical cyclone on August 28.

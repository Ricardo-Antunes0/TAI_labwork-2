Royal Artillery (RA) Park, a military installation near Hounslow in the London Borough of Hounslow, England, is the home of the Royal Artillery and the Royal Horse Artillery. The park covers an area of 4,500 acres and includes artillery ranges, an assault course, a training centre and accommodation for up to 1,500 troops.  The park was originally established in 1795 as a training ground for gunners. In 1859 it became home to the Royal Horse Artillery and in 1907 it was transferred to the Royal Artillery. Today it is one of the busiest military training areas in Europe and is home to the UK's only armoured regiment, 3rd Battalion The Rifles.

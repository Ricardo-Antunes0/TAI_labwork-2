Project Daedalus (named after Daedalus, the Greek architect and engineer who designed the first man-carrying flying machine) was a British secret project during World War II to develop an advanced airborne weapons system.  The project was initiated in 1940, under the leadership of Sir Hugh Trenchard, and was one of the most ambitious and complex wartime projects undertaken in Britain. Its aim was to develop a manned flying machine that could be used as a weapon, and it ran for over two years until its abandonment in 1943.  The project's main goals were to develop an aircraft that could fly at high speeds and heights, and that could carry a payload of explosives or a nuclear weapon. It was also hoped that the aircraft could be used as a reconnaissance platform, and that it could be controlled from a remote location.  Despite its promising beginnings, Project Daedalus ultimately failed to meet its objectives. The aircraft never reached production stage, and the project was abandoned in 1943 due to lack of funding and technical feasibility.

Wharncliffe Crags is a gritstone escarpment or cliff in the Peak District, England. It is the most northerly of the three gritstone outcrops which form the Yorkshire Dales, and is situated about 2 miles (3.2 km) south-west of Pen-y-Ghent, near the A628 road. The crags are named after George Wharncliffe, who owned a quarry on the site in the early 19th century.  The crags are composed of Upper and Lower Gritstone, and are part of the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The cliffs are popular with climbers and walkers, and are a Site of Special Scientific Interest because of their geological and botanical features.

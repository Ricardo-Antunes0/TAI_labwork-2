The Foreman–Roberts House, formerly the James D. Roberts House, is a historic house located at 207 E. Main Street in downtown Wheeling, West Virginia. The 2-story, five bay, Federal style brick dwelling was built in 1821 for James D. Roberts, a prominent local lawyer and judge. The house was purchased by the Foreman family in 1905 and is now operated as a bed and breakfast.  The Foreman–Roberts House is significant for its association with Wheeling's early legal and political history. Judge Roberts, one of the city's most prominent citizens, was instrumental in the city's early development and served as its first mayor. The house is also notable for its architecture, which features Federal style features such as the pedimented gable roof and symmetrical facade.

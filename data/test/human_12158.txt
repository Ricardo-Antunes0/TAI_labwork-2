Procedural records are the set of constituent parts of a judicial process or administrative process, such as the petitions, terms of hearing, certificates, among others. Traditionally, they have always been in physical format, but with the advent of the electronic process, they have gradually been replaced by records in electronic format. The physical records are made up of a jumble of papers, which are held together by staples, plastic tracks, or brackets ("ballerinas" for holding paper), and which usually have a cover. In these volumes of papers, the acts of each process are recorded. The records are worked on by civil servants, usually from the judiciary, but also from other branches of government, in the case of administrative proceedings. The parties, or their lawyers, have access to view them, and sometimes, the latter can remove them from the custody of the state for a certain period of time, committing to return them intact. Every procedural act, even in physical processes, is usually registered in an electronic system, for better monitoring. Eventually, if the physical records are lost, they can be reconstituted by means of copies of the fundamental documents.

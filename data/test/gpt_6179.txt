Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs; ) are a group of genetic diseases that result from defects in the lysosomes, organelles in the cell that digest and destroy damaged or unwanted proteins. LSDs are caused by mutations in genes that encode for lysosomal proteins, and can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive manner.  LSDs are characterized by the accumulation of defective or dysfunctional lysosomes in various tissues, leading to the disease's name. Symptoms typically develop during infancy or early childhood and may include seizures, developmental delays, failure to thrive, muscle weakness, and liver failure. Some LSDs are fatal within a few years of birth, while others may not become apparent until late adulthood or even adulthood. There is currently no cure for LSDs, but many of them can be treated with a combination of medications and supportive care.

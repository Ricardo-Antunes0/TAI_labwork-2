Zhenzhu Khan (Inchü Qaghan, ) (died October 12, 1227) was a Mongol general and the third khan of the Ilkhanate. He was also the founder of the Yuan dynasty.  In 1212, Zhenzhu defeated and killed his elder brother, Kublai Khan, who had been the Ilkhanate's nominal ruler for about ten years. Kublai's death created a power struggle for control of the Ilkhanate among Zhenzhu Khan, his younger brother Ariq Böke, and their father, Abaqa Khan. Zhenzhu emerged victorious in this struggle and became the third Ilkhan ruler in 1218.  During his reign, he expanded the Mongol Empire westward by defeating the Khwarazmian Empire and occupying its capital, Khwarezm. In 1227, he was assassinated by a group of followers of his younger brother Ariq Böke.

Thihapate of Sagaing (, ; also Minbyauk Thihapate, Minbyaok Tīhapate, Minbyaok Theihapate, Myinbyaok Theihapate, and Myinbyaok Thihapate) (circa 1450–1525) was a king of the Pagan Dynasty of Burma who ruled from 1490 to 1525. He is most remembered for his military campaigns against the Shan States, which eventually led to the Burmese annexation of those territories.  Thihapate was born circa 1450 in Sagaing as the eldest son of King Thado Minbya and Queen Saw Maung. He ascended to the throne in 1490 after his father's death. In 1505, he married a niece of King Mingyi U of Toungoo, and in 1525 he died in a hunting accident near Prome. He was succeeded by his son Minye Kyawhti.

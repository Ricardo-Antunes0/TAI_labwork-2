Gu Ruzhang or Ku Yu-cheung (; 1894–1952) was a Chinese martial artist who disseminated the Bak Siu Lum (Northern Shaolin) martial arts system across southern China in the early 20th century. Gu was known for his expertise in Iron Palm hand conditioning among other Chinese martial art training exercises. He has become a legendary heroic figure in some Chinese martial arts communities. Gu was a son of Gu Lizhi , an adept of Tantui and Zhaquan and security and escort businessman (at the time, a common business for martial artists in China). Gu Yu-jeung inherited by his father's colleague Yán Jīwēn aka  嚴繼溫 the 10 North Shaolin routines, several weapon routines, and martial qigong techniques such as Iron Palm, Iron Body and Golden Bell. By such skills he was selected by the Central Guoshu Institute to teach Northern martial arts to the South as one of the "Five Southbound Tigers".

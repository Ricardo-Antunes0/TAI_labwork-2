Mycena haematopus, commonly known as the bleeding mycena, is a small to medium-sized fungus found in the Northern Hemisphere. It is a saprobic species that grows on the wood of deciduous trees and can cause bleeding on the surface of the wood if it grows in high concentrations. The bleeding mycena has been used in traditional medicine to treat various ailments, such as wounds, sore throats, and skin infections.

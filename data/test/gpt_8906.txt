La Spagna (English: "Spain"), also called La Hispaniola (English: "The Hispaniola"), is a country in Europe, located in the Iberian Peninsula on the Atlantic Ocean. Spanning an area of 7,787 km2 (3,963 sq mi), it has a population of almost 40 million people.  The capital and largest city is Madrid. Other major urban areas include Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Bilbao and MÃ¡laga. The country's official language is Spanish.  La Spagna is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system, headed by a prime minister who is the head of government. The king or queen regnant is the head of state, but their role is largely ceremonial. The current monarch is Felipe VI.   The roots of La Spagna lie in the Iberian Peninsula, which was settled by the Celts in the 4th century BC. In the 2nd century BC, the Romans conquered the peninsula and made it part of the province of Hispania Baetica. In 1492, King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile united La Spagna under a single monarchy. La Spagna joined the European Union in 1986 and has been a member state since 1995.

Typhoon Clara, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Lawin, was a powerful typhoon that affected the Philippines in September 1981. The storm developed on September 9 from a tropical depression that formed over the South China Sea. It rapidly intensified into a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale before making landfall on the island of Luzon on September 13 as a powerful Category 4 storm. Clara continued to strengthen while moving over the central Philippines, becoming a Category 5 super typhoon on the SSHWS before making another landfall on Samar on September 16. The storm quickly dissipated over land, leaving significant damage and at least 115 fatalities.  Clara was one of the most intense typhoons to affect the Philippines in history, and is one of only two typhoons to ever make landfall as a Category 5 super typhoon on both Luzon and Samar. The other was Typhoon Haiyan, which made landfall as a Category 5 super typhoon in the Philippines in November 2013. Clara also remains one of only two storms ever recorded to have killed over 100 people in both its Luzon and Samar landfalling phases, the other being Typhoon Genevieve in 1996. Overall, Clara caused $2.5 billion (1981 USD) in damage, making it one of the deadliest and most destructive storms in Philippine history.

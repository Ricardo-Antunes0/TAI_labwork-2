A control car, cab car (US and Canada), control trailer, or driving trailer (UK and Ireland) is a generic term for a non-powered railroad (US) or railway (UIC) vehicle that can control operation of a train at the end, opposite to the position of the locomotive. They can be used with diesel or electric motive power, allowing push-pull operation without the use of an additional locomotive. They can also be used with a power car or a railcar. In a few cases control cars were used with steam locomotives, especially in Germany and France (see article Voiture État à 2 étages). In the United States and Canada, cab cars are control cars similar to regular passenger cars, but with a full driver's compartment built into one or both ends. They can be very similar to regular rail cars, to the point of including a gangway between cars so that they could be used in the middle of a passenger train like a regular car if necessary. European railways have used such equipment since the 1920s. In the United States they appeared for the first time in the 1960s. In the United Kingdom, driving trailers may have one or two driving cabs.

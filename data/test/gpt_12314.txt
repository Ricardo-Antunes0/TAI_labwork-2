Blowback is a term originating from within the intelligence community, referring to the unintended consequences of covert operations or intelligence gathering.  Blowback can take a number of different forms, including the release of classified information, the recruitment of spies by rival agencies, and the undermining of authority figures by intelligence leaks. It is often difficult to predict and prevent, and can have serious consequences for both the intelligence community and its targets.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a long-term neuromuscular disorder caused by a deficiency or absence of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. MG is classified as an autoimmune disease, meaning that the body's own immune system attacks and damages the cells that produce acetylcholine. Symptoms of MG can vary widely and may include muscle weakness, difficulty speaking, swallowing, or breathing, and even paralysis. There is no known cure for MG, but treatments can help manage symptoms.

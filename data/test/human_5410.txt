Caleana dixonii, commonly known as the sandplain duck orchid is a rare species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has a single smooth leaf and a single greenish yellow and fawn-coloured flower. It is distinguished by its flattened labellum with calli only near the tip of the labellum and its preference for growing on sandplains. Description  Caleana dixonii has a single smooth, dull green to dull red leaf,  long and  wide. The leaf is usually withered by flowering time. Usually only one greenish-yellow and fawn-coloured flower,  long and  wide is borne on a flowering stem  high. The dorsal sepal, lateral sepals and petals are narrow and hang downwards with the dorsal sepal pressed against the column which has broad wings, forming a bucket-like shape. About one-third of the outer part of the labellum is covered with glossy black glands or calli and the labellum has a flattened top. Flowering occurs from late October to early December.

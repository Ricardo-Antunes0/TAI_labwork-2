sfGirl.com was an online community founded by Joanna Robinson in 1999 as a way for fans of science fiction, fantasy, and all things geek to connect and share information. The website quickly became known as a premier source for news, commentary, and fan art related to the genre.  In addition to its updated news and discussion forums, sfGirl.com was also home to the popular SF/F column "The Letters," written by Robinson and featuring original letters from fans. The column ran for over thirteen years and was one of the site's most popular features.  Throughout its history, sfGirl.com has been a vital part of the online community of science fiction, fantasy, and geek culture enthusiasts. Thanks for being a part of it!

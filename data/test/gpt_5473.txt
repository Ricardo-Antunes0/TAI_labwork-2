Karlheinz Stockhausen (; 22 August 1928 – 6 July 2007) was a German composer, musician, and conductor. He is considered one of the most influential and radical composers of the 20th century. His work spans over many musical genres, including classical music, electronic music, and new music.  Born in Munich, Stockhausen studied with Arnold Schoenberg and Kurt Weill at the Berliner Hochschule für Musik (now the Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe), where he began to experiment with electronic music. After World War II, he worked in various radio stations before becoming a senior staff member at the Düsseldorf Radio Symphony Orchestra in 1952. From 1957 to 1962, he was director of the Academy for Contemporary Music in Cologne. In 1969, he founded his own festival, the Interdisciplinary Festival Karlheinz Stockhausen, which ran until his death.  Stockhausen's works are characterized by their often extreme chromaticism and aleatoric elements. His most famous works include the opera "Krautrope" (1966), the orchestral work "Licht" (1962), and the sonic installations "Stimmung" (1962), "Dienstag aus Licht" (1969), and "Klavierstück I" (1971). He was awarded the British Composer Award in 1978 and the German Composer Award in 1990.

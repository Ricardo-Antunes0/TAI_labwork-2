WWFW is an FM radio station located in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The station operates on the FM radio frequency of 103.9Â MHz. In March 2014, Adams Radio Group entered an agreement to purchase Summit City's cluster (which includes WXKE). Days later, Adams announced they would purchase Oasis Radio Group's stations. To meet ownership limits, Adams would retain WNHT, WGL and the then-WXKE, as well as acquiring Oasis Radio Group's WJFX and WBTU, while selling off WHPP to Fort Wayne Catholic Radio, and selling WGL-FM to Calvary Radio Network. WLYV and two translators (on 96.9 FM and 103.3 FM) would also be acquired by Adams. The transaction, at a price of $6.4 million, was consummated on June 2, 2014. As a result, Adams planned on massive format restructuring. On June 2, Adams announced that WXKE would move to the stronger 96.3 signal, displacing WNHT's Rhythmic Contemporary format. The two stations would simulcast for ten days.

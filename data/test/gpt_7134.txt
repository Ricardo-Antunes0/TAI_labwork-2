Advanced Research for passive Thermal Exchange (ARTE) technology is a promising and novel approach to heat and cooling that is based on the principles of thermodynamics.  ARTE is a passive thermal exchange technology that uses the principles of thermodynamics to transfer thermal energy between two or more bodies. This technology can be used to transfer thermal energy between two or more objects within a system, or between a system and the environment.  ARTE has many potential applications. One application is in the cooling of electronic devices. ARTE can also be used to cool large systems, such as power plants or factories.

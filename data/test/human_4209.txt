TNA Today was an online professional wrestling program produced by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), now known as Impact Wrestling. It was hosted by interviewer Jeremy Borash, with occasional appearances by Don West. The show purported to feature "exclusive footage, interviews, previews, reviews, news updates, merchandise deals and more," and was, in fact, used as a supplement to TNA's main program, Impact Wrestling, and was used to further angles, debut wrestlers, and advertise merchandising deals (generally good for one day). History Before the debut of TNA Today, TNA had a number of other internet exclusive shows, including TNA Global Impact! and audio only podcasts. In 2007, the company debuted "Hot News Updates" on their websites, which eventually came together as TNA Today. The show is mostly hosted on YouTube, though for a short time the TNA account was suspended for unspecified reasons and the show was uploaded to MySpace TV until the suspension was lifted.

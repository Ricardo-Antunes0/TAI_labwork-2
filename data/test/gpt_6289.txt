HMS Inglefield was an  leader built by Swan Hunter in 1951. Inglefield was the last ship to be built using the traditional construction methods of half-inch steel plates riveted together. She was also the first British warship to be fitted with a helicopter deck.  Inglefield served in the Royal Navy for over 30 years, during which time she participated in many operations across the world. She played a major role during the Falklands War, and was also deployed to support the United States during the Gulf War. In 2002, Inglefield was decommissioned and sold for scrap.

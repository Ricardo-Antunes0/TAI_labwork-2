Current sense amplifiers (also called current shunt amplifiers) are devices that amplify the current flowing through them. They are mainly used in electric vehicle charging systems, to boost the current from a low-voltage source (usually a automobile battery) up to a higher voltage required by an electric vehicle charger.  Current sense amplifiers are also used in power supply systems to boost the current going into an inductor or transformer, so that it can provide more power than is available from the source.

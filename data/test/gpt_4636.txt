David Dale (6 January 1739â€“7 March 1806) was an English surgeon and anatomist.  David Dale was born in 1739 in the town of Middleton-in-Teesdale, County Durham, England, the son of a farmer. After completing his basic education, Dale became apprenticed to a surgeon in Newcastle. In 1760 he moved to London, where he continued his surgical training under Sir John Floyer.   Dale was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1768. He served as its president from 1792 to 1793. In 1792 he was appointed Regius Professor of Anatomy at Cambridge University, a post he held until his death in 1806.  Dale is most noted for his work in anatomy and for his contributions to surgery. He is credited with being the first to use ether as an anesthetic and for developing the craniotomy procedure for treating hydrocephalus. He also made significant contributions to the understanding of blood circulation and the function of the liver.  Dale was buried in Cambridge Cemetery.

Hermann Bartels (14 April 1900 in Minden, Westphalia – 2 September 1973 in Berlin) was a German mathematician who made significant contributions to the theory of probability and statistics, in particular through his work on error measures and their properties.  Bartels received his doctorate from the University of Göttingen in 1927 with a thesis entitled "Zur Theorie der Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie". He then moved to the University of Berlin, where he became a professor in 1939. In 1944 he was deported to forced labour in the Soviet Union, but he was ultimately released and returned to Berlin in 1948. He died there in 1973.  Bartels is best known for his work on error measures, which has had a lasting impact on both probability and statistics. In particular, he developed the concepts of error probability, error measure, and mutual information. He also made significant contributions to the theory of Bayesian inference and to stochastic processes.

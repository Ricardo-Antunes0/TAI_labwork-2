SES-14 is a geostationary communications satellite operated by SES. It was originally built as a Eurostar E3000 satellite, but has been extensively re-engineered and refurbished by Airbus Defence and Space. The satellite is based on the Eurostar E3000 platform, but with a new solar array and power system, as well as new antennas. It is designed to provide high-capacity communications services to fixed and mobile customers across Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  The SES-14 satellite was launched on 25 February 2017 by Arianespace from Kourou, French Guiana. The launch was successful, with the satellite entering a preliminary orbit. The satellite was subsequently tested and prepared for operational use.

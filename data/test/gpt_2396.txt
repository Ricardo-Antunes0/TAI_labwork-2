Project Magnet was an unidentified flying object (UFO) research project conducted by the United States Air Force from 1952 to 1969.  The project was headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, and was focused on investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs) using scientific methods. Project Magnet was the largest and most extensive UFO investigation effort in American history.  During its nine-year existence, Project Magnet compiled a database of reported sightings and investigated over 1,000 cases. However, despite extensive efforts, the project was unable to identify the objects or explain their behavior. Some theories suggest that Project Magnet may have been involved in the phenomenon of unidentified flying objects.

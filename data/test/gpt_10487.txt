Shocking Blue was a Dutch rock band that enjoyed international success during the 1970s.  Formed in 1967 in Amsterdam, Netherlands, Shocking Blue was one of the leading Dutch hard rock bands of the 1970s. The band's sound combined blues rock with heavy metal influences, and they became known for their energetic live performances. Shocking Blue's debut album, released in 1972, was a major success in the Netherlands, and they toured Europe extensively to promote it. Their following two albums also achieved moderate commercial success, and the group released several successful singles.  In 1978, Shocking Blue parted ways with their longtime record label and embarked on a successful tour of Japan. However, the band's popularity had begun to decline by the early 1980s, and they disbanded in 1984. Following their disbandment, several members went on to pursue separate careers in music.

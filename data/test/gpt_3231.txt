A Far Cry is a Boston-based chamber music ensemble consisting of cello, violin, viola, and bass. Formed in 2003, the ensemble has since released two critically acclaimed recordings on Nonesuch Records.  Founded by cellist Julia Wolfe and violinist Daniel Hope, A Far Cry is devoted to the exploration of contemporary chamber music repertoire. The ensemble's inaugural release, the self-titled A Far Cry, featured music by composers including Steve Reich, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and John Adams. Since then, the group has embarked on a series of highly acclaimed collaborations with leading contemporary artists including Kronos Quartet's David Harrington, violist Sarah Connolly, and bassist Edgar Meyer.  A Far Cry is also a regular presenter at major international festivals including Ravinia Festival, Tanglewood Music Center, and North American Recital Series (NARS) at the Kennedy Center. The ensemble has made frequent appearances on national radio broadcasts including BBC's New Year's Eve concert and All Things Considered.

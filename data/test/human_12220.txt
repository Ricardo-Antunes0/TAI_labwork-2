Albert Heinrich Riise (11 September 1810 – 18 October 1882), often referred to as A. H. Riise, was a Danish pharmacist, merchant and manufacturer of rum on Saint Thomas in the Danish West Indies. A brand of rum is still named A.H. Riise after him. Late in his life he returned to Denmark, where Sankt Thomas Plads (St. Thomas Square) in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen is named after his former country house. He was the father of photographer Frederik Riise. Early life and education Riise was the son of skipper and merchant Jens Christian Riise (1773-1814) and wife Margrethe Elisabeth Krabbe (1779-1869). The father died at sea when his ship accidentally perished a storm. After schooling, Albert was apprenticed at the pharmacist in Ærøskøbing and from 1825 to 1830 he continued at the pharmacist in Fåborg. He then traveled to Copenhagen, where he graduated in 1832. While still studying botany and chemistry, he worked at various pharmacies in the capital at the same time.

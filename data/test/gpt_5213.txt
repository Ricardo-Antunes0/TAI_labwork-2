The Washington Jockey Club was an American Thoroughbred horse racing organization that operated from 1892 to 1915.  The Washington Jockey Club was founded in 1892 by George E. Roberts and James J. Hill, two of the most powerful businessmen in the United States. The club was based in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., and its first race was a one-mile event for horses aged three years and over. The club's first president was John F. Fitzgerald.  The Washington Jockey Club was one of the most successful horse racing organizations in the United States. It operated at a time when horse racing was enormously popular, and it staged some of the most prestigious races in North America. Among the races run by the Washington Jockey Club were the Preakness Stakes, Belmont Stakes, and Saratoga Race Course's triple crown race, the Belmont Stakes.  The Washington Jockey Club closed its doors in 1915 due to competition from other racing organizations.

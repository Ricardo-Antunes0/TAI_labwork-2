Plot Viswanathan is the timid husband of Meena, a small-time artist. Viswanathan’s friend Ramamoorthy, along with his wife Shenbagam, go from their village to Chennai with the hopes of becoming a movie director. Ramamoorthy and Shenbagam stay in Viswanathan’s home. While Meena is away for a few days for shooting, Viswanathan discovers that his uncle has died with a will of Rs. 30 lakhs written in favour of Viswanathan. However, there is a check in the will that the money should be granted to Viswanathan only if Meena behaves well with Viswanathan. There comes Kathavarayan, Viswanathan’s uncle’s manager (who is in charge of the money) and his daughter Andal. As Meena is away for shooting, Ramamoorthy comes up with a plan. Ramamoorthy requests Shenbagam to act as Meena in front of Kathavarayan, so that he develops confidence and hands over the money. Meanwhile, Andal gets attracted towards Ramamoorthy, believing him to be the man who comes in her dreams often. Meena is cheated by her manager and is in financial distress. She gets back to her home and is shocked to see Shenbagam acting as her. However, Meena agrees for the plan as she is also in need of money. After many funny incidents, Kathavarayan gives the money to Viswanathan as Meena has transformed into a caring wife now. Viswanathan also decides to produce a movie to be directed by Ramamoorthy as a token of thanks.

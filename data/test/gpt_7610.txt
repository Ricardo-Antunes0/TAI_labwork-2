Birdsong was a temporary radio channel which broadcast music from birds between 2006 and 2007 on BBC Radio 2. The channel was created by BBC Radio 2's controller, Zane Lowe, who said that he wanted to "give people a new way to experience music" and that the channel would be "a celebration of the natural world".   The majority of the music on Birdsong was sourced from bird songs that had been recorded by ornithologists around the world. The station was broadcast for a total of twelve months, from 6am to 7am on weekdays. In 2007, BBC Radio 2 decided not to renew Birdsong's licence.

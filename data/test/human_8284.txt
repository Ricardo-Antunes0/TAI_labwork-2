Munjor is an unincorporated community in Wheatland Township, Ellis County, Kansas, United States.  As of the 2020 census, the population of the community and nearby areas was 232. History The Munjor community was one of six settlements founded in 1876 by Volga German immigrants from Russia. Their German ancestors had immigrated to the Volga Region of Russia around 1767 at the invitation of Catherine the Great in 1763. Catherine invited the German people to  Russia to develop the vast steppes and promised them land, freedom from military conscription and religious freedom. By about 1870 these privileges were at risk. Because of impending military conscription and loss of religious freedom, the communities of German settlers along the Volga River elected five men to act as scouts to inspect the prospects of life in America. Peter Leiker (of Obermonjou), Peter Stecklien (of Zug), Anton Wasinger (of Sch√∂nchen), Nicholas Schamme (of Graf), and Jacob Ritter (of Luzern) left from Obermonjou, Russia in 1874, landed in New York City and traveled westward as far as Nebraska. They found the prospects of life in America and the farmland of Nebraska favorable and returned to Russia with their report. Encouraged by the accounts of these men, a group of colonists left Russia in 1875 and landed in Baltimore on November 23, 1875. They traveled westward, spending the winter in Topeka, Kansas and then moved on to settle in Ellis County in the spring of 1876.

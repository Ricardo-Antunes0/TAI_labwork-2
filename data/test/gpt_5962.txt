Ulmus boissieri Grudz., , a disputed species, is a European elm that was first mentioned in 1753 by Joan Baptista Boissier. It is not known with certainty where it grows naturally, but it is most likely in the Pyrenees, the Alps, or the Carpathians.  Ulmus boissieri is a small to medium-sized elm tree, typically growing to about 15–30 m tall, with a trunk diameter of up to 2 m. The bark is reddish-brown and scaly, and the leaves are elliptical, 8–12 cm long and 3–5 mm wide, with a serrated margin. The flowers are small and white, produced in early spring before the leaves, and are pollinated by bees. The fruit is a samara, 2–3 cm long and 1 cm wide.  Ulmus boissieri is closely related to Ulmus europaea (the European elm), and may even be considered a variety of that species. However, it has been treated as a separate species since the early 19th century, because it has a different leaf shape and flowers earlier than the European elm. Some authorities continue to consider it a variety of Ulmus europaea, while others maintain that it is a distinct species.  Ulmus boissieri is hardy in most parts of Europe, but does not tolerate cold temperatures well; it is also susceptible to Dutch elm disease. It has been used for timber since antiquity, but

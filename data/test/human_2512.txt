Ana Roxanne (born 1986/1987) is an American experimental and ambient musician and singer. She is known for her blend of jazz, choral, electronic, and Hindustani sounds, and thematic exploration of self-concept and gender identity. She has released two albums: an extended play titled "~~~" (2015), and a full-length album, Because of a Flower (2020). Early life and education  Ana Roxanne was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. She is of Filipino descent, and was raised Catholic in a predominantly Filipino community in Vallejo. She was homeschooled until later attending a Catholic high school. Her parents both listened to music often; her father would listen to classical music and oldies, and her mother would listen to rhythm and blues. Roxanne developed singing ambitions after watching Alicia Keys perform "Fallin'" on MTV. She initially thought she wanted to be a jazz singer. In 2005, she moved to rural Iowa to study in a jazz and classical music program at a community college. While at school, she performed choral music across cathedrals in the Midwest. She eventually dropped out of the program, but finished college and moved to Minneapolis, where she played in a "spazzy prog/math rock" band for three years.

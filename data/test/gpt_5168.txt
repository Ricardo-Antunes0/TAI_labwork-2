Georg Schrimpf (13 February 1889 â€“ 19 October 1979) was a German psychiatrist who is considered one of the founders of modern psychoanalysis.  Born in Munich, Schrimpf studied medicine at the University of Munich and then worked as a hospital doctor. In 1923, he began his psychiatric training at the University of Zurich and then at the University of Freiburg. He became a professor at the University of Freiburg in 1932 and remained there until his retirement in 1968.  Schrimpf's seminal work was "The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis" (1936), which introduced the term "psychoanalysis" to the English-speaking world. His other important works include "The Theory and Practice of Psychoanalysis" (1937), "Personality Structure and Pathology" (1950), and "The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child" (1952).

Hripsime (, died c. 290), also called Hripsela or Hripsela√Ødes, was an ancient Greek lyric poet.  Hripsime was born in the city of Miletus in Ionia, probably in the mid-5th century BC. She is known only from a few fragments of her poetry, but her work is highly esteemed by ancient critics. She is considered one of the earliest representatives of the Alexandrian school of poetry, and her poetry is characterised by its refined and sensitive language.  Hripsime was a friend and contemporary of Sappho, and the two poets often collaborated on poems. She died around 290 BC.

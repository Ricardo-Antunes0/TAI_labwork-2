Playing southern rock, post grunge and hard rock, and influenced by many bands such as The Allman Brothers, Matchbox 20, Led Zeppelin and Dave Matthews Band, the group has released an EP, and album, and three singles since 2011. Early life  The band was founded by Elie Zeidan (guitar, vocals) and Samuel George (keyboard) back in 2005, during high school years where they have called the band "Rebellious Phoenix", when they decided to play some sophisticated tunes inspired by the 70's southern rock and hard rock era, alongside with 80's rock music and 90's post grunge. Roy (guitar), Sam's brother,  joined the band just as they were composing their first original. After playing at high school events and concerts, the band moved on to perform in different events across Lebanon. In 2011 the band recorded demos of their originals (home studio) under the name of "The FreeRolls" just as Martin Nassif (bass) joined the band. The demo projects made the band shift their focus towards recording, changing their cover band image into a more independent one.

Mir Ali Ahmed Khan Talpur (died April 1987) was a Pakistani politician who served as the 15th defence minister of Pakistan from 1978 to 1985 in the government of general Zia-ul-Haq. Prior to his appointment as defence minister, he served as agriculture and food minister in East Pakistan from 1955 to 56. Biography  He was born in Hyderabad, Sindh, India. He started his political career when he joined Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind in 1936. Later in 1939, he joined Khaksar movement when Inayatullah Khan Mashriqi invited him. When Mashriqui was imprisoned in 1941, Talpur was elected as the acting head of the movement for the 22 months. However, in 1944 he disassociated himself from the movement after Allama wrote a letter to him concerning his role in forming Fidayeen-e-Ameer (Islamic military organisation) in Sindh against the movement, and he subsequently joined the Indian National Congress to participate in the Indian independence movement. He allegedly opposed the partition of India. When Pakistan was formed as a sovereign state in 1947, he was imprisoned for six months under court-martial law.

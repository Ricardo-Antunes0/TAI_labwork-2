Yuan Xun (元恂) (483–497), né Tuoba Xun (拓拔恂, changed 496), courtesy name originally Yuandao (元道), then Xuandao (宣道, changed 496), was a crown prince of the Xianbei-led Northern Wei dynasty of China. Tuoba Xun was born in 483, as Emperor Xiaowen's oldest son.  His mother was Consort Lin.  At the time he was born, Emperor Xiaowen's step-grandmother Grand Empress Dowager Feng was the regent, and she opined that, pursuant to Northern Wei's tradition that a crown prince's mother should be forced to commit suicide, Consort Lin, because Tuoba Xun would presumably eventually become crown prince, should be forced to commit suicide.  Even though Emperor Xiaowen did not want to follow that tradition, he did not want to disobey Grand Empress Dowager Feng, and Consort Lin was forced to commit suicide.  He did, however, posthumously honor her as Empress Zhen, and buried her at the ancestral tomb of the emperors.

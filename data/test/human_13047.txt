Centennial Neighborhood District is a national historic district located at Lafayette, Tippecanoe County, Indiana.  The area originated as the Bartholomew and Davis Additions to Lafayette in 1829.  Growth came rapidly after the Wabash and Erie Canal arrived in 1843.  Growth continued with the arrival of the railroad in 1853.  The Centennial Neighborhood Historic District takes its name from the Centennial School, which was constructed in 1876 on the centennial of the nation.  The school was located on the north east corner of Brown Street at North 6th Street.  The school has been removed and a park created at its original location. History The area began to grow in the 1830s as the boundaries of Lafayette expanded north and east of the Wabash River.  It was the introduction of the Wabash Canal in 1843 that lead to rapid growth. The Canal followed the route of Canal Road and the current tracks on the west side of the neighborhood.  The area began to develop mills, warehouses and wharves serving the canal.  The Reverend Samuel Johnson built a house in 1844 on the north east corner of Ferry and Sixth Streets, which is the oldest structure in the district.  The following year, 1844, Richard DeHart House was constructed at 602 N. Fifth Street (northeast corner of Cincinnati and Fifth Streets).  The canal growth came to a close with the arrival of the railroads in 1853.  Five houses represent the canal era, located 716 and 729 Brown Street, 636 Ferry Street, 713-715 North Fourth Street.

A tethered flight test is a type of flight testing where a machine is connected by a tether to the ground. Tethered testing may be used when motion through the atmosphere is not required to sustain flight, such as for airship; vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), rotary wing or tiltwing aircraft (tethered hovering); or for tests of certain rockets, such as vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL). Fixed wing scale models can be tested on a tether in a wind tunnel, simulating motion through the atmosphere. History Numerous vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft conducted their initial flights while tethered. Early vertical flights of the Short SC.1, an early experimental aircraft that was the first British fixed-wing VTOL aircraft as well as the first one to transition between vertical and horizontal flight modes. For these flights, a custom-built gantry was developed that accommodated only a limited amount of freedom, up to 15 ft vertically and 10 ft off-centre in any direction, vertical velocity was also restricted to less than 10 ft/second; progressive arresting of the aircraft occurred beyond these limitation. It would take off from a grid platform positioned 6 ft above the ground itself in order to circumvent the ground effect phenomenon; considerable effort on the part of Shorts had been made during development of a suitable platform to eliminate the negative impact of ground effect and was redesigned several times. The gantry facility was used for ab initio training and familiarisation purposes for the first 8 pilots to fly the SC.1.

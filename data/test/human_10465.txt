The Life Chain is an anti-abortion social movement organization, one of the largest in the United States and Canada. It was started in 1987 in Yuba City and Marysville by a small California-based Pro-Life ministry called Please Let Me Live. Every first Sunday of October, Life Chain invites various churches and congregations across the United States and Canada to stand on designated sidewalks to pray and rally for one hour. Backlash In September 1991, Life Chain activists formed a demonstration in Manhattan, New York City during which 1,200 Pro-Life advocates formed a "vast, sparse human cross." This relatively small number of "Pro-Lifers" was met with an opposing Pro-Choice demonstration, consisting of 4,000 pro-abortion marchers who rallied down the streets and "engulfed them in a roar of chants, shouts, and anger." No injuries were reported and only three people were taken in to custody for disorderly conduct. After the streets settled down, both sides were quick to claim victory; the pro-abortion group, led by Rayna Baum, saw success in its superior numbers, while the Pro-Life group saw success in their being faithful in their service to God in the face of overwhelming opposition.

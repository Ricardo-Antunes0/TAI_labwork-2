The Royal Border Bridge spans the River Clyde between the towns of Dumbarton and Renfrew in Scotland. The bridge is part of the A77 road and is operated by Scottish Borders Council.  The Royal Border Bridge is a toll bridge that opened to traffic on 25 July 1881. It was designed by Sir John Fowler and built by the Dumbarton Bridge Company. The bridge cost Â£239,000 to build, which was raised through a public subscription. It was named after the Royal Border Line railway which crossed the River Clyde at this point.  The bridge became one of the most important crossings between Scotland and England and was used by both military and civilian traffic. During World War II, the bridge was damaged by bombs and had to be repaired. Since then, it has been maintained by Scottish Borders Council. The Royal Border Bridge is one of Scotland's oldest bridges and is also the largest single-span suspension bridge in Britain.

The Roman d'Alexandre, from  the Old French romandre, is a medieval romance poem written in Occitan by the troubadour Bernart de Ventadorn around 1290. It tells the story of a young man named Alexandre, who falls in love with a princess named Clorinde.  The poem is notable for its dense, elaborate rhyming scheme and its flowing, lyrical language. It has been compared to the Arthurian legend of Lancelot and Guinevere, and has been praised for its poetic beauty.

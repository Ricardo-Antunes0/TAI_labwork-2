The Pocket Testament League is a Christian nonprofit organization with members from various denominational backgrounds which distributes printed copies of the Gospels of the Biblical 'New Testament'. A small team runs the ministry and it is managed by a 15-person board of trustees. Members of The Pocket Testament League have shared over 110 million gospels globally. History  The Pocket Testament League was founded in 1893 by a teenage girl named Helen Cadbury, as a means of converting her classmates. In 1904, Helen married American evangelist Charles McCallon Alexander, who officially organized the league with Dr. J. Wilbur Chapman at Philadelphia in March 1908. Alexander had been associated with the prominent evangelist Dwight L. Moody, and his experience in worldwide evangelism gave huge impetus to the League. In 1914, The Pocket Testament League opened an office in London and began sharing gospels as part of its First World War outreach. In October, one of their campaigns gave out 400,000 New Testaments to soldiers on Salisbury Plain.

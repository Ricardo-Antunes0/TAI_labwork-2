The British folk revival incorporates a number of different strands of folk music, including traditional English ballads, Irish folk songs, and Appalachian music. The revival began in the early 1960s and gained momentum in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with performers such as Bert Jansch, John Renbourn, and Davy Graham playing a major role. The revival has had a significant impact on modern folk music, with many contemporary performers drawing on its traditions.

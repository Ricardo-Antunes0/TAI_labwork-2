Helen Orr "Elenor" Gordon (later McKay; 10 May 1933 â€“ 5 July 2014) was a Scottish breaststroke swimmer who represented Great Britain at the 1948, 1952 and 1956 Olympics, and Scotland at the 1950 and 1954 British Empire Games. She won an Olympic bronze medal in the 200-metre breaststroke in 1952 and three gold medals at the British Empire Games. Early life Gordon was born in Glasgow, Scotland.  Gordon's mother, father and three daughters lived in a room and kitchen with an outside toilet opposite Hamilton police station. Her mother worked by taking in washing from the police station. She learnt to swim at Hamilton Baths, where her father Gavin Gordon worked as a lifeguard. She was also part of the swimming team coached by David Crabb at the Motherwell Baths. Her training had been restricted to 20-minute sessions at Hamilton where 90% of pool time was reserved for males. She had to compete for space with children learning to swim. Gordon remembered rationing in post-war Britain as a teenager. One of her memories was "queuing for hours in Hamilton after the war, and you were restricted to four apples when you got to the head of the queue." When she traveled for her competitions the family had to hand in their rationing books so that they were not given a surplus of food.

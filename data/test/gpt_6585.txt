The Duchy of Nassau (German: Herzogtum Nassau) was a state of the Holy Roman Empire, established in 1692. It was a constituent principality of the House of Habsburg, which ruled Austria, Hungary and Bohemia. The duchy was named after the House of Nassau, a German dynasty which originated in the Duchy of Brabant.  The duchy was divided into three parts in 1806 and it was annexed by Prussia in 1866. In 1918, following World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it became part of the newly created Weimar Republic. In 1933, it became part of Nazi Germany and in 1945 was taken over by the Allies as part of the post-World War II reconstruction process.

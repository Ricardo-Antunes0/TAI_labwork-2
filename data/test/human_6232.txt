One  super-power, Japan, had been waiting for a long time, expecting an opportunity to realise its plan of creating a 'Greater Asia'. Japan’s  plan was to extend its empire to include Singapore, Malaya, Thailand and Burma up to India. On 15 Feb 1942, Singapore fell at the hands of Japan, which had begun the war in the name of Asian independence. Immediately, Japan decided to carry out its plans of creating a Greater Asia, basically an area under Japanese control. As a first step, Japan planned to lay the Siam – Burma railway line connecting Siam(i.e., Thailand) and Myanmar.

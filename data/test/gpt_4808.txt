Baron Morley is an abeyant title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 14 December 1892 for the Liberal statesman Charles Morley. The title is held by his grandson, the fourth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2006.  The Morleys were an old Anglo-Norman family that settled in Yorkshire in the 12th century. The first member of the family to become a Baronet was Sir John Morley, who was created a Baronet in 1628. The family's fortunes rose in the 19th century with Charles Morley, who served as Foreign Secretary under William Ewart Gladstone and as Home Secretary under Henry Campbell-Bannerman. He was also Treasurer of the Navy and Leader of the Liberal Party. On his death in 1892, he was succeeded by his son, the second Baronet. He served as Chief Secretary for Ireland from 1890 to 1892 and as President of the Board of Trade from 1895 to 1905. His son, the third Baronet, also served as Chief Secretary for Ireland and as a Privy Counsellor. He was killed in an air crash in 1916.   The fourth Baronet is a Conservative politician and former Minister of State at the Department for Education and Skills.

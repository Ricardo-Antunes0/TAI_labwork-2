An asymmetric carbon atom (chiral carbon) is a carbon atom with a configuration of the carbon atom that is not the normal tetrahedral configuration. These atoms are found in nature as a result of the optical isomerism of carbon-12.  Asymmetric carbon has a number of properties that make it interesting, including its ability to form complex molecules. For example, it is common for asymmetric carbons to be found in molecules that have chiral centers, which are sites where the chemical structure of the molecule is determined by the orientation of the chiral carbon atom.

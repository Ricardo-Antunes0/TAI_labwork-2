The Empire Hotel (also known as the Empire Tavern) is a historic building at 396 Princes Street, Dunedin, New Zealand, located some 700Â metres southwest of the city centre. Currently empty, it served as a public house from the 1850s until the 1990s. It has a New Zealand Historic Places Trust category 1 listing. History The Empire Hotel has long played a major role in Dunedin culture. Originally established by J.W. Feger and named The Queen's Arms, it was built on its present site in 1858, only 10 years after the founding of Dunedin. At that time, before much of the harbourside land was reclaimed, its site near the city's main wharf made it a central gathering place providing accommodation, food, and drink. When the Otago Gold Rush broke, three years later, it became the central building in a thriving entertainment district. The current brick building, designed by Thomas Bedford Cameron, replaced the original structure in 1879. The name was changed to the Union Hotel in 1890, and then to the Empire Hotel in 1898.

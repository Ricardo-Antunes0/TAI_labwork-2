 Nymphea was built in 1921 to carry passengers and freight on the Great Western Railway. The vessel was requisitioned by the Royal Navy in 1940, and served as a troopship during the Second World War. In 1946, Nymphea was sold to British Railways who renamed her Britannia. She was withdrawn from service in 1965 and sold for scrap the following year.  Nymphea was a pioneering vessel, being the first ship to be designed specifically for carrying passengers and freight on the Great Western Railway. She was also one of the first vessels to be requisitioned by the Royal Navy during World War II, serving as a troopship during the conflict. After serving British Railways for over forty years, Nymphea was withdrawn from service in 1965 and sold for scrap the following year. Her legacy remains alive through her historical significance and contribution to maritime transport.

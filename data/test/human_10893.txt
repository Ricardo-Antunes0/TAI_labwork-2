Louis-Gaston de Sonis (25 August 1825 – 15 August 1887) was a French Army officer who particularly distinguished himself in the Battle of Loigny during the Franco-Prussian War, where he lost a leg. Life Louis Gaston was born August 25, 1825 in Pointe-à-Pitre (Guadeloupe), and came to France in 1832, where he studied for the military, following in his father's footsteps.  At age 10, he lost his mother, and at age 19, his father. This double wound marked the beginning of his conversion.  In 1848, as a young officer—the only practicing Catholic in his class—he discerned a call to become a monk of Solemes, but realized that it was in the world that he was called to serve God.  At age 23, he married Anaïs, a girl of 17 years, with whom he began a family that would grow to include 12 children.  He was a loving husband and father, showed great love for the Eucharist, and shone especially in the virtue of obedience.  To grow closer to God, he joined the Third (Secular) Order of Discalced Carmelites.

Nike-X was an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system designed by Nike and developed by the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in the early 1980s. The Nike-X was an early example of a system designed to destroy incoming ballistic missiles in their terminal phase.  Nike-X was first proposed in the early 1980s as a means to counter potential Soviet ABM systems. The system was envisioned as a mobile, short-range missile defense system that could be deployed quickly to protect key national assets.   Nike-X was ultimately cancelled in the late 1980s due to budgetary constraints and technological limitations. However, the Nike-X concept served as the foundation for later missile defense systems, such as the Patriot and Aegis platforms.

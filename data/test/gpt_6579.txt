Preiser disease, or (idiopathic) avascular necrosis of the femoral head, is a rare condition in which the femoral head (the ball of bone at the top of the thigh) gradually falls off. It is most common in middle-aged and older women, and can be fatal if not treated quickly.  Preiser disease is caused by a lack of blood flow to the femoral head, which can result from any number of factors, including injury, surgery, or a genetic disposition. The condition can be diagnosed through an MRI or CT scan. Treatment typically includes surgery to remove the affected femoral head and replacement with a prosthetic one.  Preiser disease is relatively rare, affecting only about 1 in 10,000 women over the age of 50. Although it is usually fatal if not treated quickly, there are occasional cases where the condition is successfully treated with surgery.

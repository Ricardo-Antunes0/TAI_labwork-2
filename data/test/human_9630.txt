Fjotolf Hansen (born 13 February 1979), better known by his birth name Anders Behring Breivik  and by his pseudonym Andrew Berwick, is a Norwegian far-right domestic terrorist who committed the 2011 Norway attacks on 22 July 2011. On that day, he killed eight people by detonating a van bomb at Regjeringskvartalet in Oslo, then killed 69 participants of a Workers' Youth League (AUF) summer camp in a mass shooting on the island of Utøya. Breivik's trial was held in 2012. In July 2012, he was convicted of mass murder, causing a fatal explosion, and terrorism. He was found sane and guilty of murdering 77 people. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison, in a form of preventive detention that required a minimum of 10 years incarceration and the possibility of one or more extensions for as long as he is deemed a danger to society. This is the maximum penalty in Norway. Breivik announced that he did not recognize the legitimacy of the court and therefore did not accept its decision—he decided not to appeal, saying this would legitimize the authority of the Oslo District Court.

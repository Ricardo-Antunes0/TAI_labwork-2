Al Furjan is an upscale neighbourhood, gated community and resort in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The development is located in the northeast of the city, on a peninsula connected to the mainland by a bridge. The community consists of a mix of villas, apartments, and hotels.  Al Furjan was conceived in 2006 by Fadi Chehab and his wife, Mona Al-Mubarak. The project was designed by HOK, with landscape architecture by Terence Disdale Associates. The community took four years to complete and cost US$2 billion. It features a golf course, a marina, a private beach, and a luxury shopping mall.   The community has been criticized for its high prices and its exclusionary policies.

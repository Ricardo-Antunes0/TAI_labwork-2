Village Kid  (4 December 1980 â€“ 24 April 2012) was an Australian champion standardbred race horse bred in New Zealand. He was twice awarded the title of Australian Harness Horse of the Year and was known as "Willie". Early life Village Kid was purchased by Gordon Cox of Western Australia for approximately $36,000 after having won 3 of 9 races in New Zealand. He began racing as a three-year-old in New Zealand but aged four he won 17 of 27 races including the Western Australian Pacing Cup where he beat the favourite Preux Chevalier. Racing in the 1985 Inter Dominion at Moonee Valley he finished 2nd on the first night, won in slow time on night two and then was beaten by Preux Chevalier on the third night of heats. In the Inter Dominion final he led early before handing the lead to Preux Chevalier after a lap and finished second after not gaining a clear run until near the finish.

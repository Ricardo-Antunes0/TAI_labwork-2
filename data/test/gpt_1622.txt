Fort Casco was an English fort built in 1679 on the coast of Maine, in what is now Hancock County. The fort served as a defensive point for the English settlement of Casco Bay and its surrounding area during the early part of the French and Indian War.   The fort was captured by the French on October 7, 1690, and remained in French hands until March of the following year, when it was retaken by a combined force of English and Native Americans. The fort was then abandoned, and eventually disappeared from historical records.  Fort Casco is now a protected archaeological site located at Fort Casco National Historical Park.

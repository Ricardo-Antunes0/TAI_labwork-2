In algebraic geometry, a variety over a field is called a ruled variety if there exists a continuous curve on which each point is assigned a unique sequence of rational numbers in the range [0, 1] such that the sum of the rational numbers at any two points is nonzero. The curve that determines this sequence is called the ruler. Ruled varieties play a central role in the theories of algebraic curves and modular forms.

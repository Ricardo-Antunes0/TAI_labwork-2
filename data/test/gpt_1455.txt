Singapore Unbound is a New York City-based non-profit organization that promotes Singapore's internationalization and global engagement. The organization was founded in 2013 by Dr. Tony Tan, a long-time advocate of Singapore's internationalization and a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), and Mr. Sameer Samat, a corporate lawyer who specializes in M&A and investment law.   Since its establishment, Singapore Unbound has worked to promote Singapore's interests in a number of key areas, including trade, investment, education, culture, and the environment. The organization has also worked to build ties between Singapore and key global players, including the United States, China, Japan, and India.   In 2015, Singapore Unbound was awarded the inaugural Ramon Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership for its work promoting internationalization and global engagement in Singapore.

Peruvians  are the citizens of Peru. Peru is a country in South America, bordered by Ecuador to the north, Chile to the east, Bolivia and Brazil to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It is the largest country in South America and has a population of more than 30 million people. The capital of Peru is Lima.  The Andes mountain range runs through Peru. The highest peak is Mount Machu Picchu, at 14,000 feet (4,300 meters). The Amazon rainforest covers much of Peru. The Peruvian coast is a popular tourist destination, with beaches and islands such as Huanchaco and Mactan. Peru is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world.  Peruvians are descended from several groups of ancient Americans. The Inca Empire was the largest and most powerful empire in pre-Columbian America. After being defeated by the Spanish in 1532, the Inca retreated up the Andes and founded the city of Cuzco. Peruvian Arabs and Jews are descendants of immigrants from Muslim Spain and Sephardic Portugal who arrived during the 16th century. The majority of Peruvians are mestizo (of mixed Amerindian and European ancestry).

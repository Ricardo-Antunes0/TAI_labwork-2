MOVE, originally the Christian Movement for Life, is an African American militant religious organization which originated in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The group's stated mission is to "transform the community by creating a spirit of self-determination and empowerment through education and social action."  MOVE has been involved in a number of high-profile incidents, including the 1985 bombing of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the 1993 bombing of a Jewish community center in Philadelphia. The FBI has alleged that MOVE was responsible for both bombings, although no convictions have been obtained. In 2003, a federal grand jury declined to indict any individuals for either bombing.

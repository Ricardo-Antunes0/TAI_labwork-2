9 Puppis is a binary star system in the southern constellation of Puppis. It was originally designated 9 Argus, being part of the now defunct Argo Navis constellation. The system is faintly visible to the naked eye as a point of light with a combined apparent visual magnitude of 5.16. The magnitude difference between the two stars is 0.65. Parallax measurements yield a distance estimate to 9 Puppis of approximately 54 light years from the Sun, with the dynamic and trigonometric parallaxes for the system being in close agreement. It is drifting closer with a systemic radial velocity of –21 km/s. The motion of the system through space is predicted to bring it as close as  in about 292,000 years. The binary nature of this system was discovered by S. W. Burnham in 1873, and it now has the discovery code BU 101 (originally: β 101). Early efforts at computing orbital elements were made by Burnham (1894), Aitken (1914), and others. The latest refined elements show an orbital period of 22.7 years with a large eccentricity (ovalness) of 0.74. The orbital plane is highly inclined to the line of sight at an angle of 80.4°.

Architecture (Latin architectura, from the Greek ἀρχιτέκτων, arkhitekton, "builder") is the design and construction of buildings and other physical structures. The term covers a wide range of activities, from planning and drawing up the basic plans, to the final execution of a structure. In addition to residential and commercial buildings, architecture includes industrial plants, public works, transportation structures, and monuments.  Architecture is one of the oldest professions. The first known professional architect was Imhotep. The history of architecture can be traced back to ancient Mesopotamia, where the first structures were built from mud-brick and stone. The Greeks adopted classical architecture, which became the basis for western architecture. In the Middle Ages, the Gothic style emerged, which used pointed arches and ribbed vaults. Renaissance architecture introduced new techniques such as flying buttresses and high ceilings. Modern architecture began in the early 20th century with the Bauhaus school of design.

The Concert of Europe refers to a series of international music festivals held in various European cities between 1873 and 1914. The concerts were conceived by a group of distinguished musicians who wanted to promote European musical cooperation.  The first Concert of Europe took place in Vienna on 25 May 1873. The aim of the event was to promote European musical harmony and understanding, and to provide a forum for the performance of new works. Over the years, the Concert of Europe became one of the most important festivals for classical music in the world.  The Concert of Europe was not only a platform for the performance of new works. It also served as a forum for the discussion of musical issues and as a meeting place for leading musicians from throughout Europe. In addition, the concerts were an opportunity for European orchestras to perform together under the guidance of famous conductors.  The Concert of Europe was discontinued after World War I due to the outbreak of World War II. However, it was revived in 1958 and has been held every two years since then. Today, the Concert of Europe is one of the most important events in the classical music calendar.

The Lost Trillion Case, also known as the Lost Billions Case, is a financial scandal in West Germany that occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, numerous West German banks were duped into investing billions of Deutsche Marks in fraudulent schemes run by Russian and East German businessmen. As a result of the fraud, West German banks lost a total of approximately $20 billion (â‚¬16.5 billion), or roughly 1% of Germany's GDP at the time.  The scandal first came to light in 1991, when reports surfaced of large transfers of money out of East Germany that could not be explained by normal economic activity. In 1992, the German government began an investigation into the financial collapse, which led to the identification of several key players in the scandal: Klaus Zumwinkel, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Vladimir Putin, and Ehud Barak.  The case remained unresolved for several years, until it was finally resolved in 1996 with the convictions of Zumwinkel, Genscher, Putin, and Barak. All five men were sentenced to lengthy prison terms; Putin received a life sentence. Although the scandal has been largely forgotten in Germany today, it remains a controversial topic there, as it has been linked to allegations of corruption and political collusion.

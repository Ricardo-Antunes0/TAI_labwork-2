Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) is Honda's term for a system that allows the engine management computer (EMC) to vary the amount of air and fuel supplied to each cylinder in response to engine load. This allows the EMC to make smoother power delivery by "throttling" or "pumping" more fuel into high-load cylinders and less into low-load cylinders. The VCM system varies the air/fuel ratio in each cylinder according to load, timing, and other factors, to provide enhanced fuel economy and performance.

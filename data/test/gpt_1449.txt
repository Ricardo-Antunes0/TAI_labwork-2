Donald Edgar Tewes (August 4, 1916 â€“ February 23, 1970) was an American sociologist and civil rights activist.  Tewes was born in 1916 in Charleston, South Carolina, to a family of modest means. After completing his undergraduate studies at the University of South Carolina, he received his PhD from Indiana University in 1945.  Tewes began his academic career as a sociology professor at the University of South Carolina, where he also served as president of the American Sociological Association (ASA) in 1966. He then moved to the University of Michigan, where he became a professor emeritus and served as director of the Institute for Social Research.  Tewes is best known for his work on race relations in America, which focused on issues such as segregation, discrimination, and civil rights. He was also a vocal critic of social engineering and government intervention in social affairs, which he saw as counterproductive and often oppressive.  Tewes died in 1970 at the age of 56 after a long struggle with cancer. He remains one of the most influential sociologists of the twentieth century.

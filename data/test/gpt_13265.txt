YWAM Koha is a New Zealand-registered Medical Aid Program that provides assistance and care to people who are homeless or in need of support.   The Koha program was founded in 1983 by a group of volunteers who recognised the need for a coordinated response to homelessness in the Auckland region. Koha now operates throughout the North Island, providing support and accommodation to people who are homeless or in need of assistance.   The Koha program offers a range of services including crisis support, housing, counselling and case management, as well as employment and training opportunities. The program operates a number of shelters across the Auckland region, including the Koha Centre in Ponsonby and the Koha House in Henderson.

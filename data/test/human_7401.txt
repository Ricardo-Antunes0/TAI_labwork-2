Black Jackson  are an alternative rock band from Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, England, formed in 2000. The band consists of Alexander Kowalczuk (lead vocals), Rob Ormerod (guitar), Pete Heywood (guitar, keyboards), Johnny Pilling (bass) and Michael Irving (drums). The band were originally a four-piece: keyboard player and rhythm guitarist Pete Heywood joined the band after working with them on a side project with Andy Chester's My Computer. The band are working on their first full studio length album, after having released demos and samplers. The title of the album remains to be confirmed and the band have given away no clues as to its content. The band's "Howl" Demo (Released Aug 2006) won critical acclaim for the single "Don't Revolve", from Paul Lester of The Guardian, who proclaimed it to be "jaunty in the same weird, haunting, dark-folky way that early James were before they became a clapalong stadium attraction â€“ a classic example of mystique-blowing", one of the band's previous releases the "End of Evermore" E.P (Released Feb 2005), gained Lester's attention for its flagship single, "The Boy Became A Voodoo Doll". a single that Lester claims "starts off gently and, at its most severe, sounds a bit like John Lydon circa PiL's Metal Box shrieking in tongues about Prozac and torture and bruises". This single has proved to be a success for the band, after being the Times Online's hottest download for 26 April 2009, billed as "Sepulchral, twisted northern soul from the Manchester newcomers"

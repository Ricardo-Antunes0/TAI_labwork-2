José Antonio Price (1890–1951) was a prominent Afro-Panamanian physician and Liberal politician who graduated from University of West Tennessee College of Medicine and Surgery in 1913. Dr. Price is regarded as the first black Panamanian to hold a medical degree in early republican Panama. Early life José Antonio Price was born in Santa Ana, Panama City, former Republic of Colombia in 1890 and was the only son of Hilda Price, an immigrant from British Honduras.  He moved very early on his life to the western part of the Isthmus, to the Caribbean location of Bocas del Toro where he spent the majority of his life and career. At the beginning of the 20th century, Bocas del Toro was a prominent international port, home to the first international headquarter of the United Fruit Company. The  Banana Industry prompted a massive wave of Afro-Caribbean immigration from places such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Martinique. Due to its vibrant economy, Bocas del Toro also welcomed Germans, French, American, British and Chinese merchants, giving birth to a multicultural society.

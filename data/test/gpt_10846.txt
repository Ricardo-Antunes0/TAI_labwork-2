In natural language processing, semantic role labeling (SRL) is the process of assigning a role to each word in a sentence or text. The goal of SRL is to identify the meaning of a sentence or text, and to analyze the relationships between the words.  SRL is a widely used technique in natural language processing, and has been used in a variety of applications, such as machine translation, grammar checking, text understanding, and information retrieval.  There are several methods for assigning semantic roles to words in a sentence or text. One common method is called the functional role labeling algorithm, which assigns each word a role based on its function in the sentence or text. Another method is called the lexical role labeling algorithm, which assigns each word a role based on its meaning in the sentence or text.

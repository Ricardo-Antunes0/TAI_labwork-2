Erik Raeburn (born June 19, 1971) is an American artist who works in a variety of media, including installation, painting, video, and sculpture. He was born in Santa Monica, California and now lives and works in New York City.  Raeburn's early work was focused on the body as site of both physical and emotional experience. He has since shifted his focus to the idea of the self as an open book, exploring the possibilities of memory, identity, and self-expression. His paintings depict characters whose psyches are in flux, confronting difficult truths and emerging transformed.  Raeburn's work has been exhibited at museums including the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Tate Gallery, and the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. In 2017 he was awarded the MacArthur Fellowship.

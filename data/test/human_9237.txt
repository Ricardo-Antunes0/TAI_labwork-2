Venetian Left (, SV) is a social-democratic and green political party in Veneto, embracing pro-Europeanism, internationalism, as well as Venetian nationalism and separatism. Its first leaders were Matteo Visonà Dalla Pozza and Giovanni Masarà. Its current leaders are Antonella Muzzolon and Matteo Visonà Dalla Pozza. The party is a member of the European Free Alliance Youth (EFAY). Masarà has been one of its vice presidents until 2019 when, as part of the renewal of the bureau, he has been replaced by former Sanca co-leader Andrea Mion. History During a Venetist demonstration in Bassano del Grappa in December 2013, a group of left-leaning Venetists occasionally met and decided to start SV, which was officially founded as a full-fledged party in July 2015. Since then, the party has maintained relations with other Venetist parties, but also with some elected members of the Venetian branch of the Democratic Party such as senator Simonetta Rubinato, and regional councillor Cristina Guarda.

In United States constitutional theory, compact theory is a legal theory that holds that the Constitution of the United States is a compact among the states, and that its provisions are to be interpreted in accordance with their original public meaning. The theory has been influential in the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and other constitutional provisions.  The compact theory of the Constitution is an important part of American constitutional law. It was first articulated in the late 19th century by legal scholars such as Oliver Wendell Holmes and Roscoe Pound. It holds that the Constitution is a compact among the states, and that its provisions should be interpreted in accordance with their original public meaning. This original public meaning is supposed to be the meaning that was intended by the framers of the Constitution when they created it.  The compact theory has been influential in the interpretation of a number of constitutional provisions. For example, it has been used to interpret the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause, which prohibits state governments from denying individuals certain rights based on their race or ethnicity. The compact theory also plays a role in the interpretation of other constitutional provisions, such as the First Amendment's free speech clause.

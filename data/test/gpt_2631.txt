"On Eagle's Wings" is a devotional Hymn by Rudyard Kipling. It was written in 1895, and has been recorded by many artists.  The hymn tells the story of a young boy who is told by an eagle that he can fly. The boy follows the eagle's advice and gains new confidence in himself. He eventually becomes a great hero, and his story inspires others to follow their dreams.

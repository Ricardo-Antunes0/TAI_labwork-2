The third Cowper ministry was the seventh and final ministry of the British Prime Minister, Lord John Russell. It lasted from 4 July 1861 to 30 November 1863.  The Cowper ministry staged a number of reforms, including the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1862 and the Education Act of 1863, which provided free education for all children in Britain. The Cowper ministry also proposed the creation of a National Insurance system, but this proposal was not passed. The Cowper ministry was also unsuccessful in its attempt to secure a negotiated settlement with France over the Franco-Prussian War.

Renée-Élisabeth Marlié (1714 – 27 March 1773, also spelled Marlié) was a French painter.  Born in Paris, Marlié was the daughter of the painter Jean-Baptiste Marlié and his wife Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson. She was initially apprenticed to her father, but later studied under François Boucher and Jacques-Louis David. Her early works were characterised by their classical style, but she later developed a more naturalistic approach. She is best known for her portraits, which are often sympathetic depictions of her sitters. She also painted religious scenes, landscape paintings, and still lifes. She died in Paris.

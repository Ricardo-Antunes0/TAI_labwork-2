(Finnish: “Death”), JS 113, is incidental music composed by Jean Sibelius in 1865. Kuolema was written to commemorate the death of Sibelius’s mother, who had died the year before. The work is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani and strings.  Sibelius wrote Kuolema in a single night at his home in Jyväskylä in 1865. The work is dedicated to his mother and is scored for a small ensemble of strings and woodwinds. Kuolema is one of the few pieces in Sibelius’soeuvre written expressly for mourning. The harmonic language of Kuolema is extremely dark and its slow movement is one of the longest in classical music.

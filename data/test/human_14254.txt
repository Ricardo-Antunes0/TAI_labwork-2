The B.C. Open was a PGA Tour golf tournament in New York, held annually from 1971 to 2006. In 1971, it was called the Broome County Open, and the next year it switched to the B.C. Open. In 1973, it became a PGA Tour regular 72-hole money event.  From 2000 to 2006, it took place during the same week as The Open Championship, so the leading players were not available and it was one of the smaller events on the PGA Tour schedule. The purse for the final edition in 2006 was $3 million. The tournament was played at the En-Joie Golf Course in Endicott in Upstate New York for every event through 2005. In 2006, severe flooding of the adjacent Susquehanna River forced the event to move to the Atunyote Golf Club at the Turning Stone Resort & Casino in Verona. The event was operated by Broome County Community Charities, Inc. Since its inception, the B.C. Open has turned back to local charities in excess of $7.4 million through 2003.

Vivian Bales (married name Faison, January 1909–December 1984) was an American author, journalist and actress.  Bales was born in 1909 in Danville, Illinois, the daughter of Mildred (née Field) and John Bales. She attended Northwestern University, where she was a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority. After graduating in 1932, she moved to New York City to become a writer.  Bales first worked as a journalist, writing for "The New York Times" and "The Washington Post". In 1941, she published her first novel, "The Well of Loneliness". The book was well-received and became a bestseller. Bales followed it up with "The Keep", which was also successful.  In the 1950s and 1960s, Bales wrote a number of novels which were not as well-received as her earlier work. She retired from writing in the early 1970s. Bales died in 1984.

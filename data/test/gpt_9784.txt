It is located at the confluence of the Afon Du River and the River Tawe, about 16 miles south-west of Cardiff.  Pontardawe is a commercial town with a population of about 11,000 people. The town's economy is based on retailing, although there is also a significant agricultural sector. The Welsh language is spoken by a majority of the population. Pontardawe has two schools: Pontardawe Community School and Ysgol Gyfun Llangefni. There is also a library, a theatre, and several pubs and clubs.  The name "Pontardawe" is derived from the Welsh word "pont", meaning bridge, and "ardawe", meaning fortification or town. The first reference to Pontardawe dates from 1212, when it was mentioned as part of the manor of Llantwit Major. Pontardawe developed as a small market town owing to its location on important trade routes between Bristol and South Wales, as well as its close proximity to the fortifications at Aberdyfi. The market was abolished in 1840 but restored in 1876.  Pontardawe experiences a warm maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest Met Office weather station is at Ystrad Myn

The Rembrandt Research Project (RRP) was an academic research project that was conducted at the University of Amsterdam from 1984 to 2002. The RRP was directed by Prof. Dr. H.W.J. de Vries and focused on the study of the life and work of Rembrandt van Rijn, one of the most famous and influential painters in European history.  The RRP was a major undertaking, involving the compilation and analysis of a vast body of source material relating to Rembrandt's life and work. This material was collected from a wide range of sources, including art historians, museum staff, scholars, and private collectors. In addition to this primary research, the RRP also conducted extensive secondary research, which included the examination of historical documents, manuscripts, and prints.  The RRP was a major success, yielding a number of important publications on Rembrandt's life and work. These include The Life and Work of Rembrandt van Rijn (1986), The Paintings of Rembrandt (1996), and The Complete Paintings of Rembrandt (2002). The project also generated a considerable body of scholarly debate, which has been instrumental in furthering our understanding of Rembrandt's art.

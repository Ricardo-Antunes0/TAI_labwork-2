The phrase crossing the Rubicon is an allusion to the crossing of the River Rubicon by Julius Caesar in 49 BC, which marked the beginning of Caesar's civil war against Pompey.  The phrase has been used since at least the early 16th century, and refers to a point at which a person or thing has crossed a line or threshold that is no longer returnable. In military terms, it refers to the point at which an army has crossed the boundary into enemy territory with the intent to engage in combat.

The sixth USS Hornet was a gunboat in the United States Navy. Hornet, the former yacht Alicia, was built by Harlan and Hollingsworth, Wilmington, Delaware, in 1890; purchased from Henry Morrison Flagler on 6 April 1898; and commissioned at New York 12 April 1898, Lieutenant James Meredith Helm in command. Service history Six days after she commissioned, Hornet sailed to join the American fleet blockading Spanish Cuba. Beaching Havana 24 April, she cruised in Cuban waters with several short trips to Key West. On 30 June 1898, Hornet was sent to reconnoiter cays and shoals off the Spanish fort at Manzanillo in company with  and . Early that morning, she seized the schooner Nickerson, of English registry but loaded with provisions and under a Spanish crew, trying to make her way into the blockaded harbor. At 08:15, the American ships spotted a Spanish gunboat anchored under the blockhouses of the Army, but closed for action anyway. Although under heavy and continuous fire from shore batteries and a small arms fusillade from Spanish troops, the American ships fired on and sank the gunboat, withdrawing with no casualties. That same day the three ships entered Manzanillo harbor and were soon deep in battle, with shells splashing in the water all around. Hornets main steam pipe was cut by a Spanish shell and the ship filled with steam.

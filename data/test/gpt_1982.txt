He is known for his work on the design and analysis of algorithms, in particular for his influential textbook Algorithms and Data Structures, which has been published in five editions and has been translated into several languages.  Coia received his B.S. in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 1977, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Stanford University in 1980 and 1983, respectively. At Stanford, he was a member of the research staff of the Computer Science Department from 1980 to 1988, when he became an associate professor. He was promoted to full professor in 1994.  Coia has served on the editorial boards of the journals "Algorithmica" and "The Journal of Computer Science" and on the program committees of numerous conferences, including the Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (PPPL), the ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), the Conference on Advanced Computer Architecture (CACA), and the International Conference on Very Large Databases (VLDB). He is also a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).

A radio listening station (also: listening post, listening post station, or interception station) is a facility used to collect and process communications signals. They are typically found in strategic locations such as military bases, border crossings, and airports.  Listening stations can be used for a variety of purposes, such as intercepting enemy communications, monitoring political or religious dissidents, preventing smuggling and espionage, or tracking the movements of criminals. They are also used for traffic control, air navigation, and meteorology.  The development of wireless technology has made listening stations less necessary, but they are still in use around the world. Some listening stations are now operated by private companies rather than the government.

The Wardwell-Trickey Double House is a historic two-family residence at 97-99 Ohio Street in Bangor, Maine.  Built in 1836, it is one of the least-altered early duplex brick houses in the city, in a form that war rarely seen in the state outside Bangor.  The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The Wardwell-Tricky House is located on the north side of Ohio Street, just east of Coe Park, and a short way northwest of Bangor's central business district.  It is a -story brick structure, with a gable end facing the street to the south.  The house is divided longitudinally along its gable ridge into two units, and presents two five-bay fronts to the east and west.  A -story wood-frame addition extends to the north, continuing this division.  Each unit has two chimneys at the ends of the main block, and a third in the ell.  The entrances are set in recessed openings at the centers of the facades, and appear to be early 20th-century Colonial Revival replacements.  The interiors of both units have retained a significant amount of original woodwork and hardware, including plasterwork, Greek Revival doors, stair rails, and newel posts.

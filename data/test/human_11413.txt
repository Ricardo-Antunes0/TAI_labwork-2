Failing badly and failing well are concepts in systems security and network security (and engineering in general) describing how a system reacts to failure. The terms have been popularized by Bruce Schneier, a cryptographer and security consultant. Failing badly A system that fails badly is one that has a catastrophic result when failure occurs. A single point of failure can thus bring down the whole system. Examples include:  Databases (such as credit card databases) protected only by a password. Once this security is breached, all data can be accessed.  Fracture critical structures, such as buildings or bridges, that depend on a single column or truss, whose removal would cause a chain reaction collapse under normal loads.  Security checks which concentrate on establishing identity, not intent (thus allowing, for example, suicide attackers to pass).  Internet access provided by a single service provider.  If the provider's network fails, all Internet connectivity is lost.  Systems, including social ones, that rely on a single person, who, if absent or becomes permanently unavailable, halts the entire system.  Brittle materials, such as "over-reinforced concrete", when overloaded, fail suddenly and catastrophically with no warning.  Keeping the only copy of data in one central place. That data is lost forever when that place is damaged, such as the 1836 U.S. Patent Office fire, the American 1973 National Personnel Records Center fire, and the destruction of the Library of Alexandria.

Bob "Mr. Mac" McQuillen (June 27, 1923 – September 10, 2001) was an American jazz drummer and bandleader. He is considered one of the most influential drummers in the history of jazz, and was a driving force behind the revival of jazz in the late 1950s and 1960s.  Born in Detroit, Michigan, McQuillen began playing drums at an early age. After serving in World War II, he moved to New York City and joined Benny Goodman's big band. He soon became one of the most sought-after drummers in the music industry, working with such leading performers as Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Sarah Vaughan. He also formed his own groups and recorded extensively as a leader. McQuillen's style was characterized by its swing feel, strong groove, and use of African percussion instruments such as djembe and congas. He is often cited as being one of the most influential drummers in jazz history.  McQuillen died from cancer at the age of 80 in 2001. His influence can be heard in the music of such contemporary drummers as Chad Smith, John Bonham, Stewart Copeland, Neil Peart, Billy Cobham, and Dave Grohl.

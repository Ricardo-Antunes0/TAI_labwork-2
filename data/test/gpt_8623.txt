Wallachia or Walachia (; , ; archaic: Улсавия, Ulsava) was a province of the Ottoman Empire, located in southeastern Europe. Its territory corresponded to that of present-day Romania and Bulgaria. The region has been inhabited since the Paleolithic, and its name may derive from Wallachians, a team of ancient Illyrian horsemen.  The first written record of Wallachia is from the 6th century AD, when the Byzantine historian Procopius described its people as "Pannonians". In 1449, Wallachia came under the rule of the Ottoman Empire and remained so until 1878. During that time, it was occupied by Austrians (1866-1878), Russians (1877-1878), and Germans (1918-1919). In 1881, Romania gained independence from the Ottoman Empire and, in 1907, Wallachia became part of Romania. In 1918-1919, following World War I, it was occupied by the Central Powers and then restored to Romania.  Today, Wallachia is a rural province with a population of about 1.2 million people. Its capital is Ploieşti.

Bachaler Olaszkai (; died around 1300) was a Hungarian nobleman, bishop of Várad (1298–1302), and later of Szeged (1303–1310).  Bachaler Olaszkai was the son of a nobleman, Ladislaus IV of Hungary, and his wife, Bela II of Hungary. He was probably born around 1195. His father had been imprisoned by King Andrew II of Hungary for supporting the rebels against the king, but he was eventually released and returned to Hungary in 1201. Bachaler Olaszkai married Margaret, daughter of Nicholas III, Count of Gorizia and Strumia, in 1209.  Bachaler Olaszkai served as a knight in the army of King Andrew II during the latter's war against the rebel Thomas I of Hungary in 1206. He participated in the Battle of Mohács on 15 August 1211, where he was captured by the rebel forces. He was released in 1213 after Andrew II's victory over Thomas I.  Bachaler Olaszkai served as Bishop of Várad from 1298 to 1302. He also served as Bishop of Szeged from 1303 to 1310.

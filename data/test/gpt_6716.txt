The culture of Canada embodies the artistic, literary, musical, and social traditions of Canadians. It is a mixture of indigenous cultures and the traditions of immigrants, who have contributed to the country's rich mosaic.  The official languages of Canada are English and French. Canadian culture has been strongly influenced by its colonial past, with Britain and France being the main sources of immigrants. Canada is also a country with a strong sense of identity and is often referred to as a "nation within a nation".  Canadian culture has been heavily shaped by its geography and its history. The country is surrounded by oceans on three sides and by the United States on two others, resulting in a strong maritime tradition. Canada has also been influenced by its neighbour to the south, the United States, which has had a large impact on Canadian culture through its military presence and trade links.  Canada has a rich diversity of cultures, which can be seen in the country's cuisine, art, music, literature, and film. Canadian culture is often seen as being tolerant and welcoming towards immigrants, which has helped to make Canada one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world.

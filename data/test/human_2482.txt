Bernardino Verro (; July 3, 1866 â€“ November 3, 1915) was a Sicilian syndicalist and politician. He was involved in the Fasci Siciliani (Sicilian Leagues) a popular movement of democratic and socialist inspiration in 1891-1894, and became the first socialist mayor of Corleone in 1914. He was killed by the Mafia. Fasci Siciliani Verro was involved in the foundation of the Fascio dei lavoratori of Corleone on September 8, 1892. At the age of 26, Verro became its president. "Our Fascio has about six thousand members," he told the journalist Adolfo Rossi, in an interview for La Tribuna from Rome in the autumn of 1893. "Our women have understood the advantages of union among the poor, and now teach their children socialism." Verro's influence was not limited to Corleone. He was involved in setting up Fasci in neighbouring towns and mediated conflicts. Travelling by mule, he spread the message also in nearby towns.

Macoma tenta, the narrowed macoma clam or elongate macoma is a species of clam, a marine bivalve mollusk (bivalvia) in the family Tellinidae and genus Macoma. Macoma tenta are one of two species of macoma clams that can be found in the Chesapeake Bay on the eastern shore of the United States in Maryland and Virginia. The macoma tenta like their cousin in the Chesapeake, the Macoma balthica or Baltic macoma clam, are small marine bivalves with thin, chalky white shells. They tend to live buried in the sandy or muddy areas of shallow water in the middle and lower Chesapeake Bay. Macoma clams are among the most abundant clams in the Chesapeake Bay. Macomas first appeared about 750,000 years ago. Appearance  Chesapeake Bay Macoma clams (both balthica and tenta) have thin and fragile shells. The elongate macoma (Macoma tenta) get their name from their elongated shell with a shell proportion (width/length) that is greater than 1.5. The narrowed macoma clam’s shells tend to be more elongated than the Baltic macoma’s shells and have a smoother, pearly sheen that is slightly iridescent. The smooth shell may have several fine concentric growth lines which indicate yearly growth. Their color is white to yellowish compared to the pinkish tint of the Baltic macoma clam. They have a narrowed posterior end that is slightly twisted or curved to the left and the anterior end is long and rounded. These clams have one foot which helps to hold them in place and two siphons, tube-like structures in which water flows. Their long, thin, flexible siphons are of unequal length and fully retractable. The narrowed macoma clam only grows to a length of approximately three-quarters of an inch.

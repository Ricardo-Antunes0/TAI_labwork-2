The 1550 siege of Fukashi was one of the bloodiest sieges in Japanese history. The castle, defended by a garrison of 1,000 samurai and their families, was besieged by a force of 6,000 troops from Shimabara Domain. The siege lasted for four months and resulted in the deaths of over 1,000 civilians and samurai.

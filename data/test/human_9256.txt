The Beardstown Ladies is a group of 16 women in their 70s who formed an investment club, formally known as the Beardstown Business and Professional Women's Investment Club, in Beardstown, Illinois in 1983 in a church basement. The club got media attention after it authored a book, published in 1995, titled The Beardstown Ladies' Common-Sense Investment Guide: How We Beat the Stock Market - And How You Can Too, which claimed that the club produced annual returns of 23.4% since inception. The club authored additional books including The Beardstown Ladies' Stitch-In-Time Guide to GrowingYour Nest Egg: Step-by-Step Planning for a Comfortable Financial Future  in January 1996 and The Beardstown Ladies' Pocketbook Guide to Picking Stocks in April 1998. The ladies gained speaking tours and became minor celebrities. In March 1998, Shane Tritsch published an article in Chicago titled Bull Marketing: Debunking the myth of the Beardstown Ladies and their spectacular stock market gains. The article noted that the club included a disclaimer in its books that the published returns included fees that were charged to members.

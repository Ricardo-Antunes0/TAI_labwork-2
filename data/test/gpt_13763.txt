Chersonasus or Chersonasos , later Chersonesus or Chersonesus Minor (Greek: Χερσόνησος, Khérsonós; Latin: Chersonesus, Chersonesus Minor), was a city on the west coast of the Black Sea, located in modern-day Turkey. It was located on the north bank of the river Tanais and is now submerged under the water of the Black Sea.  The city was founded by settlers from Miletus in about 600 BC and flourished as a trade center between Anatolia, Persia and the Greek world. The city became known as Chersonesus after its founder, Khérisson. It was captured by the Romans in 43 BC, and became an important naval base and commercial center. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Chersonesus declined and was abandoned in about 476 AD. The city was briefly revived during the 6th century AD but again fell into disuse.  The site of Chersonesus has been investigated archaeologically by underwater archaeologists since 1979. In 2010, an underwater archaeological park was inaugurated at the site of Chersonesus by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Silver City Airways was an airline, based in Tucson, Arizona, that operated scheduled passenger service from Tucson International Airport to several small cities in Arizona and New Mexico. The airline was founded in 1995 and ceased operations on February 10, 2009.  Silver City Airways was founded in 1995 by a group of aviation enthusiasts who recognized the need for an airline serving isolated communities in the Southwest United States. The airline initially operated charter service to small airports in Arizona and New Mexico before expanding its route network in 1998. The airline added scheduled service to Tucson International Airport in 2000 and continued to grow its route network throughout the next several years.  Silver City Airways ceased operations on February 10, 2009 due to financial difficulties. The airline had been struggling to remain solvent since the 2007-2008 recession and had been unable to make a significant dent in its debtload. The airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on January 14, 2009 and ceased all operations two days later.

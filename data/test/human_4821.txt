In the scenario, the player characters cross a land of smoke and fire to reach the capital of the Dragon Empire in order to confront the Dragon Queen for a final battle between good and evil. In this final battle with Takhisis at her temple in Neraka, the Heroes of the Lance must drive her back to her own plane. Battlesystem statistics are provided to enable the battle.

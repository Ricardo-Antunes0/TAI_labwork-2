Elias de Barjols (fl. 1191–1230) was a bourgeois Aquitainian troubadour who established himself in Provence and retired a monk. Eleven of his lyrics survive, but none of his music. According to his vida Elias was the son of a merchant and  came from Agenais. The name of his birthplace is  in the manuscripts, but such a name can not be found in Agenais nor elsewhere: the most recent edition suggests that  is a scribal error for , ancient name of Pujols, castle placed in Agenais, about 25 km from Agen. The identification of  as Pérols-sur-Vézère, as Stronski proposed in 1906, is untenable, because this place was not a castle and was not in Agenais, but in Limousin. According to his  he was the greatest singer of his age (but such a statement is very frequent in the ') and he travelled widely from court to court as a jongleur with a fellow jongleur named Oliver. They eventually found favour with Alfonso II of Provence: a document dated to 1208 seems to confirm this. Alfonso gave them wives and land in Barjols, where Elias is witness in a document of Ramon Berenguer IV, count of Provence (Alfonso's son) in 1222.

The rating system is divided into five levels, with each level corresponding to a different set of operating rules.  A class rating is an airman's qualification for a particular type of aircraft and its corresponding operating limitations. The rating system is divided into five levels, with each level corresponding to a different set of operating rules. A pilot who holds a class rating can fly any type of aircraft in the appropriate category, provided they comply with the applicable operating limitations for their class and level. Operating limitations may be based on the type of aircraft, the weight and balance of the aircraft, or the number and type of passengers or cargo carried.  Pilots who are rated for a particular type of aircraft must first complete an appropriate training program, which will teach them how to operate within the specific operating rules for that aircraft. Once they have completed this training, they are then ready to receive their class rating from their air force or aviation organization.

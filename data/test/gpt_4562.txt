Neuromancer is an adventure video game developed by Interplay and published by Electronic Arts in 1992. It is based on the novel of the same name by William Gibson.  The player controls a hacker named Case, who has been hired by a wealthy corporate executive to penetrate the company's security system. While there, Case discovers that the executive is part of a secret society of cyberspace explorers known as the Sprawl. He also meets a beautiful woman named Molly who entices him into the dark side of cyberspace.  The game's plot and many of its abstract elements were inspired by Gibson's experiences with electronic drugs and virtual reality. The game was met with mixed reviews from critics, some of whom praised its graphics and originality, but others found its gameplay unenjoyable and its story incoherent.

The Philadelphia Athletics were a short-lived Major League Baseball franchise that existed for two seasons from  to .  Known alternatively as the Philadelphia Quakers, and sometimes informally as "Buffinton's Beauties", they played their first season in the newly created Players' League (PL) of , and were managed by Jim Fogarty and Charlie Buffinton.  After the demise of the PL following the 1890 season, the team switched to the American Association (AA) for the 1891 season, and were managed by Bill Sharsig and George Wood.  For each season, the franchise used Forepaugh Park as their home field. Before the 1890 season, the PL was founded by the first organized professional sports union, the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players, in an attempt to compete with the existing major leagues, the National League (NL) and the AA.  Their intent was to break free from the standard business practices of the two leagues that they claimed stifled players' salaries; such as the reserve clause, and the Brush Classification System, as well as their ability to sell players to another team without the consent of the player.  The Quakers were controlled by a group of investors, which included brothers G. W. and J. Earl Wagner.

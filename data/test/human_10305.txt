Theo Hobson (born 1972) is a British theologian. He was educated at St Paul's School in London; he read English literature at the University of York, then theology at the University of Cambridge, where he was a member of Hughes Hall. He focused on the strongest voices of the Protestant tradition: Martin Luther, SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard, and Karl Barth. His PhD thesis became the basis of his first book, The Rhetorical Word: Protestant Theology and the Rhetoric of Authority (2002), a study of the role of authoritative rhetoric in Protestantism. He gradually turned his attention to ecclesiology. His next book was Against Establishment: An Anglican Polemic (2003). In this book he announced that the Church of England was doomed, and that he considered himself a "post-Anglican". His third book is Anarchy, Church and Utopia: Rowan Williams on the Church (2005), a critique of the archbishop's ecclesiology and perhaps of all ecclesiology. He has written for various journals and newspapers including The Guardian, The Times, The Spectator, and The Tablet.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is an agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that has authority over the security of the traveling public in the United States. It was created as a response to the September 11 attacks under the administration of President George W. Bush, to improve airport security procedures and centralize air travel security under a single federal agency. Chiefly concerned with air travel, the TSA employs screening officers in airports, armed Federal Air Marshals on planes, mobile teams of dog handlers, and explosives specialists. Previously part of the Department of Transportation, the TSA became part of the Department of Homeland Security in March 2003. It is presently led by Administrator David Pekoske and is headquartered in Springfield, Virginia. As of the fiscal year 2020, the TSA operated on a budget of approximately $7.68 billion and employed over 47,000 Transportation Security Officers, Behaviour Detection Officers, Transportation Security Specialists, Federal Air Marshals, and other security personnel.

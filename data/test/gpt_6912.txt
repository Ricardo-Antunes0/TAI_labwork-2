OTS 44 is a free-floating planetary-mass object discovered on December 10, 2011, by the Pan-STARRS1 telescope at Hawaii's Haleakala Observatory. OTS 44 is unusual both in its size and its location; it orbits the sun further out than any other known object.  OTS 44 is composed of an unknown type of ice, and was initially thought to be a comet. However, subsequent observations using the Keck II and WISE telescopes showed that OTS 44 is in fact a planetary-mass object, a type of body that is too large to be a comet and too small to be a planet. OTS 44's mass is currently estimated to be around 1.5Â±0.2 Earth masses, making it one of the largest objects in the solar system known to be composed of ice.  OTS 44 was discovered during a routine search for near-Earth asteroids (NEA). NEA surveys are an important part of the effort to protect Earth from potential collisions with asteroids, as well as providing insight into the origins and evolution of the solar system. OTS 44 was originally flagged as a possible NEA by Pan-STARRS1's software, but further observations with Keck II and WISE showed that it was in fact an object of planetary mass.

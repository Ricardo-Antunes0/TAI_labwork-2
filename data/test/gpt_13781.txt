Interferometry examines the general interference phenomena between waves of different frequencies and shapes. It can be used to measure the size, shape, and other properties of objects by observing the interference of waves emitted from various points on the object and detecting the changes in wave amplitude as a function of distance.  Seismic interferometry is a type of physical measurement that uses the interference of waves to determine the size, shape, and other properties of objects. The technique was first developed in the early 1800s to study earthquakes, but has since been used to study all types of waves. By observing the interference of waves emitted from various points on an object, seismic interferometry can determine its size, shape, and other properties. This information can then be used to generate maps or models of the object.  Today, seismic interferometry is used extensively to study earthquakes and other physical phenomena. The technique is also being used to study the Moon, planets, stars, and galaxies. Seismic interferometry has even been used to study the inside of black holes.  Despite its widespread use, seismic interferometry is still an relatively new field. Much research remains to be done in order to improve our understanding of the technique and its potential applications.

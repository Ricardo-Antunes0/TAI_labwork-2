India Hamilton ( - April 18, 1950) was an African-American educator. A native of King and Queen County, Virginia, Hamilton was born into poverty, the daughter of former slaves. She was a graduate of Howard University. In 1913 she began her teaching career in King William County, Virginia, where she worked in a segregated two-room school. For close to twenty years she was the Jeanes Fund supervisor for the county; in this role, she aided the community in raising money for improvements to schools and new construction, including the King William Training School. She pushed for longer school terms, and developed the idea of an annual Exhibit Day at which the work of the county's African-American students could be presented. Outside of her county duties, Hamilton chaired the Better Schools Program of the Negro Organization Society of Virginia at Hampton Institute and served on the executive committee of the Virginia State Teachers Association. An advocate for collaboration between teachers and nearby colleges, she promoted a variety of improvement projects over the years. During her career she earned the title of "the children's friend". Hamilton is interred in the graveyard of the Third Union Baptist Church in King William County.

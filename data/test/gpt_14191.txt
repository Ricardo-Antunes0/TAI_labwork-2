Subterranean fiction is a subgenre of adventure fiction, typically set below the surface of the earth. It is typically associated with horror, science fiction, and fantasy genres, but has been used for romance, mystery, and adventure novels as well.  Subterranean fiction often explores the consequences of human activity on the earth's surface and below it. It has been called "the literature of mining disasters and gas seeps", and often features protagonists who enter into dangerous or mysterious situations in search of answers.

Baron Greville, of Clonyn, County Westmeath, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 15 December 1869 for the Liberal politician Fulke Greville-Nugent, Member of Parliament for Longford from 1852 to 1869. Born Fulke Southwell Greville he was the grandson of Fulke Greville, son of the Honourable Algernon Greville, second son of Fulke Greville, 5th Baron Brooke (from whom the Greville Earls of Warwick are also descended; see this title for earlier history of the Greville family). Lord Greville married Lady Rosa Emily Mary Anne Nugent (died 1883), only daughter George Nugent, 1st Marquess of Westmeath, and assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Nugent in 1866. Through this marriage The Nugent family seat of Clonyn Castle in County Westmeath came into this branch of the Greville family. Lord Greville was succeeded by his son in 1883. The second Baron was married to the writer Violet, Lady Greville. He was a Liberal politician and served as Private Secretary to Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone from 1872–73 and as a Lord of the Treasury from 1873–74. In 1883, Lord Greville resumed by Royal licence the surname of Greville only. His eldest son the Honourable Ronald Greville represented Bradford East in Parliament but predeceased his father. On the second Baron's death the title consequently passed to his only surviving son, the third Baron.

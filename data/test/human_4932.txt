Plot Diabolo revolves around teenagers in Japan being converted to followers of the "Diabolo" by a secret society, in exchange for the fulfillment of their wishes. Teens who have made a pact with the Devil begin to go crazy at age 17, often manifesting in acts of brutality and homicide, and upon turning 18 reach a point of no return to their original selves.  The phenomenon is a mystery to the adult world and media, who try to ascertain the origin of mass teen violence.  There are six great spirits (also teenagers) that serve the Devil, each of which has a hand in destroying the world.  The main characters, Ren and Rai, use their own Devil-given powers to stop them while searching for their cousin Mio, saving other teenagers from their pacts, and racing against their approaching 18th birthdays.  It describes its plot as "The age where the ensured bend to temptation and slowly fall from human to devil."

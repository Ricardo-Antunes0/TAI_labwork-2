Andrew Edward Left  (born July 9, 1970) is an activist, short seller, author and editor of the online investment newsletter Citron Research, formerly StockLemon.com. Under the name Citron Research, Left publishes reports on firms that he claims are overvalued or are engaged in fraud. Left is known for advising investors on short selling and has often appeared on various media outlets such as CNBC and Bloomberg to talk about his opinions on stocks. In 2017, Left was called 'The Bounty Hunter of Wall Street' by The New York Times. Left gained further notoriety following his announced short of GameStop, precipitating a short squeeze that has hurt him and other short sellers in the short term. Citron launched 51 investigative reports against S&P 500 companies, as well as several Chinese companies, citing allegations of pyramid schemes, ineffective products and accounting, or business frauds. In 2016, Left was banned for five years by the Hong Kong Market Misconduct Tribunal (chaired by Mr Justice Michael Hartmann) for disclosing false or misleading information in connection with the publication of a research report on Chinese property developer Evergrande Group, and so inducing transactions under the Securities and Futures Ordinance. Despite being sued by multiple companies for the reports he has released, Left claims he has never lost a case in the United States; the National Futures Association sanctioned Left and stated that he "made false and misleading statements to cheat, defraud or deceive a customer in violation of NFA compliance rules." Although Leftâ€™s report was correct, his punishment was not rescinded.

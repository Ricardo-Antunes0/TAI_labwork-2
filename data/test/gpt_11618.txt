R. Narayana Panickar (25 January 1889 – 28 December 1965) was an Indian mathematician who made significant contributions to the theory of functions, differential equations, and mathematical analysis. He also developed the Panickar–Teichmüller theorem and the Panickar integral.  Narayana Panickar was born on 25 January 1889 in the town of Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu, India. He studied at the Madras University and obtained his B.A. in 1910 and his M.A. in 1912. He then studied at Cambridge University, where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1916.

He was also a visiting professor at several other universities, including the University of Paris (1937), the University of Geneva (1939), and the University of Pittsburgh (1951).  Narayana Panickar was a member of several professional societies, including the American Mathematical Society, the Royal Irish Academy, and the London Mathematical Society. He died on 28 December 1965 in Berkeley.  Narayana Panickar is best known for his contributions to the theory of functions, differential equations, and mathematical analysis. His most notable work includes the development of the Panickar–Teichmüller theorem and the Panickar integral.

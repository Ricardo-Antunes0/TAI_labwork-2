Background In 1962, Big Island Mine and Refinery was founded by the Stauffer Chemical Company to produces soda ash from the mined trona. In 1984, mining method was changed from conventional drilling and blasting mining to continuous mining. The company was acquired by Chesebrough Pond's in 1985. The next year, the company was sold to the British Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) after Chesebrough Pond's was acquired by the Anglo-Dutch company Unilever. In 1987, already one year later, the French chemical and pharmaceutical company Rh√¥ne-Poulenc bought the ICI interests in the soda ash production section of Stauffer Chemical. The company was sold to OCI Chemical Corporation, a subsidiary of the South Korea-based OCI Company Ltd in 1996. The production capacity was increased about one million tons of soda ash when an automated unit was pot into service in 1998. Dual fuel calcination became available in 2007. Overall plant efficiency was increased by recovering soda ash from the mine dump ponds in a newly built Decahydrate plant in 2009. In 2013, the company shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol OCIR.

Eugene W. Ferris (November 18, 1842 â€“ February 26, 1907) was a United States soldier who fought with the 30th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry during the American Civil War. He received his nation's highest award for bravery during combat, the U.S. Medal of Honor, for resisting an attack by enemy cavalrymen near Berryville, Virginia on April 1, 1865. That award was conferred 32 years later on October 16, 1897. Formative years Born in Springfield, Vermont on November 18, 1841, Eugene W. Ferris was a son of New York native Robert Ferris and Fanny Ferris, a native of Vermont. He was just a child when he and his family relocated to Lowell, Massachusetts, according to historian Allan Tischler. By 1850, the Ferris household included parents Fanny and Robert (a stonemason), and their children, Helen, Fanny, Alexander and Eugene (aged 19, 18, 11, and 8, respectively). Also residing at the home were Ruth and Chester Rugg (a clerk), and Stillman Busher. After completing his education in Lowell, Eugene Ferris also went to work, having obtained a job as a bookkeeper.

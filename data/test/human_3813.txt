Takfiri (,  lit. "excommunicational") is a term denoting a Muslim which excommunicates one of his/her coreligionists, i.e. who accuses another Muslim of being an apostate. Since according to the traditional interpretations of sharia law the punishment for apostasy is the death penalty, and potentially a cause of strife and violence in the Muslim community (Ummah), an ill-founded takfir accusation was a major forbidden act (haram) in Islamic jurisprudence, with one hadith declaring that one who wrongly declare a Muslim an unbeliever is himself an apostate. Takfirism has been called a "minority ideology" which "advocates the killing of other Muslims declared to be unbelievers". The accusation itself is called takfir, derived from the word kafir (unbeliever), and is described as when "one who is a Muslim is declared impure." An apostate is a murtad. In principle, in mainstream Sunni Islam, the only group authorised to declare a Muslim a kafir (unbeliever) is the ulama, and this is only done if all the prescribed legal precautions have been taken. An ill-founded takfir accusation was a major forbidden act (haram) in Islamic jurisprudence.  Traditionally, takfir was used against self-professed Muslims who denied one or more of the basic tenets of Islam. Islamic movements and groups like the Ahmadiyya have been called kafir and been victims of takfir by many Muslims because they are accused of denying the basic tenet of the Finality of Prophethood.

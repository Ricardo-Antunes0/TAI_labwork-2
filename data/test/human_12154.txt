Tesla Giga Shanghai (, or Gigafactory 3) is a factory in Shanghai, China operated by Tesla, Inc.  The facility currently hosts the final assembly of the Tesla Model 3 and Tesla Model Y, with Model Y deliveries slated to begin in January 2021. The factory's initial production rate target is 3,000 cars a week, eventually ramping up to 250,000 electric cars per year.  The first assembled Model 3s were delivered in December 2019, just twelve months after Tesla began site grading on the Gigafactory in December 2018. The Shanghai municipal government approved the agreement to build the production facility in July 2018, and a long-term lease was signed for about  of land in October 2018. Construction began in December 2018 with the installation of secure fencing and site offices. The General Assembly Building was nearly complete by August 2019, and manufacturing line equipment was being installed for both batteries and automobiles. The plant began initial production of Tesla Model 3 cars in October 2019, with additional production facilities for motors, seats, and powertrain assemblies under construction in late 2019 with expected completion by March 2020.

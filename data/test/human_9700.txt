Blackroom was an upcoming FPS title from the independent studio Night Work Games, created by former id Software developers John Romero and Adrian Carmack. The game was planned to be crowdfunded on the Kickstarter platform, but the crowdfunding campaign was cancelled in April 2016. The game was set to launch during the winter quarter of 2018. However, as of February 2022, there have been no more updates about the game's development. Gameplay The game was set to be a first-person shooter in the same vein as classic shooters that Romero and Carmack first formulated in their early game development years. It was described as "a return to fast, violent and masterful play on the PC." The game was also to feature various multiplayer modes along with its single player campaign, including co-operative play, deathmatch, and more. The controls were described as "fast, skillful movement with rocket jumping, strafe jumping and circle strafing," similar to the controls featured in a previous id Software title, Quake.

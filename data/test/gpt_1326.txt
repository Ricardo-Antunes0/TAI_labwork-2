Yitzhak Rabin (; , ; 1 March 1922 â€“ 10 November 1995) was the sixth Prime Minister of Israel and a central figure in Israeli politics for over two decades. As Prime Minister, Rabin presided over the country during its first years as a sovereign state, and played a leading role in the Oslo Accords, which established peace between Israel and its neighbors.  Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir on 10 November 1995, just hours after signing the Oslo Accords, which he had helped bring about. Rabin's death led to widespread mourning and deep political polarization in Israel. Rabin remains both the country's most popular Prime Minister and the only one to be assassinated.

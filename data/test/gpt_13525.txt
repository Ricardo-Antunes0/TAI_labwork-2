The McLaughlin Mound, also called Cemetery Mound, is a prehistoric earthwork located in Warren County, near Lebanon, Ohio. Constructed between AD 500 and 1000, the mound is the largest earthen construction in the United States.  The mound is named for its discoverer, General John McLaughlin, who excavated it in 1836. The mound is composed of a series of concentric circles of varying size and shape, enclosing an area of . At its center is a large conical mound, which has been interpreted as a burial mound or temple. The surrounding earthworks are arranged in a circular pattern and are separated from each other by deep trenches.  The mound was first documented by the French explorer Robert de La Salle in 1669, and was likely used as a burial ground by the Miami people. It was later used by the Shawnee and other Native American tribes. The first Europeans to visit the mound were the French, who built a fort on it in 1669. The British later built a fort on top of the mound, which was abandoned in 1794. The first American settlers to live near the mound were the Welsh immigrants who settled in Warren County in 1812.  The McLaughlin Mound is open to visitors daily from sunrise to sunset.

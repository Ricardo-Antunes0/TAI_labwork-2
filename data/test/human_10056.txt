Heavy Rock Radio is an album by JÃ¸rn Lande's solo project Jorn. It consists of cover songs from artists that inspired the singer to start his career in music. Jorn has previously released albums of cover songs in 2007, with the album Unlocking the Past, and in 2010, with his tribute to Ronnie James Dio on the album Dio. This time, instead of focusing on recording more obscure rock songs from the 70s and 80s, Jorn chose to do an album with more well known songs, including big hits such as the Eagles's "Hotel California", Journey's "Don't Stop Believin'" and Queen's "Killer Queen". Some songs in the album have Jorn showing his admiration for pop artists such as Kate Bush, Frida and John Farnham, as well as recording two songs from the 2000s, namely Iron Maiden's "The Final Frontier" and Paul Stanley's "Live to Win." He also included his typical tributes to Ronnie James Dio, with Dio's "Rainbow in the Dark" and Black Sabbath's "Die Young", and a cover of Foreigner's "Rev on the Red Line."

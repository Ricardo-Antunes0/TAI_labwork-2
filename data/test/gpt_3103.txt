The pufflegs are hummingbirds from the genera Eustachius and Trochilus. The two genera were formerly considered to be one, but DNA studies have shown that they are separate.  The pufflegs are a genus of hummingbirds which contains two species: the Eustachius puffleg and the Trochilus thoracicus. These birds are found in Central America, South America, and parts of the Caribbean. The Eustachius puffleg is found in Panama and Colombia, while the Trochilus thoracicus is found in Venezuela, Brazil, and Paraguay.   The pufflegs are small birds which have a wide range in size. The Eustachius puffleg is the smaller of the two species, with a length of about 17 cm (6.7 in), and a weight of about 80 g (2.8 oz). The Trochilus thoracicus is slightly larger, with a length of about 20 cm (8.3 in) and a weight of about 100 g (3.5 oz).   The pufflegs are mostly green, with a black head and neck, and a white throat. The wings are blackish-brown, with a green band across the middle of the wing. The tail is black, with a white tip. The males have a blue head and neck, while the females have a brown head and neck.   The pufflegs feed on insects such as beetles, flies, and mosquitoes. They

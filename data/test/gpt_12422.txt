The Dix Family Stable is an unusual stable, located in the small town of Dix, in the state of New York. It is home to a collection of horses, ponies, and donkeys, all of which are unique in their own way. The stable was founded in 1892 by John Dix, who was a blacksmith by trade. He began to collect horses, and over the years the collection has grown to include many rare and unusual animals. Today, the stable is operated by John's grandson, Jeff Dix.  The Dix Family Stable is a unique place because it is home to a collection of horses, ponies, and donkeys which are all unique in their own way. Some of the horses are old and retired from riding or breeding, while others are still active and used for riding or farming. The stable also has a number of donkeys which are used for transportation or for work on the farm.  The Dix Family Stable is open to the public four days per week: Tuesday through Saturday. It is also open for special events such as weddings or barn dances. The admission fee is $5 per person, which includes access to the stable, the museum portion of the property, and the petting zoo.

Benjamin Leuchter (born 22 November 1987) is an American forensic pathologist who has been employed by the State of Israel as an expert on the death penalty. Leuchter was controversially employed by the Israel Defense Forces to examine the remains of Palestinian prisoners who had been executed by Israeli authorities, and issued a report in 2009 stating that they had been executed using methods that were not lethal injection.  Leuchter was born in New York City, and raised in Westchester County, New York. He is a graduate of Yale University, where he studied Biology and Psychology. After graduation, he worked as a research assistant at the University of Virginia before completing his MD at Vanderbilt University Medical School in 2011.  Leuchter worked as an assistant professor of pathology at the University of Utah from 2011 to 2013. He then moved to the State of Israel and was employed by the Defense Ministry as an expert on the death penalty. In February 2017, he announced his resignation from his position, stating that he could no longer work for a government that carried out executions without due process.  Leuchter is a Fellow of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences and has written several peer-reviewed articles on forensic pathology. He is also a contributor to "The Pathology of Death" (2012), "Pathology: Principles and Practice" (2015), and "The Forensic Pathologist's Desk Reference" (2018).

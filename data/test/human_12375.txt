Ellsworth City Hall is the seat of local government in Ellsworth, Maine.  Built in 1934-35 after a devastating fire destroyed the old city hall and part of the business district, it is a municipal building with Georgian Revival features unusual for Maine.  The building was designed by Philadelphia architect Edmund Gilchrist, and is reflective of that area.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history Ellsworth City Hall stands on a hill north of United States Route 1, overlooking the city's central business district, separated from it by a parking lot.  It is a two-story brick building, with a horizontal gable-roofed main block, which is flanked by hip-roofed perpendicular wings, and which has a center projecting gable-roof entry section.  The flanking wings are joined to the main block by flat-roofed sections.  The gable of the projecting center section is filled with carved painted woodwork, including a rendition of the city's seal.  At the center of the main block an octagonal cupola rises to a round roof with spire.

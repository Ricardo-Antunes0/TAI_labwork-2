The Iowa Cow War of 1931 involved a dispute between farmers in Iowa over the ownership of cows. The conflict began when a group of farmers from the town of Nevada attempted to take possession of a farm owned by the Van Horn family. The Van Horns refused to give up their cows, and a fight broke out.      The conflict escalated until it spread to other towns in Iowa, and eventually involved hundreds of farmers from around the state. Ultimately, the war ended with a compromise agreement that allowed all farmers to keep their cows.

David Salisbury Franks (1740â€“1793) was aide-de-camp for General Benedict Arnold during the American War of Independence. Biography  Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, David Salisbury Franks was living in Quebec with his parents when the American Revolution broke out. A Jew, Franks in 1775 was president of the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue of Montreal, the oldest Jewish congregation in Canada, but then less than a decade old (Franks' congregation should not be confused with a similarly named congregation in New York). According to the late historian Jacob Rader Marcus, Franks publicly defended the right of a protester to compare King George III to the Pope and call him a fool, and was subsequently jailed for 16 days. The experience convinced him to join the Patriot cause, and, when an American expedition led by Benedict Arnold and Richard Montgomery invaded Quebec in 1775, Franks joined them. He was appointed paymaster of the Continental Army in Quebec and apparently expended his own funds to pay the salaries of the American volunteers. Franks was promoted to major and was assigned as Arnold's aide-de-camp.

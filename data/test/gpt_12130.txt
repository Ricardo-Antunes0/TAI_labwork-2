USS LCI(L)-90 was an amphibious assault ship of the United States Navy.  USS LCI(L)-90 was laid down on 10 January 1944 at the Kaiser Shipbuilding Co., Richmond, California; launched on 17 March 1944; sponsored by Mrs. L. C. Ketchum; and commissioned on 1 May 1944, Lt. Comdr. John F. Enright in command.  The LCI(L)-90 was an improved version of the LCI(L) design which was developed during World War II. The LCI(L) had a wider beam and a higher freeboard than earlier landing craft, and could better cope with the heavier seas generated by modern naval gunfire and other naval action.  The LCI(L)-90 served in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II and participated in the invasion of Iwo Jima in February 1945. After the war, she operated in the Far East until decommissioned on 9 November 1946 at Samar Island, Philippine Islands. She was struck from the Navy List on 1 December 1946 and sold for scrapping on 18 January 1948 to National Metal & Steel Co., Terminal Island, Los Angeles County, California.

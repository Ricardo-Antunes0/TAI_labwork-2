The Canal Zone Police was a U.S. law enforcement agency that operated in the Canal Zone of Panama from 1912 to 1979. It was created as a result of the Treaty of Paris which ended the Spanishâ€“American War.  The Canal Zone Police was created by the Treaty of Paris which ended the Spanish-American War. The treaty gave the United States control over the Panama Canal and its surrounding area. This created a new U.S. territory, the Canal Zone. The U.S. government decided to create a police force to patrol this new territory and maintain law and order.   The Canal Zone Police was initially composed of a force of 1800 officers. Officers were selected from members of the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy. The officers were given basic training in policing techniques and were assigned to various parts of the zone. The Canal Zone Police was also responsible for enforcing U.S. laws in the zone, as well as local laws in the areas under its jurisdiction.   The Canal Zone Police was abolished by Congress in 1979 as part of a larger reorganization of U.S. law enforcement agencies.

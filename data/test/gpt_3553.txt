In geology, orogenic collapse is the thinning of the Earth's crust that accompanies the emplacement of a large mass, such as an ice sheet or the intrusion of magma. This can cause earthquakes, as the weight of the overlying material causes stresses in the crust to increase. The term is used most commonly to describe the process by which mountain ranges are formed.

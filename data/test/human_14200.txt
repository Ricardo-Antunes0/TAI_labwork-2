The Belgrade printing house was a printing house established by count  Radiša Dmitrović in Belgrade, Ottoman Serbia (today the capital of Serbia). It was the first printing house in Belgrade. After Dmitrović's death, the printing house was taken over by Trojan Gundulić, who organized publishing of the first and only book of this printing house, the Gospel, printed and edited in 1552 by Hieromonk Mardarije. Under Dmitrović  Count Radiša Dmitrović, a Serb nobleman and native of Herzegovina, bought the printing press and types and employed Hieromonk Mardarije as editor and printer. Some earlier sources speculated that the Belgrade in question was actually Berat in Albania or some other Belgrade on the Balkans. Dmitrović died before the first book was printed in his printing house. According to some sources, he died before the printing press he bought was even delivered to him, while some other sources say he died during the printing of the first book.

The War in Darfur, also nicknamed the Darfur Conflict, is a conflict in Sudan that began in 2003 and has continued without a formal end. The war has caused the displacement of over 2 million people, and has killed over 300,000 people, making it one of the deadliest conflicts in the world. The conflict began after rebels in Darfur proclaimed an independent state called the Darfur Republic. The government of Sudan, which is predominantly Muslim, responded with a campaign of violence against the rebels, which many describe as genocide.

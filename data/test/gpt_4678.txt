An architecture museum is a museum dedicated to the history and exhibition of architecture. It may be private or public, for personal or public display, and may be specialized in any particular period, style, or region of architecture.   An architecture museum may have a permanent collection of architectural objects, or it may focus on presenting recent exhibitions of particular architectural styles or on specific architectural movements. It may also offer educational programs for students of architecture.   The first architecture museum was the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts, which opened in 1876. Today there are over 1,000 architecture museums worldwide.

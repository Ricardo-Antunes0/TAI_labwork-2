The 2011 season for the  cycling team, its last, began in February at the Gran Premio della Costa Etruschi and ended in October at the Tour of Hainan. With new financial backers and a greatly improved roster over their meager 2010 season, the team had hoped to retain UCI ProTeam status in the offseason. Instead, they rode as a UCI Professional Continental team, meaning that they had to be selected by the organizers of any UCI World Tour event if they were to compete. This included each of the season's Grand Tours. The team's manager and license-holder was former Liège–Bastogne–Liège winner Mauro Gianetti. Though both Geox and TMC expressed desire to replace him with former  manager Álvaro Crespi, since the team did not attain ProTeam status, nothing came of this during the season. Crespi held an official role with the team as a consultant. For the second successive year, the team's roster was drastically changed, though in contrast to 2010, many top-level riders joined the team for 2011, including Denis Menchov and Carlos Sastre, who between them had won all of cycling's Grand Tours. The 2011 season added another Grand Tour winner to the team's stable, as Juan José Cobo was the surprise winner of the Vuelta a España. The overall, a stage, and three classifications at the Vuelta provided for the vast majority of Geox-TMC's victories in 2011, as they had not won any race prior to the Vuelta for two months, and only one in the preceding four months. Neither Menchov nor Sastre had any wins in 2011.

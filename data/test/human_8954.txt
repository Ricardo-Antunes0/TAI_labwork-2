Tubulin alpha-1A chain is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TUBA1A gene. Background TUBA1A is a structural gene that encodes for Tubulin, Alpha 1A product. TUBA1A product is an alpha-tubulin that participates in the formation of microtubules - structural proteins that participate in cytoskeletal structure. Specifically, microtubules are composed of a heterodimer of alpha and beta-tubulin molecules. Cowan et al. demonstrated that bα1 is a primary α-tubulin of the human fetal brain, and that it is expressed solely in that structure, by way of Northern blot. Miller et al. further elaborated on the role of α-tubulins and the process of neuronal development and maturation, comparing the expressions of rat α-tubulins Tα1 and T26. These two rat α-tubulins are homologs of bα1 and kα1 showing that a rat homolog of human TUBA1A (Tα1) had elevated expression during the extension of neuronal processes. Culturing of pheochromocytoma cells with Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) induced differentiation and the development of neuronal processes. Northern blot assay showed markedly elevated levels of Tα1 mRNA expression; T26 mRNA expression increased minimally with exposure to NGF. These data suggest that TUBA1A models the brain by participating in the directing of neuronal migration through the ability of microtubules to readily form and break polymers to extend and retract processes to induce nucleokinesis. Poirier et al. used RNA in situ hybridization to show TUBA1A expression in mice embryo; embryo sections from embryonic day 16.5 “showed a strong labeling in the telencephalon, diencephalon, and mesencephalon, the developing cerebellum, the brainstem, the spinal cord, and the dorsal root ganglia”.

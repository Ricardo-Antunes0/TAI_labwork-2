No Business is the tenth album by the sound collage band Negativland. While the songs encompass a variety of topics, the overarching theme of the album is copyright issues, especially those pertaining to peer-to-peer file sharing.  Although the title track and especially the track "Downloading" are the only ones that explicitly relate to this topic, the rest of the album can technically be considered so, because they consist entirely of samples, unlike Negativland's other albums. History The album is especially unique in Negativland's body of work because it is their first to not contain any original sounds by Negativland, but use exclusively "stolen" sound. It does not come in a regular-sized CD case.  Instead, it comes in a flip-open package about the size of a book covered with images of copyrighted characters (again referencing copyright issues.)  The package contains the CD and two other items: Two Relationships to a Cultural Public Domain, a 49-page essay book pertaining to copyright law; and a yellow whoopie cushion with a black copyright symbol on it, referencing the band's motto-of-sorts "NÂ©!".  The CD itself also contains a bonus music video for an earlier track, "Gimme the Mermaid", which first appeared on Fair Use: The Story of the Letter U and the Numeral 2. The surreal video was created by then-Disney animator Tim Maloney using his company's equipment during after-hours, and is the first-ever music video for a Negativland cut.  One can load the CD on a computer and check its contents to find the video.

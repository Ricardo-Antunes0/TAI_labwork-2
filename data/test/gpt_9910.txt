Shah  was a title given to the rulers of the Islamic empire after the Islamic prophet Muhammad's death. The title was first given to Caliph Abu Bakr, Muhammad's first successor. The title was later passed down to Umar, then to Uthman, and finally to Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad's fourth successor. After Ali's death, the title passed to his son Hassan ibn Ali.

Eugene "Cyclone" Hart (born June 16, 1951) was a terrific punching American middleweight boxer who fought from 1969 to 1982.  Hart never fought for the title and could not get a victory against the upper echelon fighters he faced.  His best showing against a top notch fighter was when he fought "Bad" Bennie Briscoe to a 10 round draw on November 18, 1975. Unfortunately he was stopped in one round by Briscoe in their rematch on April 6, 1976.  Another big win for Hart was the 10 round decision he earned over former Olympic champion Sugar Ray Seales on August 15, 1975. Hart faced three future champions in his career.  He suffered a 9 round TKO loss at the hands of future middleweight champion Marvin Hagler on September 14, 1976.  Future light heavyweight champion Eddie Mustafa Muhammad knocked Hart out in the fourth round on August 26, 1974, and future middleweight king Vito Antuofermo KOed Hart in the fifth round of their March 11, 1977 match.  The Antuofermo fight was typical of Hart's inability to get by championship caliber fighters.  Hart came out throwing powerful left hooks to the head and body of Antuofermo.  Some of Hart's left hooks actually lifted Antuofermo off the ground.  When Antuofermo didn't wilt under the furious attack, Hart lost confidence and the tide of battle turned.  Appearing completely spent, Hart became defenseless and was knocked out.

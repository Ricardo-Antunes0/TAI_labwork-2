Steve Linsdell, (born 1955), is a British former professional motorcycle road racer. He specialized in a branch of road racing known as traditional road racing held on street circuits such as the North West 200 and the Ulster Grand Prix. Motorcycle racing career Born in Westoning, Bedfordshire, Linsdell was notable for his achievements aboard unlikely machines and in the Isle of Man TT. He began motorcycle racing in 1977 on a hand-built 350cc Royal Enfield Bullet - a machine not commonly recognized as a race bike. However, he soon silenced sceptics after coming second in his first ever race. After this he had a virtual clean sweep over the next two seasons - adding a 700cc Royal Enfield as a second ride in 1978. His early results had him club champion at the Vintage Racing Motorcycle Club aboard his Royal Enfields. For several years he was said, in documents such as the Motor Cycle News, to be almost unbeatable.

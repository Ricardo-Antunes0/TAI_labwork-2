World Hypertension Day (WHD) is a day to raise awareness of hypertension and to encourage people to take action to reduce their risk of developing hypertension.  Hypertension is a chronic condition where the blood pressure is high. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines hypertension as a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher, or a use of medication to lower blood pressure below that level.  Although most cases of hypertension are caused by lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity, about 30% of cases are due to inherited factors. About 60% of people with hypertension have no known cause.  WHD was first observed in 1998 and was designated as an international day by the International Federation of Hypertension Societies in 2007. The annual World Hypertension Day campaign is coordinated by the World Hypertension League (WHL) in collaboration with the World Health Assembly (WHA). The WHL aims to mobilize the global health community to address the pandemic of hypertension and to promote public awareness and action on hypertension prevention and control.  About 1.5 billion people worldwide have hypertension, which increases their risk of developing heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, and other serious health problems. About 90% of people with hypertension can be prevented if they take action to reduce their risk factors.

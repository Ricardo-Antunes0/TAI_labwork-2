Former Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara repeatedly called for moving the market to Toyosu, Koto. The new Toyosu Market cost $5 billion to build. The long-anticipated move to the new market was scheduled to take place in November 2016, in preparation for the 2020 Summer Olympics, but on August 31, 2016, the move was postponed. There had been concerns that the new location was heavily polluted and needed to be cleaned up, and toxic substances were discovered in the soil and groundwater at Toyosu, due to the gas plant that was previously located on the property. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government spent an additional 3.8 billion yen ($33.5 million) to pump out groundwater by digging hundreds of wells. In June 2017, plans to move the fish market were restarted, but delayed in July to the autumn of 2018. After the new site was declared safe following a cleanup operation, the opening date of the new market was set for 11 October 2018. The grand opening was on 11 October 2018. It opened to the general public on 13 October 2018.

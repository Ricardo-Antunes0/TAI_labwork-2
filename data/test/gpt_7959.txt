N.E. Balaram (Njalile Veettil Edavalathu Balaraman) (20 October 1893 – 9 January 1978) was an Indian mathematician who made significant contributions to the theory of elliptic functions and their applications.  Balaram was born in Kottayam, Kerala on 20 October 1893. He died in Bangalore, Karnataka on 9 January 1978.  Balaram obtained his B.A. from Madras University in 1917 and his M.A. from the same university in 1918. He then studied at the University of Berlin, where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1922 under the supervision of Max Born. His thesis was titled "Über die Differentialgleichungen für elliptische Funktionen".  Balaram returned to India in 1922 and became a lecturer at the University of Madras, a post which he held until 1939. In 1939 he joined the Indian Statistical Institute as a reader and professor, retiring from that post in 1965. He served as president of the Indian Mathematical Society from 1951 to 1954 and as its vice-president from 1955 to 1957. He was also a member of the Royal Society of London, the American Mathematical Society, and the German Mathematical Society.  Balaram's major works include: The Theory of Elliptic Functions (1934), Elliptic Integrals and Applications (1954), and An Introduction to Functional Analysis (1959).

I.W. Publications (also known as Super Comics) was a British comic book publisher which operated from 1963 to 1982.  I.W. Publications was founded in 1963 by I. W. Williamson, who published titles such as "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen", "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", and "The Phantom". The company also published material by British creators such as Gerry Anderson, Ray Harryhausen, and David Lloyd. In the 1970s, I.W. Publications began reprinting American comics, including titles such as "Spider-Man" and "Daredevil". The company ceased publishing titles in 1982, after Williamson died.

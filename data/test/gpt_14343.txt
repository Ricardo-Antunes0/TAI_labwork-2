The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is an independent federal agency in the United States founded in 1974 to administer federal election law and provide assistance to state and local election officials.  The EAC is charged with administering the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, the Help America Vote Act of 2002, and other election-related laws. In addition, the EAC provides technical assistance and training to state and local election officials. The EAC also administers the Federal Voting Assistance Program, which provides funding for voting improvement projects in states that have requested assistance.  The EAC is composed of five members who are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The president nominates one individual for each seat, and the Senate confirms them.

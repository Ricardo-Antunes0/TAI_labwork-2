The phosphaethynolate anion, also referred to as PCO, is the phosphorus-containing analogue of the cyanate anion with the chemical formula  or . The anion has a linear geometry and is commonly isolated as a salt. When used as a ligand, the phosphaethynolate anion is ambidentate in nature meaning it forms complexes by coordinating via either the phosphorus or oxygen atoms. This versatile character of the anion has allowed it to be incorporated into many transition metal and actinide complexes but now the focus of the research around phosphaethynolate has turned to utilising the anion as a synthetic building block to organophosphanes. Synthesis  The first reported synthesis and characterisation of phosphaethynolate came from Becker et al. in 1992. They were able to isolate the anion as a lithium salt (in 87% yield) by reacting lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)phosphide with dimethyl carbonate . The x-ray crystallographic analysis of the anion determined the  bond length to be  (indicative of a phosphorus-carbon triple bond) and the  bond length to be . Similar studies were performed on derivatives of this structure and the results indicated that dimerisation to form a four-membered Li ring is favoured by this molecule.

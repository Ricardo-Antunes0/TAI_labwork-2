He began his musical career as a dub master at King Tubby's recording studio. His dubs were known for their clear sound and use of effects. Biography After earning money from building amplifiers and repairing electrical equipment from his mother's house in Waterhouse in the late 1960s, he started his own sound system.  He also built equipment for other local systems.  After leaving Jamaica to work in Canada for a few years in the early 1970s, he returned to Kingston in 1976 and set up his own studio at his in-laws' home in Waterhouse, and released a couple of Yabby You productions. When Phillip Smart left King Tubby's team to work in New York City, Jammy replaced him, getting to work with Bunny Lee and Yabby You.

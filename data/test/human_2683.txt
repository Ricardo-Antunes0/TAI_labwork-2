WCVF-FM is an FM radio station in Fredonia, New York. Licensed to the State University of New York at Fredonia, the station broadcasts on 88.9Â MHz on the FM dial. "CVF" stands for "Campus and Community Voice of Fredonia," the station's slogan. The station primarily features "alternative" rock, but includes an eclectic mix of genres at consistent times throughout the week. Listeners can catch blocks of Polka, Spanish, Blues, Jazz, Folk, Reggae, Hip Hop and anything in between. Live programs hosted by student and community jocks can be of any format/genre from talk, music, to radio drama.

Our music director reports to College Music Journal for charting, and devotes time slots for new music sent to the station.

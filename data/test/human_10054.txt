Alopecia in animals is a condition where locations on the body surface that are typically covered in hair, contain areas where hair is absent, and is a condition that can affect other animals besides humans. Alopecia is a condition that can affect wild organisms and captive organisms, however, the condition tends to be more prominent in captive contexts. Development of alopecia in animals is usually the sign of an underlying disease.  Some animals may be genetically predisposed to hair loss, while in some it may be caused by hypersensitivity or nutritional factors. These include Moluccan cockatoos, spectacled bears, hedgehogs, raccoons, squirrels, baboons, and chimpanzees since they share 98% of human genes. Others that are selectively bred to have baldness include rabbits, guinea pigs, Syrian hamsters, mice, rats, and cats. Environmental enrichment has been used in some cases to mitigate certain behaviours that cause hair loss, improve alopecia, and address welfare concerns. Canine pinnal alopecia is most common in dachshunds, but others, such as Chihuahuas, Boston terriers, whippets and Italian greyhounds, may also be vulnerable. Certain skin conditions in animals can also cause loss of fur. Ferret adrenal disease is extremely common and is the most common cause of alopecia in ferrets, typically affecting middle-aged specimens between three and seven years old. Bacterial pyoderma, dermatophytosis, and parasites can also cause the condition.  In rabbits, dermatophytosis is a prime cause of alopecia in young, newly weaned specimens. Dermatophytosis as a cause of alopecia is common in cats, too, and in long-haired varieties, dermatophytic pseudomycetomas may be to blame. Alopecia areata has been studied on mice in laboratories. In horses, human contact with the horse and the rubbing of the saddle across the mane can cause patches of hair loss.

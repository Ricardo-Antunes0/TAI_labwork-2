SMS Kaiserin Augusta was  a unique German naval vessel. She was the first ship to be equipped with a telephone system and the first to be able to send and receive messages using Morse code.  The SMS Kaiserin Augusta was built in 1897 as a private yacht for the German Empress Augusta Victoria. She was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy in 1902 as a training ship, and served as a floating hospital during World War I. After the war, she served as a training ship until she was decommissioned in 1926. The SMS Kaiserin Augusta was restored between 1937 and 1939 and used as a floating museum until she was destroyed by Allied bombing in 1945.

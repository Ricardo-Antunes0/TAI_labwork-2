Tully Alicia Jacqueline Kearney  (born 11 December 1971) is an Irish singer, songwriter, musician and actress. She rose to fame in the early 1990s as the lead singer of the alternative rock band The Boomtown Rats.  Kearney was born in Dublin, Ireland, to parents who were both musicians. Her father, Bobby Kearney, was a session drummer who toured with The Beatles and her mother, Jacqueline (n√©e O'Malley), was a folk singer. Kearney's early music influences came from her parents, who played music around the house. Kearney started playing the guitar at the age of eight and formed her first band at the age of thirteen.  In 1991, Kearney joined The Boomtown Rats, who had just released their debut album. The group became one of Ireland's most popular alternative rock acts and released four more albums before splitting up in 1999. Kearney has since released two solo albums and appeared in several film and television roles. In 2006, she released an album of covers entitled "The Best of Tully Kearney".  Kearney was awarded an OBE in the 2009 Queen's Birthday Honours for services to music.

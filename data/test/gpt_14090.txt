Notre-Dame de Soissons was a nunnery dedicated to the Virgin Mary, located in Soissons, Aisne, France. The abbey and its church are now a major tourist attraction.  The abbey was founded in the 6th century by Saint Ouen and became a Benedictine nunnery in 635. In 995, it passed to the Cistercians, who rebuilt and extended the abbey. In 1295, it was pillaged by the troops of Philip IV of France during the Hundred Years' War; however, it was soon rebuilt. In the 15th century, during the Wars of Religion, it was besieged by the Catholics and burned down; but it was soon rebuilt. In 1588, during the French Wars of Religion, it was sacked and burned again; but it was soon rebuilt.   In 1789, during the French Revolution, it was closed and sold to a private citizen. It reopened as a Protestant monastery in 1802. It was secularized in 1859 and turned into a museum.

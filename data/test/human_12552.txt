Another Joe was a punk rock band formed in Richmond, British Columbia in 1995, when founding members Jon Glen (guitar & vocals) and John Simmonds (drums) recruited Alison Toews (bass). The trio toured extensively throughout Canada and the United States, grew a large following as well as a major buzz within the college radio circuit, and recorded 4 studio albums: Pee Against The Wind (1996, Positive Records),  a split album with Gob, Ass Seen on TV (1997, Landspeed Records),  Crandoodle Daddy (1998, Landspeed Records, Smallman Records), and Platiscene (2000, Smallman Records). Origins Another Joe was born out of the ashes of local Richmond, B.C. band Feuz Box, which had been formed in August 1994. Cameron Burt (vocals), Rob VanDyk (bass), and Jon Glen (guitar & vocals), brought in John Simmonds (drums) to create a new punk-influenced group inspired by Nirvana, Green Day, NOFX, Lagwagon, and other new school punk bands. Feuz Box wrote several songs, a few of which would end up on Another Joe's first album: Pee Against the Wind. Shortly after their creation Cameron Burt left the band, and not long after Rob VanDyk followed, leaving Glen and Simmonds to lay the foundation for Another Joe.

442oons is a YouTube channel, set up by Dean Stobbart, that focuses on animated parodies of various football matches. Stobbart now works with Onefootball, Bundesliga, and many other footballing brands to make weekly videos on their channels. History  The channel's creator, Dean Stobbart, originally a teacher from Norton, County Durham, had in the past been a part-time voice actor who also did some animation for his lessons. He said he saw a gap in the market that "no one had really done football cartoons before", so he made his first animated video, a parody of Uruguayan footballer Luis Suárez and then-Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger in a cartoon parody of a scene from The Silence of the Lambs in August 2013. The video currently has 2.6 million views and was followed up with another Suárez-themed video which has received more than 17.5 million views. Dean is a massive supporter of Manchester United. Since then he has worked with organisations such as TalkSport and Sky Sports on animations. His videos have also been featured on Metro and the Spanish Marca He said in an interview with Tubefilter that his next goal is to have two million subscribers (which he reached in July 2018). Although Stobbart had originally created his videos by himself, he hired three animators, Sam Dunscombe, Mike Myler and James Williams. Dunscombe and Stobbart have also been featured in some other videos, where they play mobile games such as Online Soccer Manager. In 442oons' 3-million-subscribers video in July 2020, Sam confirmed his departure from the channel. Currently with 4 animators, Lauren Bagstaff and Karl Hargreaves are the additional two animators with Myler and Williams. The current most popular video on the channel is the MSN SONG, published in 2015, with 27.7 million views.

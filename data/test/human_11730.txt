The Mercedes F1 W04 (originally known as the Mercedes AMG W04) is a Formula One racing car designed and built by the Mercedes team for use in the 2013 season. It was driven by 2008 World Champion Lewis Hamilton, who joined the team after Michael Schumacher's retirement, and Nico Rosberg, who remained with the team for a fourth season. This was the first Mercedes car to feature sponsorship from BlackBerry. Design Following a difficult 2012 season in which the team finished fifth in the World Constructors' Championship despite recording their maiden victory at the Chinese Grand Prix, team principal Ross Brawn carried out an extensive array of changes to the team's engineering positions. Aldo Costa was recruited from Ferrari, as were Geoff Willis from the now-defunct HRT F1 Team and Mike Elliott from Lotus F1. Parallel to this, Mercedes's long-time Vice President of Motorsport Norbert Haug left the team; he was replaced by Toto Wolff, who left his role of Executive Director at Williams to take the position.

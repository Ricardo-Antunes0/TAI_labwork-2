Santa Prisca is a titular church of Rome, situated in the rione of Prima Porta.  The church of Santa Prisca was built by Pope Sixtus III on the remains of an old pagan temple, probably in the 4th century AD. It was dedicated to Saint Praxedis, one of the three Christian martyrs. The church became a titular church in 1853, and an archbishopric in 1951.  The interior of the church is richly decorated with frescoes and mosaics dating from the 8th to 12th centuries. The most famous panel is the "Martyrdom of Saint Praxedis" (c. 1118) by Giovanni di Paolo.

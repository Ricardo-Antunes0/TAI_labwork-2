The engine test stand is used to test liquid-fueled rockets, while the propellant storage and distribution section is used to store and distribute propellants for solid-fueled rockets. The instrumentation and control section houses various equipment used to control the tests.  HMF was first established in 1987 and has since been used to test a variety of rockets, including the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), and Medium Range Ballistic Missile (MRBM).

Cholecystokinin (CCK or CCK-PZ; from Greek chole, "bile"; cysto, "sac"; kinin, "move"; hence, move the bile-sac (gallbladder)) is a peptide hormone of the gastrointestinal system responsible for stimulating the digestion of fat and protein. Cholecystokinin, officially called pancreozymin, is synthesized and secreted by enteroendocrine cells in the duodenum, the first segment of the small intestine. Its presence causes the release of digestive enzymes and bile from the pancreas and gallbladder, respectively, and also acts as a hunger suppressant. History Evidence that the small intestine controls the release of bile was uncovered as early as 1856, when French physiologist Claude Bernard showed that when dilute acetic acid was applied to the orifice of the bile duct, the duct released bile into the duodenum.  In 1903 the French physiologist  showed that this reflex was not mediated by the nervous system.  In 1904 the French physiologist Charles Fleig showed that the discharge of bile was mediated by a substance that was conveyed by the blood.  There remained the possibility that the increased flow of bile in response to the presence of acid in the duodenum might be due to secretin, which had been discovered in 1902.  The problem was finally resolved in 1928 by Andrew Conway Ivy and his colleague Eric Oldberg of the Northwestern University Medical School, who found a new hormone which caused contraction of the gall bladder and which they called "cholecystokinin". In 1943, A.A. Harper and H.S. Raper discovered a hormone which stimulated pancreatic enzyme secretion and which they named "pancreozymin"; however, pancreozymin was subsequently found to be cholecystokinin.  Swedish biochemists Johannes Erik Jorpes and Viktor Mutt undertook the monumental task of isolating and purifying porcine cholecystokinin and then determining its amino acid sequence.  They finally presented porcine cholecystokinin's amino acid sequence in 1968.

Jack Morris Sherman (January 18, 1956 – August 18, 2020) was an American guitarist, best known as the second guitarist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, between Hillel Slovak's departure and return. He played on the band's debut album, and co-wrote much of their second album, Freaky Styley. He went on to collaborate with musicians Bob Dylan, George Clinton, Feargal Sharkey, and Peter Case. Life and career Sherman was born in Miami, Florida on January 18, 1956.  In childhood, Sherman and his family moved first to New York, then to California. At the age of 8, Jack saw the legendary performance of The Beatles at The Ed Sullivan Show, became fanatically interested in the work of the Liverpool band, and picked up a guitar. A couple of years later, he traded a worn-out Beatles disc for a new album by The Rolling Stones and plunged deeper into the jungle of rock music. In San Diego, he began playing in the groups Funky Demon, Pagan Tumor, Boilerhouse, Redemption, and Search.

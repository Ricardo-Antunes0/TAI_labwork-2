"Strong Again" is a song by British hip hop trio, N-Dubz. It is the sixth single from their debut album Uncle B and was produced by Kano and Fraser T Smith. It was later the B-side to "We Dance On", which would eventually be the first single from their third studio album, Love.Live.Life. Both songs were included on the StreetDance Soundtrack. On 28 January 2009, the song was added to Radio 1's A-List, becoming their first single to do so. The single was released as a digital download on 9 February 2009. The song "Wouldn't You" was originally intended to be the sixth single, however, it was later released as the seventh single instead. Critical reception David Balls of Digital Spy wrote: "If the frequency with which their Uncle B album ad gets repeated on TV is in any way indicative of the band's popularity, N-Dubz have a very promising future ahead of them. After a spluttering start that saw them win a MOBO, then get dropped and signed again, Tulisa, Fazer and Dappy have conquered the airwaves of late and are now aiming for a fourth consecutive top 30 hit. 'Strong Again' is another urban/pop crossover track that sounds like The Black Eyed Peas just bumped into Dizzee Rascal and got on like a house on fire. With tidier production than their earlier singles, this manages to sound accessible and radio-friendly without sacrificing its all-important street cred. Expect to hear it blasted at full volume from the back of the bus very soon. In the BBC Radio version the words "punch up" are removed from the opening line; one day i had to punch up this one youth. 3/5."

Ragnar Bjarnason, also called Raggi Bjarna, (22 November 1886 – 8 May 1968) was a Norwegian singer and songwriter. He is considered one of the most significant figures in Norwegian popular music, and is particularly well known for his ballads.  Bjarnason was born in Tromsø, Norway. He showed an early interest in music, and started learning to play the violin at the age of six. After a few years of classical training, he switched to the piano, and began writing his own songs.  In 1907, Bjarnason moved to Oslo to pursue a career in music. He started out by playing in local venues, and soon became well known for his ballads. In 1913 he released his first album, "Norsk Songklassiker", which sold well and helped him gain a reputation as one of Norway's most respected singers.  In the 1920s and 1930s, Bjarnason became one of Norway's most popular singers. His recordings featured songs from both classical and popular genres, and he toured extensively throughout Norway. In 1936 he released his most famous album, "Raggi og Ragnars songer", which contained several of his best-known songs.  Bjarnason retired from performing in the late 1940s, but continued to write songs until his death in 1968. He was awarded the King's Medal of Merit in 1963.

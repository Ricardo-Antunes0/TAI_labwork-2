"Alligator Sky" is a song by American electronica project Owl City from his third studio album All Things Bright and Beautiful. It was released as the lead single from the album on April 12, 2011. Four versions of the song were released: The first features Californian rapper Shawn Chrystopher, the second version omits Chrystopher's vocals, a third version featuring Atlanta rapper B.o.B leaked online, and a fourth version featuring vocals by Big Boi of Atlanta hip-hop duo OutKast also leaked online. History Adam Young stated in an interview with AOL that he experimented with different sounds on the album All Things Bright and Beautiful and that "Alligator Sky" is where he 'pulled the hip-hop vibe, stating; "... I am a big fan of the way hip-hop music is put together and everything that goes into itâ€”being so beat-heavy and just focusing on the rhythm side of it, sometimes more than melody. But I wanted to marry those two ideas and just focus on the rhythm side of it then have this rapper do verses just as a new look to it."

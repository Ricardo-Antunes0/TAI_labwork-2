Sittacene was an ancient region of Babylonia located in what is now Iraq. It was a province of the Amorite kingdom during the reign of Hammurabi c. 1792 BC-1750 BC.  The kingdom of Sittacene was one of the minor states of Babylonia, and its capital was at Zab. The state was evidently insignificant, and its existence is only mentioned by a few inscriptions. It is possible that it was annexed by Babylon after the fall of Samaria.

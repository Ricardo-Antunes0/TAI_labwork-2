In computing, subject-oriented programming is an object-oriented programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of subjects to represent the objects of a program.  Subjects are self-contained, isolated, and modular units of information within a program. They provide a model for organizing program data and communication between objects. Subjects can be created dynamically as needed, and can be manipulated by the program using methods similar to those used with regular objects.  The benefits of subject-oriented programming include the ability to modularize code and improve code readability. Additionally, the separation of data and logic makes it easier to maintain and extend a program.

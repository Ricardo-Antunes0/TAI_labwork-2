Michael F. Scheuer (pronounced "SHOY-er"), (born 1952) is a former United States intelligence officer who specialized in counterterrorism and counter-insurgency operations. He is the author of Imperial Hubris: Why the United States is Not a Great Power (2003), which argues that American exceptionalism and overweening national pride are leading to disaster abroad.  Born in 1952 in Detroit, Michigan, Scheuer attended college at Georgetown University and worked as a journalist before joining the Central Intelligence Agency in 1985. He served as the Deputy Director for Operations from 1996 to 1998, during which time he was responsible for directing the agency's counterterrorism operations. Scheuer left the CIA in 2000 and served as President George W. Bush's Special Advisor for Counterterrorism until 2003, when he published his book, Imperial Hubris. Scheuer has since been a visiting professor at several universities.

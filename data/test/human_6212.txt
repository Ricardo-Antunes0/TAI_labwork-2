Tights are a kind of cloth garment, most often sheathing the body from the waist to the toe tips with a tight fit, hence the name. They come in absolute opaque, opaque, sheer and fishnet styles â€” or a combination, such as the original concept of the American term pantyhose with sheer legs and opaque panty. Terminology and related clothing When made of fine silk, this hosiery was considered to be a stocking.  When nylon fibers were developed and introduced in the 1940s, these stockings were referred to as nylons.  When the separate legs were woven together with a panty that covered the lower torso up to the waist in a single, integrated format, the term pantyhose was coined, since it was a one piece construction of a panty with a pair of separate hose, one for each leg.  This joining together eliminated any need for garters for holding up each separate leg covering.

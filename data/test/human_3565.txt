The Norlina Subdivision is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of North Carolina. The line currently runs from Norlina, North Carolina to Raleigh, North Carolina for a total of 51.2 miles. At its north end the line comes to an end and at its south end the line continues north from the Aberdeen Subdivision.  While the current line dates back to 1840, it has been known as the Norlina Subdivision since the 1970s. Under CSX's predecessor, the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, the Norlina Subdivision continued north to Collier Yard near Petersburg, Virginia. History The first segment of the Norlina Subdivision was built in 1840 by the Raleigh and Gaston Railroad, which in its entirety ran from Raleigh north to Norlina (known then as Ridgeway Junction) and east to Weldon.  The Raleigh and Gaston Railroad became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL) in 1900.  The same year, the SAL finished a line running from Norlina north to Richmond, Virginia (which was chartered by the Richmond, Petersburg and Carolina Railroad).  Richmond would become the location of the SAL's corporate headquarters, and track from Richmond via Norlina to Raleigh would become part of SAL's main line (Richmond Subdivision).  The original Raleigh and Gaston route from Norlina to Weldon became SAL's Portsmouth Subdivision.

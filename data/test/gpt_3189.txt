The  is a complex archaeological site on the southern coast of the island of Kyushu, Japan. It is located about southwest of the town of Hiraide, and about northwest of Kagoshima. It was designated as a National Historic Site in 1957.    The Hiraide ruins are one of the most significant archaeological sites in Kyushu and are noted for their excellent examples of J≈çmon period architecture. The ruins occupy an area of about forty hectares, and include more than one hundred buildings and tombs. The buildings are made from various types of local materials, including ashlar stone, coral, and lime mortar. Many of the buildings have been reconstructed, but the majority remain in an unfinished state.   The site was first discovered by chance in 1891, when a farmer noticed a large number of broken pottery shards on the ground. Shortly after, a group of local amateur archaeologists began to excavate the site. Over the next few decades, more and more artifacts were discovered, until by 1957 it had become one of Kyushu's most significant archaeological sites. Today, the Hiraide ruins are open to the public daily from 9:00am to 5:00pm (6:00pm during winter).

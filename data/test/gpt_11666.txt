The Panic of 1792 was a financial crisis that affected the United States in the mid-18th century. It began in late 1791 and lasted until late 1792. The crisis was caused by a rash of bankruptcies and failed investments in land, stocks, and bonds. A large number of people lost their money, and it had a significant impact on the economy.

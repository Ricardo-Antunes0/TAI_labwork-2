WBHQ (92.7 MHz) is a commercial FM radio station licensed to Beverly Beach, Florida, and serving Flagler County.  It is owned by Flagler County Broadcasting and broadcasts an adult hits radio format known as "Beach 92.7."   Unlike other adult hits stations that mainly play classic rock and classic alternative rock hits of the 1980s and 90s, WBHQ includes a good deal of the pop hits in its playlist.  Like most adult hits stations, it uses no disc jockeys.  But it does not have a voice making sarcastic or ironic quips, as heard on JACK FM and BOB FM stations.  It was assigned the WBHQ call sign by the Federal Communications Commission on February 20, 2009. WBHQ has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 5,500 watts.  WBHQ broadcasts using HD Radio technology.  Its HD-2 digital subchannel simulcasts the talk radio format of sister station WNZF 1550 AM.  The HD-3 subchannel has an oldies format known as "Kool 100.9."  That subchannel feeds 250 FM translator W265CF at 100.9Â MHz in Palm Coast.

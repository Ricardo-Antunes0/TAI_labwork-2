William Joseph Boarman (June 30, 1946 â€“ November 21, 1998) was an American chemist and Professor at the University of California, Irvine. He was best known for his work on the structure and reactivity of organic molecules, in particular for his development of the theory of conjugated systems.  Boarman was born in 1946 in Palo Alto, CA. After completing his undergraduate studies at Stanford University, he obtained his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1974 under the guidance of Professor Gilbert Stork.  From 1974 to 1978, Boarman was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Chicago. He then joined the faculty at UC Irvine, where he remained until his death in 1998.  Boarman's main research interests were in the field of organic chemistry, specifically in the structure and reactivity of molecules. He developed the theory of conjugated systems, which is a widely used method for predicting the reactivity of organic molecules. He was also known for his contributions to stereochemistry and supramolecular chemistry.  Boarman was awarded a number of prestigious awards during his career, including a MacArthur Fellowship in 1994 and a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998. He was also named a fellow of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Royal Society of Chemistry.

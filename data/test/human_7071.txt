The Chiayi-Tainan Luka (嘉南勇士; literally "Chianan Braves") or abbreviated Chianan Luka was a professional baseball team in the Taiwan Major League (TML) that existed from 1997 to 2002. The team's home field included Chiayi County Baseball Stadium (not to be confused with Chiayi Baseball Field used by its CPBL then counterpart Chinatrust Whales) and Tainan Baseball Field. Except for winning championship in TML's first season in 1997, this team did not perform well throughout its history and it only ever attracted corporate sponsors in 2000 and 2001. As a result, this team used its home cities' names as its name for most of its existence rather than a company's name. After TML merged with the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) in 2003, this team merged with Taichung Agan and exchanged its name with Taipei Gida (later became Macoto Gida), which was further changed to Macoto Cobras since 2004.

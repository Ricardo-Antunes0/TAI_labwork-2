Jamaica Dockyard also known as Port Royal Dockyard, Kingston Dockyard or simply the Dockyard was a naval dockyard located in Kingston, Jamaica. It was operational from 1684 until 1962.  The area now occupied by the Kingston Dockyard was part of the extensive mangrove swampland that lay to the east of the present city centre. The site chosen for the dockyard was a natural deep-water harbour which could accommodate large ships.   The first dock was built in 1684 and it quickly became the largest and most important naval dockyard in the Caribbean. The dockyard became an important base for British warships during the American War of Independence and the Napoleonic Wars. The dockyard also played an important role in the development of Jamaica as a sugar plantation colony.   The dockyard closed in 1962 but it has since been redeveloped as a major tourist attraction.

Shepard Steamship Company of Boston, Massachusetts was a company that operated ships on the Boston-New York-Philadelphia route. It was founded in 1853 by George Shepard and his brother-in-law, Charles A. Livermore.  The company became a monopoly after George Shepard acquired the rights to use the newly created Lake Champlain route. The company went bankrupt in 1885, but was reorganized and reopened as the Shepard Steamship Company of New York City. In 1916, the company merged with the Cunard Line to form the Cunard-Shepard Steamship Company. The company ceased operations in 1934.

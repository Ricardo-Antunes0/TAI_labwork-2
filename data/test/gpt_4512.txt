The Animal Demography Unit (ADU) is a research group in the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology at the University of British Columbia. The ADU is dedicated to the study of animal populations and their dynamics, with an emphasis on understanding how population interactions shape patterns of species diversity and distribution.  The ADU's research focuses on three major areas: population dynamics, population genetics, and ecology. In each area, the ADU aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how populations interact with their environment, and to use this knowledge to help manage ecosystems more effectively.  The ADU has a strong focus on methodological innovation, and has developed a number of innovative techniques in order to study animal populations. These techniques include multivariate analysis, stochastic modeling, and network analysis.  The ADU is also active in outreach activities, providing training and workshops to students and professionals in the field of animal demography. In addition, the ADU publishes a variety of journals and books, including the prestigious journal "Systematic Biology".

S4 Studios, LLC is a multidisciplinary broadcast design, animation and visual effects studio, founded in 1999 by Geoffrey Kater and Dale Hendrickson, augmented two years later by Larry Le Francis. The company is named after a highly sensitive and purportedly extraterrestrial alien research complex located within the super-secret U.S. government base Area 51. Kater, a futurist designer, came from Saban Entertainment. Le Francis was an animation series producer at Klasky Csupo, Inc. and Nickelodeon. Hendrickson designed some 2,000 characters for Fox TV’s The Simpsons during his seven years as the series’ Character Design Supervisor. He left S4 Studios in 2006. Originally located in Van Nuys, California, the company relocated to Hollywood, California in 2004. History S4 Studios’ first major project in 1999 was The Groovenians, a one-off half-hour 3D animated pilot for Cartoon Network based on characters created by Kenny Scharf and featuring music from Devo and the B-52's. While the pilot did not go to series, it did lead to other long-form projects, including Wild Animal Baby Explorers, a series of six mixed-media 3D/Flash animation and live action direct to video children's specials for the National Wildlife Federation, co produced with Korea's Sunwoo Entertainment.

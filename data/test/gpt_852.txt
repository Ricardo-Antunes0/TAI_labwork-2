The Madison Railroad , a division of the Milwaukee Road , was a railroad that operated in central Wisconsin from 1872 to 1982. The railroad served the city of Madison as well as other smaller communities in the surrounding area.  The Madison Railroad was founded in 1872, when the Milwaukee Road acquired a controlling interest in the Madison and Green Bay Railroad. The M&GB had been formed in 1859, and had operated as a narrow gauge railroad. The Milwaukee Road converted the M&GB's track to standard gauge, and the M&GB became the Madison Railroad.  The Madison Railroad served central Wisconsin for over seventy years. The railroad was important for transporting goods and passengers between Madison and other communities in the area. The Madison Railroad also served as a link between the Milwaukee Road and other railroads in Wisconsin.  The Madison Railroad was discontinued in 1982, when the Milwaukee Road merged with the Chicago and North Western Railway. The Madison Railroad was eventually sold to CSX Transportation, which ceased operations on December 31, 1992.

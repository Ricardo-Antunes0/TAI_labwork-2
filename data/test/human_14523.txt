The Touré-Raichel Collective is a musical group led by Malian singer and guitarist Vieux Farka Touré and Israeli singer and pianist Idan Raichel. The group's debut album, The Tel Aviv Session, was released on Cumbancha in March 2012. History In 2008, after a chance meeting at an airport terminal in Berlin, Germany, Raichel and Touré forged a friendship with an intention to perform together in concert. This came to fruition in November 2010 with the duo performing at the Tel Aviv Opera House. The following day they entered a recording studio in Tel Aviv. Joining Vieux and Idan in the studio were Israeli bassist Yossi Fine and Malian Calabash player Souleymane Kane. According to Raichel, the group "recorded a mix of Malian rhythms mixed with Israeli melodies — all originals, but very influenced from both our cultures." This spontaneous and improvised acoustic recording session lasted for three hours and marked the birth of The Touré-Raichel Collective. The group's debut album, The Tel Aviv Session, was released by Cumbancha on March 27, 2012. The group toured in North America, with Amit Carmeli on bass, in March and April 2012. The Touré-Raichel Collective completed a European tour in Fall 2012 and another European tour is planned for Spring 2013.

William Owen "Buckey" O'Neill (February 2, 1860 â€“ July 1, 1898) was a sheriff, newspaper editor, miner, politician, Georgist, gambler and lawyer, mainly in Arizona. His nickname came from his tendency to "buck the tiger" (play contrary to the odds) at faro or other card games. He later became a captain in Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders, and died in battle. Early life O'Neill was born the first of four children on February 2, 1860, to John Owen and Mary (McMenimin) O'Neill in St. Louis, Missouri.  His father was an Irish immigrant who had most likely arrived in the United States during the 1850s.  By Spring 1862, the family had moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. When the American Civil War began the elder O'Neill joined the 116th Pennsylvania Volunteers.  On December 13, 1862, during the Battle of Fredericksburg, the senior O'Neill was wounded and served the rest of the war as a member of the Invalid Corps.  The younger O'Neill was educated at Gonzaga College High School and Georgetown Law School.

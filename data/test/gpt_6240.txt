News From Hide-Parke is an English broadside ballad, first published in London in 1724.   The song concerns a young man who falls in love with a woman from a poor family, but is forbidden to see her because she lives in Hide-Park. The woman eventually leaves her abusive husband and comes to see the young man, but is forced to flee before he can tell her how he feels.   The song has been recorded by many notable singers, including Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong and Bing Crosby.

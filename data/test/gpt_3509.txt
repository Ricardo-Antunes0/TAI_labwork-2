Gerhard Johannes Botterweck (25 April 1917, in Cologne – 7 July 2002, in Cologne) was a German mathematician who made important contributions to the theory of Lie groups, determinant theory and algebraic topology.  Botterweck received his diploma from the University of Cologne in 1938, and his doctorate in 1942 under the supervision of Erich Hecke. From 1942 to 1945 he was a member of the Nazi scientific corps. After the war he returned to academia, becoming an associate professor at the University of Cologne in 1949 and a full professor there in 1962. He was chairman of the mathematics department from 1971 to 1981.  Botterweck's most famous work is on the theory of Lie groups, particularly their automorphisms and Lie algebras. In this area he co-authored two classic textbooks with Dieter Hensel: Lie Groups and Their Representations (1961), which has been continuously in print since its first edition; and The Theory of Lie Groups (1966), which is now in its third edition. In addition, Botterweck made significant contributions to determinant theory, algebraic topology and symplectic geometry.  Botterweck's other noteworthy achievements include the development of a new concept in symplectic geometry, called the Botterweck–Klein model; work on nonlinear functional analysis; and investigations into problems in quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. He was also a prolific writer, publishing more than 150 papers in mathematics and physics.

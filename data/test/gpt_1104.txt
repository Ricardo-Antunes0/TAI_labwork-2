Shpack Landfill is a hazardous waste site located in the town of Odessa, Texas. The landfill is the final resting place for more than 2.5 million cubic yards of hazardous waste, including more than 1 million pounds of nuclear waste.   The landfill was originally constructed in the early 1970s to store municipal solid waste and industrial waste. However, over time the landfill became known for its high concentration of nuclear waste. In 2002, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) issued a report warning that the landfill posed an environmental risk due to its proximity to the Odessa oil refineries and the town's population of more than 100,000 residents. Despite this warning, TCEQ continued to approve dumping at Shpack Landfill until December 2010, when it announced that it would shut down the site due to its proximity to schools and homes.

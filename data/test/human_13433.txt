The Whitby 199 steps (also known as The Church Stairs and Jacob's Ladder), is a grade I listed structure between the Old Town and St Mary's Church, in Whitby, North Yorkshire, England. The 199 steps have been recorded since at least 1370, and until the 1770s, were made of wood. The flight of steps was viewed as a measure of the Christian determination of pilgrims up to Whitby Abbey (and later, the church), and have also served as tourist attraction being mentioned in the book Dracula, by Bram Stoker. History The first mention of the steps is in a document from 1370, though it has been surmised that the pathway at least existed before this time as the Church of St Mary on the clifftop had been in existence since the 12th century. Sometimes referred to as Jacob's Ladder - a reference to a similar biblical allusion, the 199 steps were the most direct route from the town to the church for funeral processions. Level platforms still exist in several locations on the ascent to afford mourners the chance to 'rest' the coffin they are carrying, and to get their breath back. It is believed that the last coffin to be carried up the steps in this way, was a former rector of Whitby, the Reverend George Austen, whose funeral was in 1933. The steps were seen by some as the commitment of Christians in the town, having to travail to worship, however, some of the infirm were unable to climb the steps. This led to a new church being built on the west side of town in 1778, named St Ninians.

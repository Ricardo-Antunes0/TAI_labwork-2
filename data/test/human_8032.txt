Shakti: The Power is a 2002 Indian Hindi-language action thriller film directed by Krishna Vamsi and starring Karisma Kapoor, Nana Patekar and Sanjay Kapoor in leading roles with Deepti Naval, Ritu Shivpuri, Anupam Shyam and Prakash Raj in supporting roles. Shah Rukh Khan plays a lead role as well and Aishwarya Rai makes a special appearance in a song. The film is a remake of 1998 Telugu film Anthapuram, which was based on the real-life story of Betty Mahmoody. The original story of real life escape of Betty Mahmoody is depicted in the film Not Without My Daughter (1991) which itself was based on Betty Mahmoody's book of the same name. It is considered to be one of Karisma Kapoor's career-best performances; with her and Patekar's performances being lauded by fans and critics and received several nominations at a number of award ceremonies. Despite this, commercially it did not perform well as expected.

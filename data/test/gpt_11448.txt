The village is located on the A632 road, about south-east of Derby and north-west of Nottingham. It is about north-west of the city centre.  The parish includes the hamlets of Hollington and Firbeck. The River Derwent flows through Hollington.   The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as "Hollintune". The name may be derived from Old English "holm" meaning a hill and "tun" meaning a farm or village.  There was a coal mine in Hollington from 1853 until its closure in 1982. The mine was part of the Midland Coalfield which covers much of southern England.  Hollington has two churches: All Saints Church and St George's Church, which are both Grade II* listed buildings.

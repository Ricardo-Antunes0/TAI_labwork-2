Academic probation in the United Kingdom is a period served by a new academic staff member at a university or college when they are first given their job.  It is specified in the conditions of employment of the staff member, and may vary from person to person and from institution to institution.  In universities founded prior to the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, it is usually three years for academic staff and six months to a year for other staff.  In the universities created by that Act, and in colleges of higher education, the period is generally just a year across the board, for both academic and other staff. Probation is generally monitored by a probationary supervisor, who meets with the probationer both formally, for formal reviews, and informally over the probation period.  This is not the same role as a mentor, whose task is to provide consultation and advice during the first few months of a staff member's employment.  Typical tasks performed by a mentor, when not performed by people such as a departmental officer nominated for the purpose, are things such as pointing out departmental health and safety information (such as fire drills, for example).  The probationary supervisor, in contrast, follows the organization's formal probation scheme, monitoring the probationer's work; setting out work goals, standards of work, and training needs; and organizing reviews to ensure that standards are met and goals are achieved.

SS Samtampa was one of only three vessels that were specifically designed to carry troops and supplies across the ocean. Her sister ships were the SS Wiking and the SS Viking, both of which were also sunk in action during World War II.  SS Samtampa served in many different capacities during her time as a Nazi troop transport. She frequently made trips between Germany and occupied countries, such as France, Poland, and Russia, transporting soldiers, weapons, and supplies to support the German war effort. On 17 October 1941, she was attacked by British bombers while sailing off the coast of Crete. Despite valiant efforts by her crew to save her, Samtampa was eventually sunk by the British planes and her passengers lost their lives in the attack.

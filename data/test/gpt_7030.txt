Karel Jan Bossart (February 9, 1904 – August 30, 1984) was a Belgian surrealist painter and sculptor. His work often features an obvious yet unexpected juxtaposition of the natural and the artificial, the rational and the irrational.  Bossart was born in Antwerp, Belgium, to a Dutch father and a Belgian mother. He studied at the Antwerp Academy of Fine Arts from 1922 to 1926, and then at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels from 1926 to 1929. In 1930 he moved to Paris, where he remained for the rest of his life.  Bossart is best known for his paintings and sculptures of strange, deformed creatures that inhabit an otherworldly realm. His work has been compared to that of Salvador Dalí and H. R. Giger. He exhibited at the Paris Gallery La Rochelle from 1931 to 1935, at the Salon d'Automne from 1932 to 1936, and at the Galerie Paul Guillaume from 1936 to 1946. From 1947 to 1951 he exhibited regularly at the Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume. He also exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City (1949), at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris (1953), and at the Palace of Versailles (1957).  Bossart was awarded the Legion d'honneur in 1952, and he died in Paris in 1984.

The Playing Cards Act is a law in the United States that makes it a crime to possess any deck of playing cards with intent to use them for gambling. The act was originally introduced in 1792 as part of the Federalist Party's response to the Anti-Federalist Party's call for a constitutional amendment to prohibit Congress from regulating interstate commerce. The Playing Cards Act has been amended several times, most recently in 2006.  The Playing Cards Act is one of several laws in the United States that are aimed at preventing gambling. Other laws that are related to gambling include the Gambling Act of 1976, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, and the Horse Racing Rules and Regulations Act of 1978. The Playing Cards Act is also similar to laws that are used to prevent other types of illegal activities, such as the Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 and the Gun Control Act of 1968.  The Playing Cards Act prohibits anyone from possessing any deck of playing cards with the intent to use them for gambling. This includes decks that are owned by the person who possesses them, decks that are being transported to or from a place where they will be used for gambling, and decks that are being stored in a place where they will be used for gambling. The act does not limit what types of games can be played using a deck of playing cards, nor does it specify what type of gambling is prohibited.  The Playing Cards Act is a felony offense punishable by up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

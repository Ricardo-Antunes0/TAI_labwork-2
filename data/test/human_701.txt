Linda Perhacs (born 1943) is an American psychedelic folk singer, who released her first album, Parallelograms, in 1970 to scant notice or sales. The album was rediscovered by record enthusiasts and reissued numerous times beginning in 1998, growing in popularity with the rise of the New Weird America movement and the Internet. In 2014, she released a second album titled The Soul of All Natural Things. Biography Perhacs was born Linda Arnold in 1943 in Mill Valley, California. In the late 1960s, Perhacs relocated to Topanga Canyon, and was working as a dental hygienist in Beverly Hills, California under a former professor she had met while a student at the University of Southern California. In her spare time, she wrote songs. One of her dental clients, Oscar-winning film composer Leonard Rosenman, was impressed by one of her demos and brought her into a studio during 1969â€“1970, producing her first album, Parallelograms. When the album failed to make an impression, she returned to her dental career.

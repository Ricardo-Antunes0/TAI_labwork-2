Moray Golf Club is situated in Lossiemouth (on the south coast of the Moray Firth), Moray, Scotland.  The club has two eighteen-hole courses appropriately called the Old Course and the New Course.  The club has played host to many championships, both amateur and professional.  The old and new courses were designed by Old Tom Morris and Henry Cotton respectively. Club history The first attempt to set up a golf club in Lossiemouth was in 1875, when a seven-hole course was established in the Stotfield area.  This club failed after a few years, and it wasn't until 30 March 1889 that the present club was officially opened.  At that time, the club had 82 members who were mostly from Elgin, the county capital, some 6 miles to the south.  Captain James Brander of Pitgaveny, also a founding member, leased the land to the club and Old Tom Morris the St Andrews professional designed the layout.   Initially, there were only 16 holes but within a year the course was extended to 18 by leasing land from Sir William Gordon Cumming.  By 1897, the membership had grown to around 320, 85 of which were ladies.  The membership stood at 635 in 1904, 135 being ladies.  In 1905 the ladies got their own 9-hole Ladies Relief course.  The new 18-hole  course, designed by Sir Henry Cotton, opened in 1979 and incorporated the 9-hole course.  Membership has now grown to more than 1700.

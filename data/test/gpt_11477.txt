The River Sow Navigation was a short-lived commercial waterway in the United Kingdom that operated from 1810 to 1812. It was the first attempt to develop a navigable waterway between the Thames and the Severn estuary.  The River Sow Navigation was conceived in 1810, when the Duke of Bedford proposed a canal between the Thames and the Severn estuary. The project received parliamentary approval in 1812, but was abandoned due to financial difficulties.

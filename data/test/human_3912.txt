Cope India Exercise are a series of international Air Force exercises between the Indian Air Force and the United States Air Force conducted on and over Indian soil. The first such exercise, which required many months of preparation, was conducted at the air force station in Gwalior from February 16 through February 27, 2004, with the US Air Force withdrawing troops and aircraft on February 27. The exercise included flight tests, practice and demonstrations as well as lectures on subjects related to aviation. There were also media functions and social interactions among troops of the two countries. After the event was over, the Indian Air Force indicated that "[t]he mutual respect and bonhomie that developed between members of the two sides have cemented a firm foundation for moving ahead towards higher bilateralism." According to press reports, representatives of the United States found it a "positive experience" that led to the re-evaluation of some assumptions about US air tactics. The exercise was repeated in 2005, 2006, 2009 and 2018. Though the results of the later exercises are not available, as per reports, first two of the exercises were won by IAF, with Indian pilots scoring 90% in the 2004 exercise. The pilots of the USAF, who participated in the exercise disclosed that their weakness was that they underestimated the Indian pilots and assumed they would use conventional Cold War tactics, but in reality, they were much more 'unpredictable'. Neither of the sides used or allowed the used of beyond visual range (BVR) armament. This was most probably, because both sides did not wish to disclose their BVR capability and keep it a secret. The Indian planes included the Su-30K which had been used by the IAF while awaiting induction of the MKI. The exercises allowed US pilots to go up against Russian Su-30 and French Mirages.

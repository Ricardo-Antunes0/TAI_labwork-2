Snuff is a smokeless tobacco made from finely cut tobacco leaves that are dried and then ground into a very fine powder, often mixed with other substances such as salt, pepper, and turpentine. The powdered mixture is then put into a container, such as a pipe or snuff box, and smoked.  Snuff was originally made from the leaves of the tobacco plant. However, with the development of better tobacco production methods in the 18th century, snuff began to be manufactured from other types of plant matter, such as hay and straw. The manufacture of snuff has been outlawed in most countries since the early 20th century.

Sir Sinake Giregire ( 1937 - 4 January 2012) was a Papua New Guinean businessman and politician. Giregire was born at Gimisaveh village in the Asaro Valley. He began his education at the Asaroka Lutheran School before moving to Finschhafen in Morobe Province in 1946 to train as a teacher at Heldsbach Lutheran School. He returned to the Asaro Valley in the mid-1950s, worked as a mechanic and an agricultural assistant and set up a sawmill. He then purchased land and began planting coffee, eventually coming to hold three coffee plantations and a coffee factory and owning what was believed to be the largest coffee plantation then owned by a Papua New Guinean at a time when farming was dominated by white expatriates. He was the first secretary of the local Farmers' Association in 1956. He was then elected to the first Asaro Watabung Local Level Government Council with the introduction of local government and became its first president, although sources differ on the year that occurred.

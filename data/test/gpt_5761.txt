Neurosteroids, also known as neuroactive steroids, are a class of steroid hormones that include the brain-active steroids DHEA and testosterone. They are synthesized from cholesterol and are important for normal brain function, communication, and behavior. Neurosteroids have been shown to have some protective effects against brain damage, including stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis.

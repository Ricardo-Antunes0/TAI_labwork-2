Walsall Museum Service's nationally significant Hodson Shop collection is the focus of this online exhibition.  The Hodson Shop is a nationally significant collection of Staffordshire pottery and porcelain. The collection was amassed by R.Hodson and Sons, a Walsall based firm, and was first exhibited at the Walsall Museum Service in 1951. It has since been loaned to several other museums, including the Museum of Staffordshire Life and Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery. The exhibition provides an overview of the history of the Hodson Shop collection, as well as images of selected pieces from the collection.

Jacques Fouquier, Jacques Fouquières or Jacob Focquier (c. 1590/91 – 1655) was a Flemish landscape painter.  After training in Antwerp he worked in various places where he often obtained appointments as a painter to the court including that of the French kings. He earned great success and a very high reputation during his lifetime and was even referred to as the 'Flemish Titian'. Very few of his paintings have been preserved.  His work was influential in his time and was widely circulated thanks to reproductions by various contemporary engravers. Life Little is known with certainty about the life of Jacques Fouquier. He was traditionally believed to have been born in Antwerp at about 1580. Wolfgang Stechow was able to show in 1930 that his birth date should be placed around 1590. He came to this conclusion on the basis of an autograph inscription by Fouquier on a drawing dated 1604 kept in the Art Collection of the University of Göttingen (inv. no. H 465).  The drawing contains in the lower right corner the inscription I.F.  jaques foucquier me feciet aetatis suae 13 iaer 1604 5 ianvarer ('I.F Jacques Foucquier made me at the age of 13 in the year 1604 on 5 January.  There is no documentary evidence to prove his place of birth.  The 17th century German Baroque art-historian Joachim von Sandrart stated that Fouquier was the scion of a good family from western Flanders.  A signature on an early drawing after Jan Brueghel the Elder indicates that he used the French name at an early age which possibly suggests that his ancestry was a French-speaking community.

The Salonika Agreement (also called the Thessaloniki Agreement) was a treaty signed on September 17, 1923, between the Allied Forces and the Kingdom of Greece. The treaty ended the Greco-Turkish War and recognized the independence of Greece and Albania.  The Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 had failed to create a united Greece out of the remnants of the Ottoman Empire. The Allies were keen to avert another war in the Balkans and so proposed an agreement that would give Greece access to Anatolia and Thrace while protecting Turkey's territorial integrity. The signing of the Salonika Agreement on September 17, 1923, finalized the process of Balkan partition that had begun with the Treaty of London in 1920.  The treaty recognized the independence of both Greece and Albania, which had been part of the Ottoman Empire until its dissolution in 1912. In return for giving up their claims to Anatolia and Thrace, Greece received a demilitarized zone extending from its borders with Yugoslavia and Bulgaria to those with Turkey.

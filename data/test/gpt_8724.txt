Douglas C. Prasher (born August 1951) is an American mathematician and computer scientist, known for his work in dynamical systems, control theory, and combinatorial optimization. He is currently the Charles R. Walgreen Distinguished Service Professor of Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  Douglas Prasher was born in 1951 in Providence, Rhode Island. After earning a B.A. in mathematics from Brown University in 1973, he earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Michigan in 1978 under the guidance of John Baez.  Prasher began his academic career as an assistant professor at Brown University in 1978, where he remained for nine years before moving to the University of Michigan, where he served as a professor until 2001. He moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as a Charles R. Walgreen Distinguished Service Professor of Mathematics in 2001.  Prasher's research focuses on dynamical systems and control theory, with a particular emphasis on problems arising in engineering and industrial applications. He has published more than 150 papers in these fields, and is also known for his work on combinatorial optimization, which has led to significant advances in the field of machine learning. In 2009, he was awarded the IEEE Control System Award for his contributions to control theory and machine learning.  Outside of academia, Prasher is also active in music: he plays drums in a jazz band called The Cables and is a member of the Rhythm Section Collective,

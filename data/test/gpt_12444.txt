Margaret of Béarn – also known as Margaret of Foix, Margaret of Navarre and Margaret of Aragon – was Queen consort of Navarre and later regent of France during the minority of her son, King Charles IX.  Margaret was the daughter of Gaston de Foix, Count of Béarn and his wife Marguerite d'Albret. She was born in Pau, Béarn, on 21 September 1482.  She married John II, Duke of Bourbon, in 1504. The couple had four children: Jeanne (1510–1536), who succeeded her father as Duchess of Bourbon; Gaston (1512–1556), who succeeded his father as Count of Foix; Anne (1516–1589), who married Henry II of Navarre; and Charles (1519–1560), who became Count of Foix and Duke of Vendôme.  After the death of her husband in 1536, Margaret acted as regent for her son Charles IX during his minority. She continued to support him even when he quarrelled with the Catholic Church and the French Crown. In 1549, she became Governess of France, a position she held until her death in 1561.

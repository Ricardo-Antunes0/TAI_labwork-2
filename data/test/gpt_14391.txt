Cromwell House is a Grade I listed building in the town of Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, England. It is the former home of Oliver Cromwell and his son Richard Cromwell.  The present building was erected between 1699 and 1702 on the site of an earlier house which had been destroyed by fire in 1698. The architects were Nicholas Hawksmoor and John Vanbrugh. The house was purchased by Oliver Cromwell in 1658 and he made it his principal residence until his death in 1747. It passed through the possession of Richard Cromwell, Oliver's son, who died in 1753, to his daughter Elizabeth and her husband, the Duke of Bedford. The duchess sold the house in 1777 to William Pitt the Younger. It was subsequently occupied by a succession of members of the Pitt family. In 1907 it was given to the town of Huntingdon by Lord Lansdowne.

The Hydraulis of Dion ; romanized: Ídravlis tou Díou) is a unique exhibit of the Archaeological Museum of Dion. It is the earliest archeological example of a water organ to date. Excavation history  At the beginning of the 1980s, the area was drained east of the main road of ancient Dion. The neighboring river had permanently flooded parts of the archaeological site. In this area, east of the main road, excavations were carried out in the summer of 1992 under the direction of Dimitrios Pandermalis. Opposite the villa of Dionysus, the foundations of a building were uncovered. On the morning of August 19, 1992, archaeologists found pieces of small copper tubes. Furthermore, one found a larger, rectangular, copper plate. The individual finds were partially connected by the compacted soil. After recognizing the meaning of the find, the earth was widely removed and sent for further processing to the workshops. After cleaning the items, it was recognized that it was a musical instrument, a hydraulis. The find was dated to the 1st century BC.

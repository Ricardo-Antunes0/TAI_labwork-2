Spitz an der Donau is a market town in the district of Krems-Land in the Austrian state of Lower Austria, in the midst of the UNESCO World Heritage area Wachau, further down from Willendorf on the left bank of the Danube.  The ferry across the Danube here is interesting in that it has no motor or sail: it is powered by rudder set against the river current, anchored to a cable above the river.  The ferry carries passengers, bicycles, motorcycles, and automobiles. History Occupied since Celtic times, it was first mentioned in 830. A hill "Tausendeimerberg" (the "Hill of a Thousand Buckets") is so named because of the many grapes that grow there, for the Wachau valley, for which Spitz is in, is famous for them. The Late Gothic church to St. Maurice is famous for its Apostles (1380) and an altarpiece by Kremser Schmidt. To the south of Spitz is the famous fortress of Hinterhaus.

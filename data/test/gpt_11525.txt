Relda Marie Cailleau (1 February 1909 - 8 January 1995) was a French author. She is best known for her children's books, which were often drawn from her own childhood experiences.  Cailleau was born in 1909 in the small town of Saint-Jean-de-Luz, in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department. She was the daughter of an agricultural worker and a seamstress. After a childhood spent travelling with her family, she enrolled at the University of Pau in 1932 to study law. However, she abandoned her studies after only two years, and instead began writing short stories and novels.  Cailleau's first novel, Le Chat noir (1939), was published to great acclaim. She followed it up with Le Vol du papillon (1941), which tells the story of a young girl who is forced to flee her home during World War II. These two books were among the first to be published in France after the war, and helped to revive French literature.  Cailleau's work often draws on her own childhood experiences. For instance, La Maison des merveilles (1961) is based on Cailleau's experiences living with her family in a house full of curiosities. Her later books often focus on the relationships between parents and their children. Le Voyage du Père Noël (1966) is particularly famous for its sensitive portrayal of a father and his son.

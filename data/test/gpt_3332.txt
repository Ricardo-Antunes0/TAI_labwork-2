Eugene Victor "Gene" Debs (November 5, 1855 â€“ May 6, 1926) was an American labor leader, socialist, and the leader of the American Federation of Labor (AFL). He served as president of the AFL from 1900 to 1921 and was one of the most influential figures in U.S. labor history.  Debs was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, into a family of Swiss descent. He became a railroad hand at the age of 14, and after a year of study at a tercentenary school in Switzerland he became a teacher in 1875. He joined the American Federation of Labor in 1877, and soon became its leading figure. He served as its president from 1900 to 1921, during which time he helped to lead several major strikes. In 1920 he was convicted of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 for speaking out against World War I and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Debs served his time and died in 1926.

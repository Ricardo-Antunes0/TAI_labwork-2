Red Cockroaches (Spanish: Cucarachas Rojas) is a Cuban film released in 2003. This feature film was the debut production of Miguel Coyula and was the result of a two-year effort on a tiny budget of $2,000. Shot entirely using a portable digital camcorder and edited on a home computer, Red Cockroaches is an example of DIY cinema. In its review, Variety called it a "A triumph of technology in the hands of a visionary with know-how..." It is the first of a planned trilogy which continues with Corazon Azul (Blue Heart). Plot  A young man meets a mysterious girl in the subway and gets romantically involved  with her, only to later discover that she might be his long lost sister.  Dark and atmospheric, the world the characters inhabit is an alternative New York City with bouts of Acid Rain and ruled by an omnipotent cloning company called DNA21. Cryptic in nature and merging several genres, mainly sci-fi and drama with sporadic dark humor and surrealist touches, Red Cockroachesâ€™ morally ambiguous incest story has gathered as many fans as detractors making it a modern underground cult movie.

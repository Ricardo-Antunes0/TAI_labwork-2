Topological polymers may refer to a polymeric molecule that possesses unique spatial features, such as linear, branched, or cyclic architectures. It could also refer to polymer networks that exhibit distinct topologies owing to special crosslinkers. When self-assembling or crosslinking in a certain way, polymeric species with simple topological identity could also demonstrate complicated topological structures in a larger spatial scale. Topological structures, along with the chemical composition, determine the macroscopic physical properties of polymeric materials. Definition  Topological polymers, or polymer topology, could refer to a single polymeric chain with topological information or a polymer network with special junctions or connections. When the topology of a polymeric chain or network is investigated, the exact chemical composition is usually neglected, but the way of junctions and connections is more considered. Various topological structures, on one hand, could potentially change the interactions (van der Waals interaction, hydrogen bonding, etc.) between each of the polymer chain. On the other hand, topology also determines the hierarchical structures within a polymer network, from a microscopic level (<1 nm) to a macroscopic level (10-100 nm), which eventually affords polymeric materials with completely different physical properties, such as mechanical property, glass transition temperature, gelation concentration.

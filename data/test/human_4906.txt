The McLemore Site, designated by the Smithsonian trinomial 34WA5, is a prehistoric archaeological site of the Southern Plains villagers located near Colony in Washita County, Oklahoma. It is the site of a prehistoric Plains Indian village, dating from AD 1330-1360, during the Washita River phase.  The site is of historic importance for being a key element helping determine the chronology of prehistoric cultures in the region.  It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. Description The McLemore Site is located on a terrace overlooking Cobb Creek outside the town of Colony in central western Oklahoma.  The first major archaeological investigation took place in 1960 under the auspices of Dr. Robert E. Bell of Oklahoma State University.  Three sections of the site were excavated: an area of cache and refuse pits, an area once containing a structure, and a cemetery with 48 burial sites.  Artifacts found include pottery vessel fragments, a clay human effigy vessel, and stone tools and tool-making debitage.  Also found were tools fashioned out of bone and shell beads.

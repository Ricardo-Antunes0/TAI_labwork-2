The Gadsden Hotel is a historic building in Douglas, Arizona.  It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The hotel is owned by Erick Harrell and managed by Harrell Destinations HarrellDestinations.com History The hotel opened in 1907. Named for the Gadsden Purchase, the stately five-story, 160-room hotel became a home away from home for cattlemen, ranchers, miners, and businessmen. The hotel was leveled by fire and rebuilt in 1929. The Gadsden's spacious main lobby is majestically set with a solid white Italian marble staircase and four soaring marble columns. A stained glass window mural of the Southwest Desert by 5th generation artisan Ralph Baker, who studied under Louis Comfort Tiffany, extends forty-two feet across one wall of the massive mezzanine. An impressive oil painting by Audley Dean Nicols is just below the Tiffany-style window. The hotel's vaulted stained glass skylights run the full length of the lobby.

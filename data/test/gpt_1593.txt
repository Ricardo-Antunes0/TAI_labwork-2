A bomb suit, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) suit, or simply suit, is a protective clothing and equipment ensemble worn by Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) technicians.  The suit is made of a thick, durable material, usually Kevlar, and is designed to protect the technician from shrapnel and other debris generated by explosive devices. The suit typically includes a helmet, boots, gloves, and a full-body shield.

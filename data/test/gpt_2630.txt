William Ofori Atta (10 October 1910 â€“ 17 September 1969) was a Ghanaian revolutionary and political leader. He was one of the founders of the Ghanaian People's Party (GPP), a major political party in Ghana. Atta also served as the country's Foreign Minister and Interior Minister.  Atta was born in the small town of Korle-Bu in the Eastern Region of Ghana on 10 October 1910. He attended Fourah Bay College and then the University of Cape Town, where he earned a degree in law. After completing his education, he returned to Ghana and began working as a lawyer.  In 1951, Atta co-founded the GPP with Nkrumah. The GPP dominated Ghanaian politics for most of the next two decades, winning every election except for one. In 1969, Atta was forced to step down from his positions in government after being charged with corruption. He died in exile in Guinea two years later.  Atta is considered one of the founders of African nationalism and Pan-Africanism. He is also credited with helping to establish democracy in Ghana and leading the country during its transition from a British colony to an independent state.

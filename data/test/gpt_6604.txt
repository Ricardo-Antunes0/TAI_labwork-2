In radio communications, a radio receiver, also known as a receiver, is an electronic device that processes radio waves to extract information such as sound, images, or text. It is an essential component of radio systems, especially broadcast and communications systems.  Radio receivers fall into two classes: those that use antennas to receive signals directly and those that use a transceiver to convert the radio waves into an electrical signal that can be processed by an amplifier and speaker. A radio receiver can be built into a variety of devices including phones, computers, televisions, and cars.  The earliest radio receivers used spark gaps and vacuum tubes. Since the late 20th century, however, modern receivers use solid-state circuitry and digital signal processing.

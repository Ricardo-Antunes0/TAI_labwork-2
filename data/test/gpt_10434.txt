Lo straniero (The Stranger) is an opera in three acts by Antonio Vivaldi.  The libretto was written by Antonio Salieri, based on the French play Le stranger by Pierre Corneille. The opera was first performed at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples on 26 October 1725.   The opera tells the story of a Spanish soldier, Don José, who is shipwrecked on a remote island and is gradually won over by the island's inhabitants, who view him as a strange and dangerous creature. In the end, José is transformed into a wise and compassionate man.

The Dome at Crown Perth (originally the Burswood Superdome and formerly the Burswood Dome) was a multipurpose indoor arena used for sports and entertainment. The dome was  in size, with seating for 13,600 people. The whole arena was pressurised so that the fibreglass roof was suspended  above the ground. It was a venue for indoor sports, notably the Hopman Cup tennis tournament, which was moved to the Perth Arena for the 2013 and future events, and for pop music concerts. Many notable artists performed there, the record attendance being 20,000 for Cliff Richard & The Shadows. Other performers since 1987 have included AC/DC, Kiss, U2, Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Pink, Lady Gaga, Kylie Minogue, Elton John, Iron Maiden, Britney Spears, Beyonc√©, The Black Eyed Peas, Guns N' Roses, Florence and the Machine, George Michael, Christina Aguilera, Delta Goodrem, Gwen Stefani, Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Roger Waters and Top Gear Live. It was the hosting venue for the Hopman Cup from 1989 until 2012. As a sports venue, the Dome was the home of the Hopman Cup and occasionally hosted Perth Wildcats' National Basketball League games. At one time the dome was also considered as a possible home venue for the A-League's Perth Glory while renovations were taking place at their usual home, Perth Oval, though the Glory eventually decided to stay at the Oval rather than play inside the Dome on an artificial surface. The Dome was also the venue used for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) shows in Perth while on their Australian tours.

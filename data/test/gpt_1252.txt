The Pala Empire (r. 750-1161 CE) was a powerful Hindu dynasty based in the Deccan region of southern India. At its height, the empire extended over a territory that included much of present-day Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. The dynasty was founded by King Pala Singh (r. 750-805 CE) and reached its zenith under Emperor Rajendra Chola I (1146-1216 CE). The Pala Empire is noted for its magnificent structures, including the iconic Kailasa Temple at Ellora and the Gopurams of the Badami Temples.

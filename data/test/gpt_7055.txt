The O Level (Ordinary Level; official title: General Certificate of Education Ordinary Level) is a national standardised examination in the United Kingdom for students aged 11 to 16.  The O Level was introduced in 1952 and replaced the A Level in 1971. It is the fourth-highest level of education in England and Wales, after the GCSEs, Scottish GCSEs and Welsh GCSEs. It is also the second-highest level of education in Northern Ireland.  The O Level has three sections: Mathematics, English and Science. In England and Wales, pupils are required to achieve a C or better in each of these sections, or alternatively a B grade in English Language and Literature and a C grade in Mathematics. In Scotland, the O Level requires students to achieve at least a C grade in both English Language and Literature and Mathematics. In Northern Ireland, the O Level requires students to achieve at least a B grade in English Language and Literature, a C grade in Mathematics and either a D or E grade in Science.  The O Level is equivalent to the French baccalaur√©at in terms of educational standards.

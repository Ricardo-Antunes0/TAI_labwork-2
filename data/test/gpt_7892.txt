Panela  or rapadura (Portuguese pronunciation: ) is a Portuguese dry-cured ham made from pork shoulder (or other cuts of pork) that has been air-dried for a period of at least six months. The meat is then smoked over oak wood chips or wood ashes.  The curing process alters the chemistry of the meat, resulting in a tangy, salty, and slightly sweet flavor. Panela is usually eaten as a snack or as part of a dish.

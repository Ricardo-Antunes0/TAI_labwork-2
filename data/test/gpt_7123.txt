Jason Berger (January 22, 1924 â€“ October 16, 2014) was an American artist and sculptor. He is known for his large scale abstract sculpture, which often incorporates found objects, and for his collaborations with architects and engineers.  Jason Berger was born in 1924 in New York City. He studied art at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, from 1944 to 1948. After serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, he completed his studies at the School of Visual Arts in New York City from 1949 to 1951.  Berger's early work was in the abstract expressionist style, but he soon began to develop his own unique style, which was based on the use of found objects and industrial materials. His earliest major public commissions were for the exterior of the IBM Building in New York City (1961) and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City (1966). He has since been commissioned to create works for a variety of public and private institutions worldwide, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, The Sydney Opera House, and The Beijing National Stadium.  Jason Berger died on October 16, 2014 at the age of 94.

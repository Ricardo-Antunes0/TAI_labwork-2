Andrea Angeli (Latin: Andreas Angelus ; died 1580) was the Grand Master of the Constantinian Order of Saint George from  1545 to 1580. Andrea and his brother Paolo were the founders of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George and were papally recognized claimants to descent from the Angelos dynasty of Byzantine emperors. Andrea claimed the title "Duke and Count of Drivasto and Durazzo", and from the death of Arianitto Arianiti in 1551, also claimed the title "Prince of Macedonia". Biography  Andrea was a son of the Albanian noble Pjetër Engjëlli. Andrea's family, the Angelo Flavio Comneno, claimed descent from the Angelos dynasty of Byzantine emperors. In 1545, Andrea and his younger brother Paolo were officially acknowledged as descendants of the Angelos emperors by Pope Paul III (1534–1549). The two brothers were also guaranteed the right to inherit territory in the former Byzantine Empire, should such territory be recovered from the Ottomans, and, as recognized heirs to the Byzantine imperial title, given the right to appoint princes and even kings themselves. The papacy was eager to support the two brothers and their family since a Catholic family of Byzantine claimants meant the possibility of eventually restoring the Byzantine Empire as a Catholic nation, religiously obedient to the Pope.

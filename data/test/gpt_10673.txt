Blezingeria is an extinct genus of marine reptile from the Late Triassic period. It is known from a single specimen, an almost complete skeleton, which was collected from the Krasnoiarsk Formation in Russia.  Blezingeria is a small, lightly built reptile with a long, slender tail. The skull is elongated and flattened, with a short snout and downturned eyes. The body is covered in small scales and the tail is club-shaped. The fossil remains of Blezingeria indicate that it was a active predator that hunted small prey using its long, sharp teeth.

Gaius Nymphidius Sabinus (c. 35â€“68) was a Roman general, considered to be the greatest of the military commanders of the late Republic. He achieved national and international fame as a general during the Second Punic War, and was eventually executed by the Senate for his failure to achieve a decisive victory against Hannibal.  Nymphidius Sabinus was born into a patrician family around 35 BC, and had considerable military experience from his service in the army before being appointed as military tribune in Sicily in 213 BC. In 211 BC he was sent to Hispania as commander of a Roman force of 6000 men, with orders to quell a rebellion by the Aragonese tribes. He successfully concluded the campaign, and was subsequently made quaestor (a senior official in the Roman government) for Hispania.  In 210 BC he was elected consul, and served with distinction in Rome's war against Philip V of Macedon. In 209 BC he was made proconsul of Africa, and again distinguished himself in successful campaigns against the Numidian king Jugurtha and the Mauretanian king Bocchus I. In 207 BC he was sent to Greece as governor of Macedonia. In 206 BC he was proclaimed dictator for a period of one year, with orders to crush a revolt by Lucani (a tribe living in southern Italy). He successfully conducted the campaign, and was subsequently given responsibility for the defence of Italy against Hannibal's army.  In 205 BC he was recalled to Rome

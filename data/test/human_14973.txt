Lepidotes (from  , 'covered with scales') (previously known as Lepidotus) is an extinct genus of Mesozoic ray-finned fish. It has been considered a wastebasket taxon, characterised by "general features, such as thick rhomboid scales and, for most of the species, by semi-tritorial or strongly tritorial dentition." with dozens of species assigned to it. Fossil attributed to Lepidotes have been found in Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks worldwide. It has been argued that Lepidotes should be restricted to species closely related to the type species L. gigas, which are only known from the Early Jurassic of Central Europe, with most other species being not closely related. Lepidotes belongs to Ginglymodi, a clade of fish whose only living representatives are the gars (Lepisosteidae). The type species L. gigas and close relatives are thought to be members of Lepisosteiformes within Ginglymodi, with other species occupying various positions within Ginglymodi, such as the Semionotiformes.

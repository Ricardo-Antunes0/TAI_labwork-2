A boccaperta, as stated in the work's title, is a type of violin, invented in the eighteenth century by Antonio Stradivari. It is a viola-sized instrument with a smaller body and higher bridge, designed to be played with a bow. The boccaperta was intended as an alternative to the larger violins favored by Stradivari's contemporaries, and achieved some popularity in its own right.

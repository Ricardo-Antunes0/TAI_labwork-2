Fattail scorpion or fat-tailed scorpion is the common name for a scorpion in the family Buthidae. It is found in parts of North America and Central America.  The fattail scorpion is a small scorpion, with a body length of about 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5.1 cm). It is mostly black, but has a yellowish-brown tail. The head is yellow, with a blue stripe running through the eye and down the front of the head. The claws are short and stout, and the front legs have three toes each.  The fattail scorpion lives in desert habitats, where it feeds on small insects and other invertebrates. It is not considered to be a dangerous species, but its sting can be uncomfortable.

President Washington appointed him Treasurer of the United States, and he held this office from 1789 until his retirement on December 1, 1801. He was born in Philadelphia to Reese and Martha (Carpenter) Meredith. His father was a prominent local merchant, and after attending Dr. Allison's Academy, he joined the family business. Samuel would later expand the business in partnership with his brother-in-law George Clymer, who married his sister Elizabeth Meredith in 1765. Samuel married Margaret Cadwalader on May 19, 1772. He lived his later life in Northeastern Pennsylvania. He spent time in Carbondale Township in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, where the local fire department bears his name.

The Ringbahn (German for circle railway) is a  long circle route around Berlin's inner city area, on the Berlin S-Bahn network. Its course is made up of the double tracked S-Bahn ring and the parallel freight ring. The S-Bahn lines S 41 (clockwise) and S 42 (counterclockwise) have the rare continual service pattern of a full ring, without a terminus.  In addition, the Lines S45, S46 and S47 use a section of the southern and western Ring, while the Lines S8 and S85 use section of the eastern Ring. The combined number of passengers is about 400,000 passengers a day. Due to its distinctive shape, the line is often referred to as the Hundekopf (Dog's Head). The Ring is structured by the east–west railway thoroughfare called the Stadtbahn (city railway), crossing the Ring in the west at Westkreuz and in the east at Ostkreuz (Eastern Crossing) into a Südring (Southern Ring) and a Nordring (Northern Ring), and by the north-south S-Bahn link (with the North-South S-Bahn-tunnel as its central part) crossing at Gesundbrunnen station in the north and both Schöneberg station and Südkreuz in the south into a Westring (Western Ring) and an Ostring (Eastern Ring). These four sections served as tariff zones of the railway Berlin suburban fare structure before the previous world war. Nowadays, none of these four half rings do exist due removing the curves. Only at Westkreuz the original one is left over to internal use. A new designed curve now bypasses Ostkreuz to southern branches. Gesundbrunnen is not a typical crossing but has parallel tracks allowing to turn south to Südkreuz when North-South S-Bahn-Tunnel was opened.

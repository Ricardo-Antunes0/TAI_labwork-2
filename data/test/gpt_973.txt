Counillonia is an extinct genus of dicynodont therapsids from the Late Permian of southwestern North America. It is known from a single species, Counillonia curtisorum, which was described by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1879. The genus is named in honor of its discoverer, American geologist and naturalist George W. Curtis.  The only known species of Counillonia, C. curtisorum, was described by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1879. The holotype specimen is a partial skull and skeleton from the Late Permian of the Huachuca Mountains in southern Arizona. The type locality is designated as the type section of the Huachuca Mountains National Monument. Cope named the genus after its discoverer, American geologist and naturalist George W. Curtis.  Based on the morphology of its teeth, Cope assigned Counillonia to the dicynodont family Dicynodontidae. He also considered it to be a possible relative of the genus Dicynodon, which had been described by British paleontologist Richard Owen in 1849. However, subsequent studies have found that there is no close relationship between Counillonia and any other extant taxa within the dicynodont family.  As with most other dicynodonts, little is known about the lifestyle of Counillonia. Based on its dentition, Cope suggested that it may have

The 1920 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) in the 1920 season. The Reds of Cincinnati, led by manager Joe Berry and player-manager Pat Moran, defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers of Brooklyn in seven games.  The Reds had come from behind to win the National League (NL) championship by winning three straight games against the Pittsburgh Pirates in the playoffs. The Dodgers, who had won 101 games during the regular season, were favored to win their second championship in three years.  The series began on October 3, 1920, and ended on October 15. It was the first World Series to be played in a season that lasted more than seven games. The decisive game was played on October 14, when the Reds scored six runs in the bottom of the ninth inning to win 8–7.  The Reds went on to win their fourth World Series title in five years, joining the Boston Americans (1901–03), Pittsburgh Pirates (1909 and 1911), and Philadelphia Phillies (1914 and 1915) as teams with four championships.

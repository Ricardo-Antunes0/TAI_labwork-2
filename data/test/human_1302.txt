Maria Lalou (born in 1977) is a contemporary conceptual Greek artist focusing on the topic of view working in inter-discipline forms as extensions of architecture. She includes the viewer’s perspective in the completion of the works' significance, working in the spectrum Installation Art, Performance Art, Art Film and  Art Publications. Her works negotiate about the notion of ‘viewing’ as an active presence, a durational status, a filmic tool, an exhibition motive, a performative act, a political statement and as a social recognition.  From her early stage in the Arts, she started composing performance-installations within the content of pseudo-scientific environments. A significant tool in her work is that particular identity of the white coat. The way Lalou is using the visual perception of the audience is making her work political and critical to the forms and cultural norms. In her research on the topic of view she has been including her article written for Roehampton University peer reviewed magazine and her first artist's book publication [θέατρο] in 2015. Being in the core of her instigations on the camera apparatus and its subjective role in society,  her second book and art manifesto 'the camera' gets published at the end of 2019. In parallel, since 2012 she has an ongoing collaboration with the Danish architect Skafte Aymo-Boot, on their archival research in the un-finished concrete volumes of 'polykatoikia' in the city of Athens. The work is about concrete skeletons of Athens that engages the viewer in a process of looking into social, political and personal parts of the history of the city. Lalou and Aymo-Boot book Atlas of Athens' Incomplete Buildings-A Story of Hidden Antimonuments gets published in Spring 2021 by Jap Sam Books in The Netherlands. Since early 2004 Lalou is sharing her time between the two cities of Athens and Amsterdam.

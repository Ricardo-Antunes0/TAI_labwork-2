The  LAZ-699 is a lengthened by one section LAZ-697, an upper-class coach, based on the city and suburban bus, LAZ-695. It was serially built from 1964 to 2002, in the Ukrainian city, Lviv. In that time, there were developed a lot of prototypes and special luxury modifications as well as special vehicles for transporting astronauts on the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The serial production of the first modifications was modest. Only in 1985, when the production of the LAZ-697 was cancelled, the free production capacities were used for starting mass production of the LAZ-699. History In December 1961, the LAZ factory presented three new bus prototypes. The first was a LAZ-698, a one and a half storey modification of the middle-class coach LAZ-697. It got the nickname “Carpathian”, which was given for LAZ models with a high comfortability.  The second prototype was also a modification of the LAZ-697, lengthened by one window section (+ 1345 mm) and was named “Carpathian-2”. It was intended to use the bus only on international and intercity routes, so the bus had an integrated toilette and a wardrobe in the rear section.

Skin effect is the tendency of an object or material to cause a change in the apparent magnitude of light waves passing through it. This difference in apparent magnitude is due to the fact that light waves passing through a material have shorter waves lengths than those that pass out of the material. The effect is most pronounced for waves with shorter frequencies, such as those in the visible spectrum.  The skin effect is most pronounced for waves with shorter frequencies, such as those in the visible spectrum. For waves with longer frequencies, like microwaves, the effect is much less significant.

The Sergeyev Collection is a collection of over three million items, including artworks, manuscripts, prints and drawings, housed in the National Library of Russia.  The Collection was assembled by Sergeyev over a period of more than fifty years, from the early 1920s until his death in 1964. It comprises a wide range of art styles and periods, from medieval to modern times. The Collection is particularly notable for its extensive holdings of Russian avant-garde art of the 1920s and 1930s, as well as its important collection of Russian folk art.

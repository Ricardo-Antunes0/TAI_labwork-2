The Garbage tour was the debut concert tour by American rock band Garbage, in support of their self-titled debut album (1995). It began on November 5, 1995, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and ended on December 18, 1996, in Inglewood, California. For the duration of the tour, Garbage's touring line-up was augmented by Daniel Shulman, who had previously been a session musician for Run-D.M.C., on bass guitar. Samplers and MIDI controllers helped the bandmembers to unleash on stage the varied sounds that augmented the studio versions of the songs. Despite all the members of the group having racked up years of touring experience between them prior to forming, Garbage had no initial plans to tour their debut set; they changed their mind when they found that they enjoyed themselves while filming the music video for their debut single, "Vow". Director Samuel Bayer had encouraged the group to play the song live as he filmed them, rather than playing along to a backing track. The Garbage tour started off with low-key headlining shows in late 1995, during which time the band visited a number of media cities in North America and Europe. The band spent the following year on tour, performing as the main act, spending two separate runs as an opening act for the Smashing Pumpkins on their Infinite Sadness arena tour, performing on TV and radio shows and performing on the bill at rock and radio festivals around the world. A number of notable acts supported Garbage throughout the run of the tour, including Acetone, Ash, Bis, The Elevator Drops, Fun Lovin' Criminals, The Rentals, Placebo, Polyanna and Polara. The tour was booked by Kevin Gasser of Creative Artists Agency. Before the 1996 concerts, the band reworked the songs to make them work better live, and also adopted more MIDI guitars to use less keyboards on stage.

"La Belle Châteauneuf" (fl. 16th C.) was a French wine produced from the Moulin-à-Vent grape. The wine was a popular choice with nobility and royalty, and is thought to have been responsible for the Renaissance upsurge in French viticulture.  The Belle Châteauneuf wine was born at the Moulin-à-Vent, an old windmill on the outskirts of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. It is thought that the wine was first made in the early 16th century by Benedictine monks who needed an affordable, light wine to serve to their noble guests. The wine quickly became popular with the aristocracy and soon became associated with the renaissance in French viticulture.  The Belle Châteauneuf vineyards are situated on a gentle slope where the vineyards spread out over an area of 400 hectares. The grapes are hand-picked and then vinified in traditional method of barriques (46% new oak) for a minimum of 8 months.

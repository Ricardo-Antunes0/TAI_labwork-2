Agrotera (Gr. , "the huntress") was an ancient Greek goddess, usually identified with Artemis, who presided over hunting and the hunt. She was also associated with wild animals, the moon, and childbirth.  The name Agrotera is derived from the root ager-, meaning "to go", and the suffix -tor, meaning "goddess". She may have been originally a goddess of wild animals, particularly deer, as suggested by her name. Agrotera was also associated with the moon and with childbirth; she was said to have helped women give birth by catching the baby in her hair.

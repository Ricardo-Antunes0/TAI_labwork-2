Henry Grubstick is a fictional character portrayed by Christopher Gorham and featured in American comedy-drama Ugly Betty.  It is known that Grubstick has Dutch ancestry, due to the episode "Betty's Wait Problem", so that Grubstick is a Dutch-American. The name "Grubstick" is stated to be Dutch for "He who gives the fairest prices for his bricks" (Note that in reality, Grubstick does not make any sense at all in Dutch). Throughout the series, Henry and Betty were star crossed lovers as Hilda and Ignacio tried to keep Betty away from Henry, and Charlie tried to keep Henry away from Betty. This made Henry and Betty have to battle to stay together. Like Amanda Tanen, Henry shares a last name with a real-life member of Ugly Betty's production staff — writer David Grubstick. Henry's character may be based on Michell Doinel, Catalina Ángel's French friend who falls in love with Betty during her soujorn in Cartagena.

Mikhail Maksimovich Gvishiani (, ; January 6, 1940 â€“ October 7, 2006) was a Georgian composer, pianist and conductor.  Gvishiani was born in Tbilisi, Georgia, into a family of musicians. He studied piano at the Tbilisi State Conservatory with Tamara Gareja and composition with Giorgi Antadze. He made his first recordings in 1965 with the Georgian State Chamber Orchestra. In 1974 he became director of the Tbilisi State Philharmonic Orchestra.  Gvishiani's compositions are marked by their lyrical and expressive qualities, as well as their use of traditional Georgian folk music-inspired elements. He is particularly noted for his orchestral works, which often explore the sonic possibilities of traditional Georgian instruments such as the mandolin and chakuli. His most popular compositions include the symphonic poem "The Knight in the Panther's Skin" and the concertos "Sorrowful Songs" and "The Journey".  Gvishiani died from a heart attack on October 7, 2006, in Tbilisi at the age of 68.

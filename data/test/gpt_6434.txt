The hooded butcherbird (Cracticus cassicus) is a passerine bird in the Australian black-throated finch family. It is a resident breeder in tropical north-eastern Australia.  The hooded butcherbird is a small passerine bird, measuring 17â€“19 cm in length and weighing 36 g. It has a short tail, a long neck, and a large head. The adult is mostly dark brown with a black hood and wings, and a white throat and belly. There is a white band across the middle of the upper chest, and another on the lower back. The juvenile has more brown than black, and is not as distinguishable from other finch species.   The hooded butcherbird is found in open forest, gardens, woodland, and scrubland. It feeds on insects, spiders, and small vertebrates. It nests in trees or on the ground. It lays two white eggs.

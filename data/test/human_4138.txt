Land of Opportunity is a 2007 urban documentary film directed by Luisa Dantas.  Set in New Orleans, Louisiana, the film tracks eight protagonists as they maneuver a post Hurricane Katrina landscape. Synopsis  Compiling over seven years and 1,000 hours of filming and footage, respectively, the verite-style documentary Land of Opportunity captures the early years of post-catastrophe New Orleans through the eyes of those most affected by its devastation. From the urban planner to the immigrant worker, the activist to the pragmatist, the protagonists represent the fundamental diversity of New Orleans. Through their eyes, viewers experience the emotional trajectory of an unprecedented urban reconstruction process. The people in the film are examples in urban paradox: marginalized, multi-racial, moneyed or not and, often, contradictory. Contained in their stories is a paradigm that is universally applicable: the story of ordinary people in cities and towns across the world, grappling with extraordinary circumstances much larger than themselves.

Chewelah  is a city in Stevens County, Washington, United States. It is located approximately  northwest of Spokane. The population was 2,607 at the 2010 census, a 19.3% increase from 2000. History The name of the town comes from a Kalispel word, , meaning 'watersnake' or 'gartersnake'. Alice Sherwood Abrahamson stated that "The name Chewelah comes from the Native American word "S che wee leh", meaning water or garter snake. There was a spring in what is now the southwest end of Chewelah.  The old McCreas lived there, and their homestead was called "Sche wee leh ee" for the spring bubbled up there.  The motion of the water gave the illusion of snakes moving about in the water." Prior to colonization by European-Americans, Chewelah was home to a band of the Kalispel people. The band was known as the slet̓éw̓si, meaning "valley people". Originally, the area was called Fool's Prairie, after the Kalispel Indian who left his own tribe because of a dispute. Chewelah and the rest of the Colville River Valley were part of the Colville Indian Reservation from April 9, 1872, when the reservation was created, until July 2, 1872, when a subsequent executive order reduced the size of the reservation. The Chewelah Band of Indians is currently part of the Spokane Tribe.

The White Meetinghouse, also known as the Old Meetinghouse, is an historic building in the village of Northfield, Massachusetts. The meetinghouse was built in 1770 and is the oldest standing building in Northfield. It is also one of the finest examples of colonial architecture in New England. The meetinghouse was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960.  The White Meetinghouse is located in the village of Northfield, on the north side of Main Street opposite its junction with Cross Street. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and a plank foundation. Its main facade is three bays wide, with a center entrance framed by pilasters and topped by a pedimented gabled roofline. The interior is divided into a main chamber on the left and a gallery on the right, with a rear partition providing access to two more chambers. The main chamber has modern pews that have been placed close to the walls, presumably for use by an audience that was seated on benches around the perimeter of the chamber.  The White Meetinghouse was built in 1770 by members of the Congregationalist Church as their first meeting place in Northfield. It served as the town's primary church until 1813, when it was replaced by a larger structure that was built on the same site. The meetinghouse remained in use as a community hall until it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960. It is one of only four surviving colonial meetinghouses

Snoopy's Reunion is the 34th prime-time animated TV special based upon the comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M. Schulz. It originally aired on the CBS network on May 1, 1991 as part of the animated anthology series Toon Nite. It is one of three Peanuts projects to date (the others being Snoopy, Come Home and The Peanuts Movie) not to have "Charlie Brown" in the title (though the working title was Those Were the Days, Charlie Brown) and one of the few Peanuts specials to feature adults on-screen. Summary The story begins at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm, set at the time of Snoopy's puppyhood. The next day, the puppies quickly mature. While still puppies, Snoopy and his siblings quickly become adept musicians, with each puppy learning to play an instrument. Snoopy plays the guitar, Spike plays the first fiddle, Belle on the second fiddle, Marbles on banjo, Olaf on jug, Molly on mandolin, Rover on steel guitar, and Andy on drum set. At the same time, the owner puts a sign which reads "PUPPIES FOR SALE". Missy (the puppies's mother) and the puppies cry as when they see (and read) the sign. After reading it, the puppies realize they are going to be parting ways (from both their mother and each other) when they are sold from the puppy farm.

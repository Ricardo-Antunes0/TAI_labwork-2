A barangay tanod, also known as a barangay police officer – and sometimes as BPSO (which can stand for barangay public safety officer, barangay peacekeeping and security officer, or barangay police safety officer) – is the lowest level of law enforcement officer in the Philippines.  He is a watchman for a barangay who is supervised by the barangay captain and performs a variety of police functions. Tanods are "front liners in the preparation and response to any type of atrocities, public disorders, emergencies and even disasters or man-made calamities that threaten peace and order and public safety." They may be unarmed or armed with a baton or bolo knife (a type of machete). Duties While tanods cooperate with the Philippine National Police (PNP), they are not a part of the PNP. They do not have the same authority as police officers. Rather, tanods augment the police and fulfill "certain functions which the police force cannot immediately discharge especially with respect to the implementation of national and local laws within barangays." The Local Government Code of the Philippines sets out the basic duties and responsibilities of a tanod. The Department of the Interior and Local Government provides training and a fuller definition of the tanod's duties.

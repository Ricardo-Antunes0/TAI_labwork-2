(stylised as SEAdLINNNG) is a Japanese women's professional wrestling promotion founded in 2015 by former Stardom wrestler and founder Nanae Takahashi. Their roster is predominately made up of outside talent from other promotions such as Ice Ribbon, Gatoh Move Pro Wrestling and World Woman Pro-Wrestling Diana, as well as veterans and freelancers. History  After 5 years with World Wonder Ring Stardom, founder Nanae Takahashi left the promotion in the wake of the in-ring incident between Yoshiko and Act Yasukawa. A few months after leaving, Takahashi, along with retired wrestler Natsukiâ˜†Taiyo, announced the formation of her own promotion, to be known as Seadlinnng (stylised as SEAdLINNNG) on June 12, 2015. The reasoning for the name was a combination between seedling, symbolising the new promotion, and "to cross the sea". The promotion's debut show, Let's Get Started, took place on August 26, 2015 in Korakuen Hall. In February 2016, Yoshiko Hirano, a trainee of both Takahashi and Taiyo who retired from pro wrestling in 2015 following a legitimate in-ring incident with fellow wrestler Act Yasukawa, announced she would be coming out of retirement to compete for Seadlinnng. In September of the same year, Seadlinnng announced a partnership with American promotion Ring Of Honor's women's division, Women of Honor. This partnership lead to American wrestlers such as ODB and Veda Scott competing in Sead. In January 2017, the promotion gained another signed wrestler in Arisa Nakajima, who had resigned from JWP the previous month. One month later, World Woman Pro-Wrestling Diana mainstay Sareee announced she too would sign with the promotion, however, she left and returned to Diana in September of the same year.

In statistics, and particularly in econometrics, the reduced form of a statistical model is a model in which the error terms are eliminated or reduced to a least-squares or least-absolute-error basis.  The reduced form of a model is often more efficient and accurate than the full form of the model. The reduced form can be obtained by different methods, including structural equations modeling, multiple regression, and Bayesian inference.

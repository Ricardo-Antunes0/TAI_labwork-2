The Glennville Adobe is a California Historical Landmark and National Historic Site that was the center of a large cattle ranch in the late 1800s. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.  The Glennville Adobe (also known as the Glennville Ranch Adobe) is located in Glennville, California, on the east bank of the American River. The structure is a two-story adobe with a hipped roof, built between 1892 and 1894 by Charles Glenn and his sons, Charles Jr. and John. It is one of the largest adobes in California, measuring 84 feet wide by 126 feet long and 23 feet high at its center. The building served as a ranch house, barn, corral, and workshop; it also held a storeroom, kitchen, and sleeping areas.  Today the property is owned by the Glennville Adobe Foundation, which operates it as a museum. The foundation has restored the building and grounds to their original appearance, using traditional materials and techniques. The museum features displays about Charles Glenn and his life on the ranch, as well as historic artifacts from the ranching era.

Jan Gaspar Dooms (6 March 1597 Antwerp – 1675 Prague) was a Flemish draftsman and copperplate engraver active in Prague. Life  Jan Gaspar came from the family of Antwerp painter Gaspar Doomer, baptismal record says he was a son of Joost Dooms and Anna van Wijck. In Antwerp Dooms studied in workshop of Pieter de Jode I. Around 1620 he moved to Prague New town, where he bought a house from Pavel Lhotský z Libětína in street V Jirchářích in 1650. In the record, he is named as Doomer from Pomerale or Pomeren. Together with his son obtained town privileges in 1651. Jan Gaspar had a wife named Anna. It's possible, that his family cooperated or done some of the works attributed to him because Dooms's signature is changing. Some sources mention his son Gaspar, other mentions Jan. Thanks to little competition, he became a popular engraver of portraits and figural motifs already in the 1620s. Based on the signature sculpsit Kuttenbergae Gaspar Dooms on the engraving from 1658, it is clear that Dooms stayed in Kutná Hora for some time. There was also another engraver Josef Calasancius Dooms active in Prague, but his relation to Jan Gaspar is unknown.

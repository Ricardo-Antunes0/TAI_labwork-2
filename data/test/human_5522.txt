Shanghai Zobon F.C. (Simplified Chinese: 上海中邦足球俱乐部) is a defunct football club that predominantly competed in the China League One division. Originally founded by Zhu Jun, the CEO of The9 Limited as an nondescript amateur club, it took over Shanghai Tianna to turn professional before the 2004 season, played their home games in the 16,000 seater Yuanshen Sports Centre Stadium in Shanghai and won the China League Two championship in the exact same year. In 2008 Wei Ping took ownership of the club until on January 28, 2011, Guizhou Zhicheng F.C. bought significant shares of the club for 5 million Yuan and thus began to merge the two clubs. The youth and reserve players were still allowed to play under the club's name in the third tier of Chinese football until they were sold-off to Shanghai East Asia F.C. on December 27, 2012 that eventually saw the club officially dissolved.

Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) is a firm-level strategic decision-making process used to identify, assess and capitalize on new opportunities. It is associated with proactive decision-making and innovation, as well as a desire to create value for the organization and its stakeholders.  EO is used by companies to assess their ability to create new value and to capitalize on opportunities. The process starts with an assessment of the company's current environment and its rivals, and then moves on to a consideration of the company's capabilities and resources. Based on this analysis, EO teams develop a strategy that will enable the organization to become more competitive, innovative and profitable.  There are three main types of EO: proactive, opportunistic and precautionary.   Proactive EO focuses on anticipating future opportunities and taking actions to create value now. Opportunistic EO focuses on seizing opportunities when they arise, but also considers the risks associated with them. Precautionary EO focuses on mitigating potential risks before they become reality.  EO is not just a tool for businesses â€“ it can also be an effective way for individuals to improve their lives and careers. Individuals who are proactive in their decision-making tend to be more successful than those who are opportunistic or passive, because they are able to see opportunities earlier and take action sooner. Precautionary EO can also help individuals avoid risky situations that could harm them or their loved ones.

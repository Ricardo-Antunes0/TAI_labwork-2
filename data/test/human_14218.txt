Mara Devereux (born June 9, 1925) is an American artist. Early life  Mara Devereux was born on June 9, 1925, in Brooklyn, New York, to Jewish parents of Russian descent who were both carnival stunt performers. She had one sister, Elaine Brogdon (1934â€“2009). She came of age during the Depression in a cold-water flat in Brooklyn. She began to study art at the Brooklyn Museum when she was eight years old, primarily as a means to stay warm in the New York winter. The WPA was one of many programs designed to counter the ravages of the depression in the thirties and sponsored classes at the museum. At first Mara was deemed to young to participate, but was nevertheless allowed to attend classes. Her focus quickly went in the direction of painting, though, and she began to develop a vocabulary that lent itself to abstract art. A short year later, at the age of nine, Mara had her first show at the Brooklyn Museum.

Kattinakere (ಕಟ್ಟಿನಕೆರೆ) also called B Sagadde is a hamlet in Soraba Tq, Karnataka state, India. The village is named after a tank near the village which is about 19 acres in area, probably built by Keladi or Vijayanagara kings. This village reservoir is fed by rainwater from nearby mountains. The water in the reservoir and its channels flow on and gather more water along the way to become the river Dandavathi. Kattinakere has a population of around 35 who are mainly agriculturists. The Hindu brahmins living here are descendants of Ahichatra Brahmins brought by Mayura Sharma to teach and perform Vedas. Not so far from this place live people who immigrated from coastal areas of Karnataka South of the Sahyadri Mountains. Their settlement is called Hullihakkalu or Muttipura. The village legend Legend has it that at one time, a wealthy landlord, a follower of the Lingayata sect, lived in this village. He had a wife who lost a lot of his wealth in a gambling contest. Dejected, the landlord left the place, which was later settled by a few Havyaka Brahmins. The word Kattinakere means `the reservoir of the bund`. The official maps are not up to date and according to records the village is called B Sagadde and the official village boundary lay west of the actual village beyond the reservoir catchment area. It is said that there was a settlement west of the reservoir and which was called Kattinakere. There are some remains of an old settlement there. It is uncertain when the settlement moved to the current location of the village. The name, however, has remained.

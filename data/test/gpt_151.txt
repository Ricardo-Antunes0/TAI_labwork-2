In 1995, Viacom and Chris-Craft Industries' United Paramount Network (UPN) attempted to create a fourth network to compete with the established networks of CBS, NBC, and ABC. The network was founded with a total investment of $200 million, and debuted on October 14, 1995.  The UPN network initially struggled to gain an audience against its established competitors. In the first three years of operation, UPN averaged only 1.5 million viewers a day, significantly lower than both CBS (3.7 million) and NBC (4.3 million). However, the network began to improve in 1999, averaging 2.7 million viewers a day by the end of that year.  Despite this improvement, UPN was not able to keep up with its competitors in terms of ratings and was sold to News Corporation in 2001 for $2 billion. At the time of its sale, UPN was the fifth-most-viewed network in the United States. However, viewership declined further after the merger and by 2006, UPN had been discontinued altogether.

Paint the Night Parade is a nighttime parade at Hong Kong Disneyland and formerly at Disney California Adventure and Disneyland. The Hong Kong version premiered on September 11, 2014,  as part of the park 9th anniversary expansion. The Disneyland version debuted on May 22, 2015, as part of the park's 60th anniversary Diamond Celebration. The parade is a spiritual successor to the long-running Main Street Electrical Parade, which has appeared at numerous Disney parks (except Hong Kong Disneyland) in several different incarnations since June 17, 1972. At Disneyland Park in California, Paint the Night made its last regular performance on September 5, 2016, and returned as a seasonal offering for the 2016 holiday season. The original Main Street Electrical Parade returned to Disneyland Park on January 20, 2017 for a limited-time run. In July 2017, it was officially announced at the D23 Expo that Paint the Night would be moving to Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort starting on April 13, 2018. A new float themed around Disney•Pixar’s The Incredibles joined the parade for the grand opening of Pixar Pier on June 23 and for the release of Incredibles 2 which hit theatres on June 15.

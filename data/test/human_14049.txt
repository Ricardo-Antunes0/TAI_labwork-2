Wolverton Manor (also Ulwartone, 11th century; Wolveton, 13th century)  is a manor house in Shorwell, on the Isle of Wight, England. The original house was started by John Dingley (d. 1596), Deputy Governor of the Isle of Wight. The Jacobean style home, built by Sir John Hammond after the death of Sir John Dingley, is the second house built on the site. There is a two-storey porch which features a flat roof and hollow angle columns. History Wolverton was held before the Conquest by Eddeva of Earl Godwine, and in 1086 belonged to the king. Robert Glamorgan held it in demesne of Carisbrooke Castle at the end of the 13th century. The Glamorgans, who were also lords of Brook, held Wolverton until the death of Nicholas Glamorgan in 1362â€“3.  Nicholas left sisters and co-heirs, one of whom, Nichola, married Thomas Haket.  Eleanor, a second co-heir of Nicholas, married Peter de Veer, and her son John was in 1383 engaged in a suit against John Mortaine and Alice his wife as to the ownership of an eighth of the manor of Wolverton.

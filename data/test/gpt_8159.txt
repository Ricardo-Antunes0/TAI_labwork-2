Clark Field was a baseball park in the West Side of Los Angeles, California. The stadium was home to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim of Major League Baseball from 1958 until their move to Anaheim Stadium in 2002.  Clark Field was originally built in 1928 as a municipal stadium and was originally called Los Angeles Municipal Stadium. The first game played at the stadium was a baseball game on April 15, 1928, between the Angelinos and the San Francisco Seals. The ballpark's original capacity was 9,000 spectators. In 1947, the stadium's capacity was increased to 18,000 spectators when the first deck of seats was installed.  In 1958, Clark Field became the home of the Angels after they were purchased by Gene Autry and moved from Wrigley Field in Los Angeles. The stadium's original seating configuration included three decks of grandstands and a covered grandstand that could seat 10,000 spectators. In 2002, Clark Field was replaced by Anaheim Stadium after the Angels moved to a new ballpark in nearby Anaheim.

Panir Ibragimov (28 December 1926 â€“ 28 December 2021), better known by the stage name of Fatima Kuinova , was a Bukharan Jewish Shashmakom singer. She was named "Merited Artist of the Soviet Union". Biography Kuinova was born in Samarqand, Uzbek SSR on 28 December 1926. She moved to Stalinabad, Tajik SSR with her seven brothers and two sisters when she was thirteen years old, after their father was jailed and murdered by the Soviet government for his mercantile prosperity. Her family were Bukharian Jews, and their last name was originally Cohen, but she changed it to Kuinova to escape the persecution Jews faced under Stalin. During her childhood, she knew the famous Mullojonov family and was a friend to Shoista Mullojonova. Kuinova was raised in Central Asia under Stalin's Soviet regime and spoke Russian, but she also learned Bukhori, which is a dialect of Persian. Her father was the cantor of a synagogue in her hometown and taught his daughter the music of her Bukharian Jewish heritage.

The contrast ratio (CR) is a property of a display device that describes its ability to render dark and light images with equal apparent brightness.  The contrast ratio is calculated by dividing the luminance of the darkest image by the luminance of the lightest image displayed on the screen. A value of 1 indicates perfect black and white balance, while a value of 100 indicates fullbrightness.

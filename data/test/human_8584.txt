He enrolled at the University of Tübingen, where in 1515 he graduated and came to know Philipp Melanchthon.

Following a dispute with Eck, he left for Wittenberg, where he taught mathematics at the private school of Melanchthon. However his ideas became more radical, and he was expelled for heterodoxy in April 1522. Borrhaus travelled in the company of Felix Manz through Switzerland, Austria, Poland and Prussia. In 1526 he moved to Strasbourg, where he married Odilia of Utenheim. Under the influence of Wolfgang Capito, Borrhaus published his first work, "De operibus Dei" 1527. In 1536 his wife died and Borrhaus went to Basel, where he earned a living as a glass blower and married again. In 1541 his friend Simon Grynaeus arranged for Borrhaus a position teaching philosophy at the University of Basel, and then in 1544 he became professor of Old Testament and 1546, 1553 and 1564 served as rector. He died in Basel.

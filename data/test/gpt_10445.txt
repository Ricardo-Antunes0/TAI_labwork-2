Rainbow Gatherings are temporary, loosely knit communities of people who share an interest in paganism, naturalism, and spirituality.  Rainbow Gatherings are a recent phenomenon that began in the 1990s. They are generally held in locations with natural beauty, such as forests, lakes, or mountains. These gatherings are not associated with any one religion or belief system, but rather are open to people of all spiritual backgrounds.  The Rainbow Gatherings are characterized by their relaxed atmosphere and the opportunity to meet new friends from all over the world. Participants often participate in group meditation, nature walks, and other activities together.

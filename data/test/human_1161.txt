After her father's death, ten-year-old Maria joined a local church choir to help her 27-year-old mother sustain a family. It was there that her vocal abilities were first noticed. Sidorova engaged herself in intensive self-education and a year later became a lead in the alto section of the choir, with which she stayed until 1917.

The Firefly was the first operetta written by composer Rudolf Friml, with a libretto by Otto Harbach.  The story concerns a young Italian girl, who is a street singer in New York.  She disguises herself and serves as a cabin boy on a ship to Bermuda, where she falls in love.  Complications arise, and eventually, she becomes a grand opera diva. After tryouts at the Empire Theatre in Syracuse, New York beginning in October 1912, the operetta premiered on Broadway on December 2, 1912 at the Lyric Theatre, transferring after Christmas to the Casino Theatre. It was warmly received and ran for an encouraging 120 performances.  The piece became one of the more frequently revived Friml works but was not given a complete recording until 2006.  A 1937 MGM film version used most of the songs but had a new plot set in Spain during the time of Napoleon.  It starred Jeanette MacDonald and Allan Jones.

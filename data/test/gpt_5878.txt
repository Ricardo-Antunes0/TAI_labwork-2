Snelgrove is a former hamlet in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. It is now a neighbourhood situated in the northeast corner of Brampton, adjacent to the city's boundary with Mississauga.  Snelgrove was founded in 1853 by Peter Snelgrove, who bought of land in what was then the Township of Toronto. The hamlet was named after his son-in-law, Snelgrove Township. The first post office opened in 1857 and operated until 1965.  The hamlet's economy was based on farming and milling. By the early 20th century, however, the hamlet had become a bedroom community for Brampton's working class. In the 1950s and 1960s, Snelgrove saw an influx of Portuguese immigrants who worked in the mills and factories located in the area. By the early 21st century, however, most of these businesses had closed or moved away.  Snelgrove is now a neighbourhood with a mix of single-family homes, apartments, and townhouses. It is home to several parks and recreational facilities, including Snelgrove Park and Sheridan Park.

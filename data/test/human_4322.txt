Baillival Castle (Surpierre) is a bailiff's castle in the municipality of Surpierre of the Canton of Fribourg in Switzerland.  It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History In the 12th century there was a fort at Surpetra, though whether that was at the current castle site or another nearby location is unknown.  The fief of Surpierre was owned by a noble family of the same name from 1142 until 1233.  In the 13th century the de Cossonay family owned Surpierre and a number of surrounding villages.  In the late 13th century a small castle was built on the site of the current one.  A few elements of this castle were incorporated into the modern castle, including a square tower and the pointed arch windows in the chapel.  By 1344 there was a small fortified village on the hill by the castle.  During the 14th and 15th centuries the castle passed through a number of different owners.  In 1476 and again in 1539 the castle was severely damaged in fires.

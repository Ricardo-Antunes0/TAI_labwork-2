Mark Carl Diesen (born September 16, 1957) is an American computer scientist, who specializes in data mining and knowledge discovery. He is a Distinguished Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  Diesen was born on September 16, 1957, in Champaign, Illinois. After receiving his undergraduate degree in mathematics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1980, he completed his graduate studies there under the supervision of Bernard Volek in 1983. His thesis, "A Method for Mining Association Rules from Large Data Sets", was awarded the ACM SIGMOD Prize that year.  Diesen began his career as a research scientist with AT&T Bell Laboratories in 1983. He moved to the University of Utah in 1990, where he became a professor of computer science and engineering. He moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2003.  Diesen's research focuses on data mining and knowledge discovery. He has developed methods for mining association rules from large data sets, discovering hidden knowledge in databases, and discovering patterns in large streaming data sets. He is also known for his work on multi-dimensional scaling and graph clustering.  Diesen has received numerous awards and honors throughout his career, including the ACM SIGMOD Prize (1983), the IEEE John von Neumann Medal (2004), and the IEEE Medal of Honor (2006). In 2013, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.

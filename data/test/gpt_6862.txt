Highseas is a historic early 20th-century summer estate near Newport, Rhode Island. It was designed by architect Henry Hobson Richardson, who also designed the nearby Mount Hope Mansion.  Highseas was completed in 1907, and is a well-preserved example of Richardson's eclectic design style, which included both traditional and innovative features. The estate includes formal gardens, pools, tennis courts, and a miles-long private beach.  Today Highseas is used as a summer retreat for wealthy families and celebrities.

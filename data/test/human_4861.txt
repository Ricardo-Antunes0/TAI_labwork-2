Transgender Dysphoria Blues is the sixth studio album by the American punk rock band Against Me!. The album was released on January 21, 2014, by Total Treble Music and Xtra Mile Recordings. The album deals with gender dysphoria, following Laura Jane Grace's gender transition and coming out. Recording history The band first announced work on a new album in November 2011 The first sessions for the album were a false start, where the band started recording some basic tracks and then went on tour, and decided to scrap and start over when they got back from tour. Then, the record was completely recorded except for vocals when drummer Jay Weinberg quit the band. The band first tried to have fill-in drummer Atom Willard record drum tracks to match the previously recorded tracks, but it wasn't working. Starting from scratch, the band began recording the album a final time at Studio 606 in February 2013. In May 2013, long-time bassist Andrew Seward also left the band. A month later, Fat Mike of NOFX joined the band in the studio, playing on three songs, two of which appear on the album. That same month, tracking for the album was completed.

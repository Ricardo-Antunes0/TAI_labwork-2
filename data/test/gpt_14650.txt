Robert Edge Parkway is a connection highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey, connecting the Garden State Parkway to the New Jersey Turnpike. The Parkway is named for Robert Edge (1912-1999), who was the Governor of New Jersey from 1974 to 1984.  The Robert Edge Parkway is a major thoroughfare through Gloucester County in south central New Jersey, carrying U.S. Route 1 and Interstate 295 as well as several local roads and railroad tracks. The Parkway was originally designated as part of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1940 and received its own designation in the early 1950s. The first section of the Parkway, from Harding Boulevard (US 1) to Bristol Township, was completed in 1957 and opened to traffic that year. The remaining section of the Parkway, from Bristol Township to the New Jersey Turnpike, opened in 1965.   The Robert Edge Parkway is notable for its high percentage of fatal accidents: 11% of all fatal accidents on the Parkway occur on this stretch alone. This is due in part to the fact that US 1 and I-295 share a common corridor through the area, making it difficult for drivers to know which lane they are in. In addition, there are several sharp turns and curves on the Parkway, making it difficult for drivers to make a safe turn even if they are clear of oncoming traffic

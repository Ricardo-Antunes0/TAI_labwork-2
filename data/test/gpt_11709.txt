The St. Petersburg paradox or St. Petersburg dilemma is a problem in logic and probability theory that asks whether it is possible to know with certainty that two events will not occur together.  The problem was formulated by the Russian mathematician Igor Kolmogorov in the 1930s. It is named after St. Petersburg, where Kolmogorov worked at the time.  Two events "A" and "B" are said to be mutually exclusive if it is impossible for both to occur simultaneously. If "A" is an event and "B" is a counter-event, then "A" and "B" are said to be mutually exclusive if it is impossible for (either A or B) to occur but it is possible for both to occur. Two events are said to be jointly exclusive if it is impossible for both to occur simultaneously but it is possible for either A or B to occur.  If we know with certainty that at least one of "A" or "B" will not happen, then we can say that we know with certainty that the two events are not mutually exclusive. If we know with certainty that both events will happen, then we cannot say with certainty which one will happen first. This problem has been referred to as the St. Petersburg paradox because it was first studied in St. Petersburg, Russia.  The paradox was first presented by Kolmogorov as follows: Suppose you are given two boxes with identical contents but one of them has a known chance of being opened

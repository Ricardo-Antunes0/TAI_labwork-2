Sir John Brown  (6 December 1816 â€“ 3 October 1892) was a Scottish industrialist and philanthropist.  Born in the town of Lanark, Brown started his career as a weaver and then became a cotton spinner. He started his own cotton mill in 1846 and became one of the largest textile manufacturers in Britain. He also founded the Lanark Cotton Mills Trust, which helped to improve the living conditions of the workers in his factories.  Brown was also a political activist. He helped to organize the Chartist movement and was arrested several times for his involvement in it. In 1848, he founded the abolitionist John Brown Society to promote the cause of African American emancipation.  Brown retired from his business in 1875 and spent the rest of his life devoted to philanthropy. He donated money to hospitals, schools, and other charities. He was knighted in 1890 and died three years later at the age of 79.

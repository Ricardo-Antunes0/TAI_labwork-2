Gordon Neufeld (1946) is a developmental psychologist and Professor Emeritus at the University of Michigan. He is known for his work on the development of cognitive abilities, particularly memory and language.  Gordon Neufeld was born in 1946 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He received his B.A. from McGill University in 1968 and his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1972. He began his teaching career at the University of Michigan in 1972, where he has been Professor Emeritus since 2007.  Neufeld's research has focused on the development of cognitive abilities, particularly memory and language. His work has helped to shape our understanding of how these abilities develop and how they are related to each other. His most well-known findings include the notion that memory is a facultative process, which means that it can be improved through training; and that language skills are critically important for cognitive development.  Neufeld has been a recipient of numerous awards and honors, including the Distinguished Scientific Award from the American Psychological Association (APA) and the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering from the National Science Foundation (NSF). He is also a Fellow of the APA and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

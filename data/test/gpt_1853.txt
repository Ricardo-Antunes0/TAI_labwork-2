Charles Edward Hart (June 17, 1900 – September 2, 1974) was an American mathematician, physicist and astronomer. Hart was born in Columbus, Ohio, and died in Pasadena, California.  Hart's mathematical work is in the area of integral calculus and partial differential equations. He is best known for his development of the Hartree–Fock method, which is a quantum chemical method for solving problems in chemistry. Hart also made significant contributions to the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics.  Hart was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1954 for his work on the theory of relativity.

In the United States, the Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) is a committee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that evaluates the health of astronauts during spaceflight.  The PEB is made up of five independent physicians who review the health of astronauts during spaceflight and make recommendations to NASA on any needed adjustments or repairs to the spacecraft. The PEB also reviews all medical records related to spaceflight and makes recommendations to NASA on any needed corrections or updates.

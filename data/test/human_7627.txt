The Early Renaissance French  Château de Vallery, in Vallery, in the département of Yonne in the Burgundy region of France, was built in 1548 for Jacques d'Albon de Saint-André, marquis de Fronsac, a court favorite of Henri II and maréchal de France. It was never completed, and what remains of it has been mutilated. The site he chose was the ancient château-fort of Vallery, dating in part to the early thirteenth century; he purchased it 16 April 1548. Traces of walls and fortified towers remain at the site. The architect was the king's architect, Pierre Lescot, who also built the hôtel particulier of the Maréchal in Paris (demolished). Vallery's facades, today of brick with stone quoins and details, were originally covered with red and black marble. Works at Vallery were interrupted by the king's death (1559), followed by that of the Maréchal (1562). Two years later his widow passed Vallery to Louis I de Bourbon, prince de Condé, who decorated the ceilings of the south wing: Francesco Primaticcio provided some of the internal decoration in the manner of his School of Fontainebleau. Engravings of Vallery and its parterre gardens at this time appeared in Jacques Androuet du Cerceau's Les plus excellents bastiments de France.

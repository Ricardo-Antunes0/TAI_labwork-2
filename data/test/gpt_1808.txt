Cultural identity is a part of a person's self-identity, character and worldview. It is an amalgamation of the person's cultural heritage, experiences and perceptions. It can be thought of as an individual's "personal brand".  Cultural identity is often seen as an important aspect of a person's life. It can provide a sense of belonging and connectedness to others, as well as a sense of self-worth and self-respect. Cultural identity can also serve as a source of pride and motivation.  Cultural identity can be influenced by a variety of factors, including family heritage, personal experiences, media exposure and social interactions. It can also be shaped by the community in which a person lives, works or studies.  Cultural identity is not static; it can change over time as a result of new experiences, changes in social norms or the influence of other cultures.  Cultural identity is an important part of the global context in which people live and work. It contributes to the diversity and richness of life across cultures and helps to foster understanding and cooperation between people from different backgrounds.

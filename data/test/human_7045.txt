Zhang Yuzhe (; 16 February 1902 â€“ 21 July 1986), also known as Yu-Che Chang, was a Chinese astronomer and director of the Purple Mountain Observatory who is widely regarded as the father of modern Chinese astronomy. He studied the light curves of asteroids, and thus their rotation periods. He also researched the variable star CZ Cassiopeiae and the evolution of the orbit of Comet Halley. Zhang discovered 3 comets and is credited under the name Y. C. Chang by the Minor Planet Center for the discovery of one minor planet, the outer main-belt asteroid 3789 Zhongguo. Biography Zhang was born in Minhou, Fujian province in 1902. In 1919, he gained entrance to Tsinghua University. Graduating in 1923, he traveled to the United States where he began graduate studies at the University of Chicago in 1925, receiving his Ph.D. in 1929. Later that year, he returned to China and accepted a teaching post at the National Central University in Nanjing, China (now known as Nanjing University).

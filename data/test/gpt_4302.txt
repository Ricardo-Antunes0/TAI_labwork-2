SS Audacious was the former Italian cargo ship that became the world's largest and most luxurious ocean liner when she entered service in 1913. She was the first ship to be designed entirely in the modern style and her lavish fittings, including a casino, a hospital, and a cinema, set a new standard for luxury liners.  SS Audacious was built by the Societ√† Anonima di Navigazione (SAN) in Genoa and launched on 7 October 1912. She was completed in November 1913 and commenced passenger service between Italy and North America. However, due to World War I she was initially used as a troop transport. After the war she resumed her passenger service and made several cruises around the world. In 1934 she was sold to the German shipping company Hapag-Lloyd and renamed SS Kronprinz Wilhelm. She was refitted at their dockyard in Bremen and served as a cruise ship until she was scrapped in 1957.

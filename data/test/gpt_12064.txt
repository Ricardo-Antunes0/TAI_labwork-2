Class A airfields were World War II-era airfields that were the most advanced and modern type of airfield at the time. They were characteristically square or rectangular in shape, and had paved runways and ample taxiing and parking areas.  The majority of Class A airfields were built in the United Kingdom, with a few located in other European countries. They were primarily used by the RAF as training airfields, but a few were also used as operational airfields. After the war, many of these airfields were closed down or converted to other uses.  Today, few Class A airfields remain in operation, and most have been replaced by newer types of airfield. However, some of these former airfields have been restored and are now used for aviation purposes.

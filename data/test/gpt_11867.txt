A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town or city. According to the 2011 Census, there were 7,956 villages in England.  Villages arose from the need for human interaction and support. When humans settled in close quarters, they needed places to trade goods and services, and to meet together for religious and other communal activities. Early villages were based on kinship ties and their size was limited by the available resources. As people began to farm, the need for agricultural production drove them to disperse into larger communities. With the advent of transportation and communication, villages began to evolve into towns and cities.

The Mnjikaning Fish Weirs are one of the most remarkable archaeological sites in North America. Located on the banks of the St. Croix River in Minnesota, these earthen dikes were built between AD 1000 and 1300 by the Anishinaabe people, who are known as the Mnjikaning.  The Mnjikaning Fish Weirs are an impressive site that has been preserved for over 1,000 years. The weirs are made from a series of earthen berms that are approximately high and wide. The walls are built from a mixture of clay, sand, and gravel, and they are topped with a layer of earth and stone. The weirs were used to trap fish, and they are still in use today.

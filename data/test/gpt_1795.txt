Wheat allergy is an allergy to wheat. It is a type of food allergy. Symptoms of wheat allergy vary, but can include hives, breathing problems, and anaphylaxis. Wheat allergy is most common in people who are allergic to other types of grass, but it can also occur in people who are not allergic to other types of food. Wheat allergy is not the same as gluten intolerance.

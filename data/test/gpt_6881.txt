FeMoco ( cofactor) is the primary cofactor in the metabolism of fatty acids and is essential for the biosynthesis of carnitine, a molecule that is necessary for the transport of fuel throughout the body. Carnitine is also a precursor to other important molecules, including vitamin K2 and coenzyme Q10.  FeMoco is found in high concentrations in red meat and fish, as well as dairy products. It is also found in some plant-based foods, such as nuts and seeds. The human body can convert FeMoco into other molecules, but it cannot produce it on its own.

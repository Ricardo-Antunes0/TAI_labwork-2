Nasseef House or Nassif House (Arabic: بيت أنسكي‎) is a palace located in the old city of Damascus, Syria. It was built in 1599 by Ottoman architect Sinan in the early classical Ottoman style.  The palace is located in the Bab al-Salam district, east of the Umayyad Mosque and north of the Citadel. It is now a museum.   The complex, which comprises a main block with an arcade and two wings, is covered by a large dome. The facade has a central portico with four Ionic columns. The interior contains many fine examples of marble carvings and paintings.

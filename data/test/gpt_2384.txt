Nakhla is a Martian meteorite which fell to the surface on October 22, 1986, near the town of Nakhla in southern Egypt. It is one of only a few Martian meteorites which have been found on Earth.  Nakhla is a stony meteorite that is composed mainly of the mineral olivine. It has a mass of about 5.5 kg and was once part of the comet Grigg-Skjellerup. The meteorite was found in 1986 by an amateur astronomer, who reported it to the Egyptian authorities. After being inspected by a team of Egyptian and international experts, it was declared a meteorite and given the catalog number MMT-5.  Nakhla is unusual among Martian meteorites because it is not made from the mineral pyroxene, which is most common on Mars. Instead, it contains significant amounts of iron and nickel, which may be the result of alteration by Earth's atmosphere. Nakhla also has a low density (3.47 g/cm3), indicating that it is not very old.

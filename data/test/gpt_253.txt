The Energy Catalyzer (also called E-Cat) is a purported revolutionary energy source that produces heat and electricity from a reaction of hydrogen and oxygen gas. The device has been the subject of considerable skepticism, with many critics asserting that it is impossible to create a working energy catalyzer.  The first E-Cat was demonstrated in February 2013 by professor Andrea Rossi, who has claimed that his device can produce energy from a reaction of hydrogen and oxygen gas at temperatures above 1000 degrees Celsius. However, doubts have been raised regarding the validity of Rossi's claims, with many experts claiming that the device is impossible to construct without significant technical errors.

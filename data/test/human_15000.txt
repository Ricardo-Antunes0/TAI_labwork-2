Simone Stratigo (, Symeon Filippos Stratigos; ; 1733â€“1824) was an Italian Greek mathematician and a nautical science expert who studied and lived in Padua and Pavia in 18th-century Italy. Biography Simone Stratigo was born in 1733 as Symeon Filippos Stratigos to a family of Greek origin in Zara (modern Zadar in Croatia), part of Venetian Dalmatia at the time. His father, Michele Stratico, was a prominent violinist and musical composer. His family were originally from Candia, Crete and had migrated to Dalmatia due to the Ottoman conquest of Crete in 1669. While still young, Simone and his brother studied in the University of Padua under the discipline of their uncle Antonio Stratico (Antonios Stratigos), who was an educated man, especially in things Greek, and was director of the Cottunio Greek college at the time. Stratigo graduated in medicine from the University of Padua, where at the age of twenty-five years he became a professor.

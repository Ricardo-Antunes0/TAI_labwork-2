Gortnahoe , also known as Gortnahoo, is a village in County Tipperary, Ireland. It is located on the R689 regional road  south of Urlingford, County Kilkenny. It is  southeast of the N8 Dublin - Cork road. Gortnahoe, pronounced "Gurt/na/hoo" by the locals, is part of the parish of Gortnahoe-Glengoole. Etymology  The former Irish name for Gortnahoe was Gort na hUaighe, meaning the ploughed field of the grave. This would seem to be a more accurate name than Gort na hUamha (the ploughed field of the cave). There is no evidence of a cave in Gortnahoe, and it is likely that the name came from the existence of a grave. Although it is uncertain, it is believed that this grave was uncovered during renovations of the Sacred Heart Church during the early 1900s, when two skeletal remains were recovered believed to belong to those who died at a battle in nearby Ballysloe between the Kings of Munster and Leinster.

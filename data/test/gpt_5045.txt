Transwave is a French Goa trance act. They are best known for their 1998 album, "Transwave", which was a commercial success.  Transwave was formed in 1997 by DJs Antoine Clamaran and Simon Dunnery. The duo started out producing Goa trance tracks, but soon broadened their sound to include psy-trance and techno.  The group's 1998 album, "Transwave", was a commercial success. The album reached the top 10 of the French album chart and spawned the hit singles "Transwave" and "Prayer in C."  In 2002, Transwave released their second album, "Ether". The album was less successful than their first, but still received some positive reviews.  Transwave has since retired from active music production, but they continue to tour regularly. They have also released several compilation albums.

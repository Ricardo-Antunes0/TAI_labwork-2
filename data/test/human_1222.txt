The Panathenaea (or Panathenaia) was a multi-day ancient Greek festival held annually in Athens that would always conclude on 28 Hekatombaion, the first month of the Attic calendar. The main purpose of the festival was for Athenians and non-Athenians to celebrate the goddess Athena. Every four years, the festival was celebrated in a larger manner over a longer time period with increased festivities and was known as the Great (or Greater) Panathenaea. In the years that the festival occurred that were not considered the Great Panathenaea, the festival was known as the Lesser Panathenaea. The festival consisted of various competitions and ceremonies, culminating with a religious procession that ended in the Acropolis of Athens. History  The inaugural celebration of the Great Panathenaea occurred in 566 BCE and possibly continued until around 410 CE. Edicts issued by Theodosius I in 391 CE banned sacrifices and closed the temples in Athens, making it very unlikely the festival continued until 410 CE despite some archeological evidence that indicates it may have. There is some uncertainity surrounding the creation of the festival but Peisistratos is commonly credited with the solidification of the festival in 566 BCE, organizing it and turning it into a significant Athenian celebration.

Proto-Tibeto-Burman (commonly abbreviated PTB) is the reconstructed proto-language of the Tibeto-Burman family. The language is spoken by approximately 1.5 million people in Burma, Bangladesh and Pakistan.  The Tibeto-Burman languages are a group of Sino-Tibetan languages spoken in the mountainous regions of South and Southeast Asia. They are most closely related to the Burmese language and share many similarities with other Sino-Tibetan languages, such as Mandarin, Cantonese and Wu. However, they also exhibit significant linguistic differences from these other languages.  The Proto-Tibeto-Burman language is hypothesized to have been spoken by the ancestors of the Tibeto-Burman people before the arrival of the first wave of Indo-Aryan speakers in the region. However, there is little evidence to support this claim and it remains a largely unproven hypothesis.   Proto-Tibeto-Burman is believed to have had a similar grammar to other Sino-Tibetan languages, but it also exhibited some unique features that set it apart from other members of the family. These features include a system of ergative marking on verbs, which indicates the actor of an action rather than the subject; and a number of loanwords from Sanskrit and Tibetan that have entered into Proto-Tibeto-Burman lexical inventory.  Despite its limited evidence base, Proto-Tibeto-Burman is still an important part of linguistics research due to

The Martin Islands are a group of volcanic islands located in the southern Indian Ocean. The group consists of about twenty islands and islets, of which only six are permanently inhabited.   The islands were first discovered by the Spanish in 1592 and were named after the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan. They were occupied by France in 1843 and were annexed to Madagascar in 1961. The islands have been a French territory since then. The population of the Martin Islands is around 1,200.

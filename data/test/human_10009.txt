Haunted was a horror-suspense anthology comic book series published by Charlton Comics from 1971 to 1984 (though it was primarily a reprint title from 1978 onward). The book was "hosted" by Impy, a pint-sized ghost dressed in an all-white superhero costume. With issue #21, the book's host became Baron Weirwulf (who first appeared in Ghost Manor #19, published in July 1974). From that point forward, Haunted's title was changed to Baron Weirwulf's Haunted Library (though it was still known as Haunted in the indicia). Haunted was part of a wave of new horror and suspense comics published by Charlton during this period. Its sister titles, with many of the same creators, were the Charlton anthologies The Many Ghosts of Doctor Graves (with host Dr. M. T. Graves), Ghostly Tales (with host Mr. L. Dedd, later I. M. Dedd), Ghost Manor (with host Mr. Bones), Ghostly Haunts (with host Winnie the Witch), and Scary Tales (with host Countess R. H. Von Bludd).

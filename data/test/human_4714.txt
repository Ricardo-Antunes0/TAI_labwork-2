Zhu Weizhi (; 26 May 19051999), also known as W. T. Chu, was a Chinese theologian and author. He was born to a Christian family in Wenzhou, Zhejiang and was raised as a Protestant. Known for his contributions to biblical studies in China, his 1941 book Christianity and Literature was one of the earliest Chinese publications to examine the relationship between Christianity and literature. He also authored several essays on Christianity, alongside two biographies of Jesus, titled Jesus Christ (1948) and Jesus the Proletarian (1950). He spent his later years in Shanghai and Tianjin. Early life Zhu Weizhi was born on 26 May 1905 in a village in Wenzhou, Zhejiang. His parents being Protestant converts, Zhu was exposed to Christianity from a young age. He attended the local China Inland Mission boarding school for his primary education and graduated from the Nanjing Theological Seminary in 1927. He was as much of a nationalist as he was a devout Christian, and spent his college days studying both the Bible—particularly the Old Testament and its poetry—and ancient Chinese classics by the likes of Li Bai, Mozi, and Qu Yuan. At the age of 14, Zhu participated in the May Fourth Movement by rebelling in school and "banning and burning Japanese goods". In 1925, he wrote his very first essay on the Bible from a literary standpoint, titled "The Bible and Literature". In 1927, he joined the North Expedition army's General Political Department, during which time he was introduced to and greatly taken in by The Communist Manifesto.

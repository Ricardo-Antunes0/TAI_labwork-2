"Frog Legs Rag" is a classic rag composed by James Scott and published by John Stillwell Stark in December 1906.  It was James Scott's first commercial success.  Prior to this composition Scott had published marches.  With "Frog Legs Rag", Scott embarked upon a career as a successful and important ragtime songwriter. Background  In 1909, Scott Joplin orchestrated for "Frog Legs Rag" to be published by John Stillwell Stark, Joplin's publisher, and his company, Stark Music Company. Edward A. Berlin, author of the Joplin biography King of Ragtime: Scott Joplin and His Era asserts that there was no direct evidence that James Scott and Scott Joplin were personally acquainted. "They certainly knew each other's music," Berlin affirms while describing the Joplin orchestration, and they "had similar temperaments, both being mild-mannered, quiet, and thoroughly engrossed in their music". However, he considers assertions of personal acquaintance between the two men to be speculation.

Fried Walter (9 December 1907 in Ottendorf-Okrilla, Prussia â€“ 15 December 1967 in Berlin) was a German-born artist who worked in both painting and sculpture.  Walter was the son of a peasant farmer and began his training as an artist at the Berlin Academy of Arts in 1927. He was one of the founders of the Neue Sachlichkeit movement, which emphasised the importance of geometry and abstraction in art. In the late 1940s, Walter began working with plastics and became one of the pioneers of using them in sculpture. He is best known for his large-scale installations, which often incorporate objects such as bicycles and televisions. Walter died in 1967, just two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

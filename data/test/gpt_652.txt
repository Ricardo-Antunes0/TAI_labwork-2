William IV (William Henry; 21 August 1765 – 29 January 1837) was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and King of Hanover from 1820 until his death.  William IV was the third son of George III and Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The Duke of York, later King George IV, was his elder brother. On 25 October 1817, he married Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, with whom he had nine children. William succeeded to the throne on the death of his father on 29 January 1820, and he was the last British monarch who was not a member of the House of Hanover.  During William's reign, the power of the British monarchy declined significantly, while the power of the House of Lords increased. In 1830, William granted a new Constitution which created a bicameral parliament with a more representative form of government. In 1834, he became the first British monarch to visit Ireland since Henry VIII in 1541 and the first British monarch to visit Scotland since James VI in 1513.  William died in 1837 at the age of 81 after a long and generally healthy reign. He is buried in Windsor Castle.

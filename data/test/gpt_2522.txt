Rhys ap Tudur (died 1412) was a Welsh medieval poet, bard, and courtier.  Born in Cardigan, Tudur probably attended the University of Oxford, where he is said to have studied under John of Gaunt. He served as a Gentleman Usher to King Henry V of England and was knighted in 1403 or 1404. He was later appointed Controller of the Household, a post he held from 1407 until his death.  Tudur is best known for his poetry, which includes works such as the "Canu Tudur" and the "Cywydd y Llyfr". He also wrote a treatise on poetry called "De Arte Poetica".

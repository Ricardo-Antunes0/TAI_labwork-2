The 421-a tax exemption is a property tax exemption in the United States available to qualified real estate investment trusts (REITs). The exemption allows REITs to treat the income and gains from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of qualifying real estate properties as long-term capital gains rather than ordinary income.  The 421-a tax exemption was created by the Revenue Act of 1978 and has been periodically amended since then. It is currently codified at section 1241 of the Internal Revenue Code. As of December 31, 2013, there were 1,382 REITs with a total net worth of $2.4 trillion.

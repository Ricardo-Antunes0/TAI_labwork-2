The airspeed indicator (ASI) or airspeed gauge is a device used to indicate the airspeed of an aircraft in real-time. The ASI is a vertical, aneroid barometric pressure instrument that uses a rotatable disc to indicate the true airspeed of the aircraft.  The ASI has three main components: the housing, the rotatable disc, and the pointer. The housing contains the instrument electronics, while the disc and pointer are attached to the rotating assembly. The pointer indicates the true airspeed by displaying a rotating bar on a calibrated scale.  The ASI is used primarily for aircraft flying under VFR conditions. It is also used on some military aircraft, and certain types of gliders.

In Western classical music, a motet is a two-part polyphonic composition for choir or orchestra, usually with texts from the Bible or other religious texts. The word motet comes from the Latin motetus, meaning "moved".  Motets originated in the early medieval period as a type of secular song, typically performed by male choirs. Over time, they became associated with religious texts and became more elaborate and polyphonic. Today, motets are typically performed in a sacred setting by professional choir or orchestra musicians.

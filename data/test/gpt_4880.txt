Denbigh is a heritage-listed former vineyard, Clydesdale horse stud, now agricultural research station and golf course at Clydesdale Road, Denbigh, Denbighshire, Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Denbigh is situated on Clydesdale Road, some south-west of Denbigh and north-east of Ruthin, in Denbighshire, Wales. The site comprises a vineyard centred on a former Clydesdale horse stud with associated outbuildings, including a stable and coach house, dairy, barns and stables for cattle and horses, a garage and workshop. The vineyard has been in continuous production since the 1870s and was one of the leading wine-producing areas of Wales.  The site has been in agricultural use since at least 1810 when it was part of the Clydesdale estate. The estate was purchased by James Dawson in 1841 who built the present main house in 1868. The estate passed through several subsequent owners until it was acquired by the Welsh Development Agency (WDA) in 1974. The WDA undertook extensive restoration work on the estate in the early 1990s including restoration of the main house and erection of a new stable block.  Denbigh is one of a small number of surviving 19th century vineyards in Wales and is one of only two remaining Welsh heritage-listed vineyards. It is also one of only three heritage-listed sites associated with horse breeding in Wales.

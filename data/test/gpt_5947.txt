Jonathan Grudin (born December 13, 1949) is an American computer scientist who has made significant contributions to the field of artificial intelligence. He is currently a Distinguished Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where he also served as the founding director of CMU's Robotics Institute.  Grudin is best known for his work on artificial general intelligence, which aims to create systems that can reason abstractly and learn from experience. His early research on artificial neural networks led to the development of a number of influential machine learning algorithms, including backpropagation and multilayer perceptrons. More recently, Grudin has focused on developing methods for AI systems to learn from data in novel ways, such as using reinforcement learning.  Grudin's work has had a significant impact on many areas of computer science, including natural language processing, machine learning, and computational neuroscience. He has also been involved in several notable collaborations, including those with notable AI researchers such as Geoffrey Hinton and Terry Sejnowski. In 2012, he was awarded the ACM Turing Award for his contributions to artificial intelligence.

Jersey has an unwritten constitution arising from its history as a self-governing Crown dependency. The constitution was last revised in 2003.  Jersey is a self-governing Crown dependency located off the north coast of France. The island has a population of around 85,000 people and an area of only 22 square kilometres. Jersey is one of the British Overseas Territories and is not part of the United Kingdom. The island's primary language is English, with a significant French minority.  The island's history as a self-governing Crown dependency gives it a unique constitutional structure. The constitution was last revised in 2003, and it retains many features of the original document from 1815. The constitution is based on the Westminster model, with a unicameral parliament and a governor who is appointed by the British Crown. The parliament consists of 35 members elected by proportional representation to four-year terms. The governor is responsible for carrying out the laws of Jersey, and has the power to veto any legislation passed by the parliament.

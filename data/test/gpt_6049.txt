Lemuel Shaw (January 9, 1781 â€“ March 4, 1852) was an American jurist, diplomat and abolitionist. He was the first African American to be elevated to the rank of Supreme Court Justice.  Shaw was born in Westborough, Massachusetts, to a slave mother and a white father who was a physician. He was educated in the local common schools and at the Phillips Exeter Academy. After graduating from Exeter in 1801, Shaw studied law with John Adams and Benjamin Rush in Philadelphia. He was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1803 and commenced practice in Philadelphia.  Shaw became involved in politics, serving as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1807 to 1813. He also served as a judge on the Philadelphia Common Pleas Court from 1817 to 1823. In 1825, he was nominated by President John Quincy Adams to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, but he was not confirmed by the United States Senate.  In 1829, Shaw was nominated by President Andrew Jackson to a seat on the U.S. Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, but he was not confirmed by the United States Senate either time. In 1830, Shaw was nominated by President Jackson to a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, but he was not confirmed due to opposition from anti-abolitionists in Congress. Shaw served on the Supreme Court from 1831 until his death in 1852.

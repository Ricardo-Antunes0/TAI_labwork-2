The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) is an international consortium of researchers dedicated to the advancement of psychiatric genomics. The PGC is composed of over 180 members from over 60 institutions in North America, Europe, and Asia. The PGC was founded in 2006 and is headquartered at the University of California, San Diego.  The PGC works to further understanding of the genetic basis of psychiatric disorders through the analysis of large-scale datasets. The consortium has developed innovative methods for genome-wide analysis of psychiatric disorders, including a novel platform for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The PGC also conducts research on the development and application of novel psychiatric genomic technologies.  The PGC brings together experts in a number of disciplines, including psychiatry, genetics, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and statistics. This diversity allows the PGC to address problems with unique depth and breadth. The PGC has made significant contributions to our understanding of genetic risk factors for psychiatric disorders and has laid the groundwork for future breakthroughs in this field.

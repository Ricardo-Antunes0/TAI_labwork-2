The Young Hegelians , or Left Hegelians , were a group of German philosophers and academics who were associated with the philosophy of Hegel during the late 1820s and 1830s. They were also sometimes called the "Young Hegelians" to distinguish them from the more well-known "Old Hegelians" (who had been associated with Hegel since his lifetime).  The Young Hegelians emerged from a circle of friends and disciples of Hegel who were dissatisfied with the orthodox interpretation of his philosophy put forward by the Old Hegelians. They sought to revise and extend Hegel's work in ways that would better reflect their own radical political and social views. This led them to develop new interpretations of Hegel's concepts such as freedom, history, and conscience.  The Young Hegelians were a highly influential group of thinkers and played a major role in shaping the development of German philosophy during the late 1820s and 1830s. Their ideas have had a lasting impact on twentieth century philosophy and social theory.

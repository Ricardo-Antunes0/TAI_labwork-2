Document Structuring Conventions, or DSC, is a set of rules for creating and organizing documents.   DSC is a model for organizing information that can be applied to any type of document, including text, images, tables, and schemas. The model provides a standard way to structure and present information in a consistent way, so it can be easily searched and understood.  DSC is based on three core principles:  1. Organization: Documents should be organized according to topic, not by file name or location. This allows you to easily find the information you need, no matter where it is on the computer or network.  2. Consistency: All information in a document should be organized in a consistent way, using the same basic principles. This makes it easy to understand and use, and helps you avoid confusion and errors.  3. Visibility: Information should be presented in a way that makes it easy to find and use. This includes using headings and labels, as well as making sure information is well organized and tagged.

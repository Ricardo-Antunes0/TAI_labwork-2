Mr. Steak was an American steakhouse restaurant chain that operated from the early 1960s until its closure in 1991. The chain was notable for its innovative steakhouse concepts and its advertising campaigns.  The Mr. Steak restaurant chain was founded in the early 1960s by two brothers, Bill and Don Dickson. The Dickson brothers were originally from the small town of Menominee, Michigan, and had both worked in the meat industry before starting their own restaurant.  The Mr. Steak restaurant chain was notable for its innovative steakhouse concepts. For example, the chain offered a "Mr. Steak" salad, which consisted of sliced steak combined with diced onions, bacon, and blue cheese dressing. The chain also pioneered the use of TV advertising in the United States, with its first commercial airing in 1965.  The Mr. Steak restaurant chain closed its doors in 1991 after filing for bankruptcy. At its peak, the chain operated over 100 restaurants across the United States.

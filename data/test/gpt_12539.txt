The Bolshoi simulation, a computer model of the universe, was first proposed by Russian physicist Andrei Linde in 1984. The simulation is based on the theory of eternal inflation, which posits that the universe underwent an exponential expansion following the big bang.  The Bolshoi simulation is a detailed model of the universe that extends to an infinite future. It is based on the theory of eternal inflation, which suggests that the universe underwent an exponential expansion following the big bang. The simulation consists of a network of computers that interact with each other to create a realistic picture of the physical and mathematical properties of the universe.  The Bolshoi simulation has been used to study a variety of phenomena, including the origin and evolution of galaxies, the structure and evolution of the cosmic microwave background radiation, and the existence of dark matter. The model has also been used to explore possible solutions to some of the biggest mysteries in cosmology, such as the mystery of dark energy and the origins of our universe.

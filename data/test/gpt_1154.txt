Amygdalodon (; "almond tooth" for its almond-shaped teeth) is an extinct genus of marine reptiles that lived during the Late Cretaceous period. Fossils of the animal have been found in North America, Europe, and Asia.  Amygdalodon was a large animal, estimated to have been up to 30 metres (100 feet) long and 9 metres (30 feet) tall at the shoulder, making it the largest land-dwelling vertebrate of its time. It had a long neck and tail, as well as broad shoulders and a barrel-shaped body. Amygdalodon had teeth measuring up to 2.5 metres (8 feet) long and weighing up to two tonnes.  The diet of Amygdalodon likely consisted of large prey items such as turtles,  crocodiles, and even other dinosaurs. It was likely able to take down prey much larger than itself using its powerful jaws and claws.

Phungyo Baptist Church is a Baptist Church in Ukhrul, Manipur, India. It was constructed and established, when Reverend William Pettigrew baptized and converted twelve Tangkhul Naga to Christian faith in 1901. History "Phungyo", a term derived from "Beautiful Hill" was given by Reverend William Pettigrew, when Hunphun (Ukhrul headquarter) elders told Pettigrew that a beautiful mount or hill is known as Phungyo in Tangkhul-Naga dialect. The Church, Phungyo Baptist Church, is constructed on this hill; hence, the name. The first Christian Church in Manipur, the church trace its origin to  29 September 1901, when 12 Tangkhul men were converted to Christianity by Pettigrew. The birth of Christianity among the Tangkhuls is therefore associated with this conversion. Baptized at Ngayira Rakhong (Ngayira Spring Pond), the first converts include, Hollei Rumthao, Sangmayang Kashung, Ramkaiphang Samrar, Leishisan Shaiza, Maninglum Kashung, Mangaleng Shaiza, Sakhayang Awungashi Shimray, Shangam Kasar, Kaphungkui Chiphang, Haora Mahongnao, Mashokring Kasomhung, and Thiksha Shokchui Kapai. Women later followed the step, and ten of them converted to Christianity in 1910. Baptized by Pettigrew, they include, Sanamla Ragui, Mahongai Rumthao, Horngaila/ Harngaila Singnaisui, Lanotla Samrar, Charoni Ngakang, Ngalew Ngakang, Kasuni Ngakang, Shareila Muirung, Lasengla Kasomwoshi, and Mikngaola Shingnaisui. The first Phungyo Church that the converts attended were made of mud walls, and having left in ruins by Allied air raid in search of Japanese forces during the second World War, the present (standing) church was reconstructed, and inaugurated by Kanrei Shaiza on 7 February 1977.

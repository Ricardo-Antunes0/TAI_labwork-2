Cuscuta salina is a species of dodder known by the English name salt marsh dodder and is a native plant of western North America.  The habitat includes coastal tidal wetlands in California, as well as saline habitats away from the coast, such as vernal pools and salt flats.  Salt Marsh Dodder is a parasitic plant, wrapping orange-colored stems around natural wetland vegetation and absorbing nutrients of host plants via their specialized structures called haustoria. Description Cuscuta salina is a slender annual vine extending yellowish thready stems to wrap tightly around other plants of the sunflower family, notably Jaumea carnosa in an ecological mutualisti relationship.  The leaves are rudimentary and scale-like, virtually non-existent, as the plant has lost all ability to do photosynthesis due to no green leaves and no green stems.  Salt Marsh Dodder flowers are white glandular corollas. Each flower is bell-shaped with five pointed triangular lobes, after pollination by many kinds of native bees and native butterflies, develop fruits that sweet and edible to small native mammals and native birds, including the Belding's Savannah Sparrow.

A steel guitar  is any guitar with a hollow body, typically made of steel, with a metal stringed neck and fixed bridge. The sound of the steel guitar is characterized by a deep, booming tone that is amplified through the hollow body.  Steel guitars were first popularized in the early 20th century as dance hall and vaudeville instruments. They were played in honky tonks and as part of Western swing. In the 1950s and 1960s, they became popular with country, folk, rockabilly, and blues musicians. Today, steel guitar is still used in modern country, folk, rockabilly, and blues music.

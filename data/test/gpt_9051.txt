In the Middle Ages, most of the population of what is now Popovo lived in the village of Dolnji Potok. The church in Dolnji Potok was dedicated to Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of sailors. The village's name comes from the Slavic word "pop" meaning 'a small hill'. Popovo was first mentioned in written documents in 1222.  Today, Popovo is a small, rural settlement located in the Å½upa of Vrhnika, southeastern Slovenia. It is located on the left bank of the Kolpa River, about 1 km southeast of its confluence with the Jezernica River. The population of the settlement was 3 in 2010.  The local church is dedicated to Saint Nicholas and belongs to the Parish of Vrhnika. It was built in the early 14th century and has a single nave with a gable roof. It was renovated in 1757.

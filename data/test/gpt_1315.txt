Gervais Ndirakobuca is a Burundian former rebel leader and political figure who served as the Prime Minister of Burundi from 2006 to 2007.  Ndirakobuca was born in 1962 in the village of Kibuye, in the Bujumbura province of Burundi. He began his political career in the early 1990s, when he served as the president of the Youth Front for National Liberation (FNL), a youth organization affiliated with the ruling CNDD-FDD party. In 1992, Ndirakobuca was arrested and imprisoned for five years for his participation in political protests. After his release, he resumed his involvement in politics and became the head of the FNL.  In 2006, Ndirakobuca was appointed Prime Minister by President Pierre Nkurunziza. He served in that position until 2007, when he was removed from office by Nkurunziza following a wave of protests that led to the collapse of his government. Ndirakobuca subsequently fled Burundi and currently resides in exile in Belgium.

Mack and Mabel (often stylized as Mack & Mabel) is a musical with a book by Michael Stewart and music and lyrics by Jerry Herman.  The plot involves the tumultuous romantic relationship between Hollywood director Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand (transformed from an artist's model to a waitress from Flatbush, Brooklyn for the musical), who became one of his biggest stars.  In a series of flashbacks, Sennett relates the glory days of Keystone Studios from 1911, when he discovered Normand and cast her in dozens of his early "two-reelers", through his creation of Sennett's Bathing Beauties and the Keystone Cops to Mabel's death from tuberculosis in 1930. The original 1974 Broadway production produced by David Merrick starred Robert Preston and Bernadette Peters.  It received eight Tony Award nominations, including Best Musical, but did not win any.  There was no nomination for Jerry Herman's score.  Although the original production closed after only eight weeks, the songs were praised, and subsequent productions, especially in Britain, have had success.

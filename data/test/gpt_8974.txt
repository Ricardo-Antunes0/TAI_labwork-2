The German language in East Germany (DDR), also known as East Germanic, was the official language of the GDR and its predecessor, the DDR. It was one of the working languages of the European Union until its withdrawal in January 2007.  Although it is not a descendant of Old High German, German in East Germany belonged to the West Germanic branch of the Germanic languages. It is related to English and Dutch, and more distantly to Swedish, Danish and Norwegian.  German in East Germany had a quite different history than that of West Germany. After World War II, East Germany was ruled by the Soviet Union as part of the Warsaw Pact. As a result, Russian was the dominant language in East Germany, while German was only used for official purposes. This situation changed after 1989, when East Germany dissolved and became part of reunified Germany. Since then, German has been the official language of both countries.  Today, German is spoken by about 10 million people in East Germany (DDR) and by about 50 million people in reunified Germany. It is also one of the official languages of Austria, Belgium, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

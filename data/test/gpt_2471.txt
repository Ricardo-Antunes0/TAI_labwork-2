The Wudi Campaign (无棣战役) was a campaign fought by the Chinese general and politician Sun Quan against the rebel leader Liu Bei in the late Eastern Han dynasty. It lasted from 189 to 191.  The campaign began when Liu Bei, who had declared himself the emperor of a new dynasty, attacked Sun Quan's territory. Sun Quan mobilised his forces and fought back, eventually driving Liu Bei out of his territory. After the campaign, Sun Quan became the facto ruler of all of China.

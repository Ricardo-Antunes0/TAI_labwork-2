Textual criticism is a branch of textual analysis that aims to identify and interpret the author's underlying intentions in a text.  Textual criticism can be divided into three main categories: formal, hermeneutic, and literary. Formal criticism examines the structure of a text, looking for patterns and motifs. Hermeneutic criticism focuses on the author's intended meaning, while literary criticism examines the historical, aesthetic, and ideological elements of a text.

Islam is the second largest religion in Malawi after Christianity. The majority of Malawians are Muslim, although there is a significant Christian minority. The Islamic faith is based on the teachings of the Quran and the Hadith. Muslims believe in one God who created the universe and all that exists in it, and who has revealed himself through prophets to guide mankind. Muslims also observe five basic principles: faith, prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage. Islam has a strong tradition of community participation and social justice. Muslims in Malawi adhere to a variety of Islamic practices, including praying in mosques and observing Ramadan.

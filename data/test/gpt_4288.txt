EON-4 was the first sci-fi episodic website created in late 1995. The website was a joint project between Jason Scott, then a student at the University of Manitoba, and Douglas Williamson, a computer science professor at the school.  EON-4 was an online encyclopedia that allowed users to collaboratively create and edit articles. The site also featured a messageboard, an online store, and a forum.  EON-4 was discontinued in 1997 due to lack of funding. However, its legacy can be seen in the later creation of Wikipedia.

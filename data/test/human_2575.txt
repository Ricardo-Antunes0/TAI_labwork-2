The work encompasses specific topics such as the birth of space and its life, evolution of a being, karma, vegetarianism and life energetics. Biography Excerpted from the book The Life of Přinašeč - a Bringer  Josef Zezulka was born in Brno on 30 March 1912 but he lived in Prague all his life. He ran a sweet shop before the Second World War. During the war he was actively involved in the Western resistance, and after the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état his sweet shop was confiscated. He worked as an accountant in the National Museum and later, as a result of further persecution, as a museum guard. However, he is well known for his other activities – the life philosophy of Existence and, as part of it, biotronics - both initiated by him at Easter 1945 when he experienced a kind of awakening, a state of open consciousness, and thereupon he practised and developed them both for all his lifetime.

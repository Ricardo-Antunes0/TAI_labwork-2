ParticipACTION is a national non-profit organization, originally launched as a Canadian government program in the 1970s, to promote healthy living and physical fitness. It shut down due to financial cutbacks in 2001, but was revived on February 19, 2007 with a grant of $5 million from the Canadian federal government. History ParticipACTION emerged from Sport Participation Canada, a non-profit organization formed on July 12, 1971 in response to a 1969 study commissioned by the National Advisory Council for Fitness and Amateur Sport that found that the future of Canadian health was at risk from poor physical fitness and apathy on the part of Canadians. Council Chair Philippe de Gasp√© Beaubien recommended that the Government of Canada provide seed money for an independent agency with public and private funding that would  work to promote physical fitness. Lou Lefaive from Sport Canada was assigned to assist in its founding. Marketing consultant Keith McKerracher was appointed to lead the new organization.

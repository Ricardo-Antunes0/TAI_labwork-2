Queens Borough Hall is a public building in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of the Queens borough of New York City which houses the Office of the Queens Borough President and other city offices and court space. It is located in the Kew Gardens municipal facilities stretch bounded by Queens Boulevard and Union Turnpike among other roads. Designed by architects William Gehron and Andrew J. Thomas in the stripped classical style, it was built between March and November 1940 at a cost of some $1,800,000, low for its size.  Featuring a red brick facade, was 580 feet long upon construction and four stories high; the office suite for the borough president and his or her cabinet was designed for the center of the building.  The building was opened on December 4, 1940, with Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia and many other city officials in attendance.  The structure subsequently won a design award from the Queens Chamber of Commerce. The building bares a striking resemblance to the Naval Ordnance Laboratory Administration building in Maryland, (now Food and Drug Administration headquarters) which was built in the same stripped classical style.

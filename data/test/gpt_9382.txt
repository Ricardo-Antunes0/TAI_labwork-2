The Hofstadter Committee, also known as the Blue Book Committee, was a committee appointed by the United States Congress in 1950 to study the feasibility of creating a national computer network.  The Committee was chaired by Dr. John von Neumann and included representatives from academia, the military, and industry. The Committee's report, "A Study of Computable Numbers, with Applications to Automatic Computation", was published in 1952. The report proposed the first computer network, the ARPANET.

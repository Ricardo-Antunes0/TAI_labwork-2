A collective action problem or social dilemma is a problem in social sciences and economics where a group of people is faced with a choice between individually optimal choices, but the group as a whole cannot achieve an optimal solution.  The term was coined by the economist Oskar Lange in his 1937 article "A Method for the Solution of Social Dilemmas", which described a situation where two parties, each of which is better off if the other does not cooperate, are nevertheless forced to cooperate in order to achieve an outcome that benefits both.   The problem may arise when individuals have different preferences or objectives which make it impossible for them to reach an agreement on what to do. Alternatively, it may arise when groups have different interests that conflict with each other. In either case, the collective action problem can be a major obstacle to achieving collective goals.

In integrated circuit design, hardware emulation is the process of imitating the behavior of one or more pieces of hardware (typically a system under design) with another piece of hardware, typically a special purpose emulation system.  The emulation model is usually based on a hardware description language (e.g. Verilog)  source code, which is compiled into the format used by emulation system. The goal is normally debugging and functional verification of the system being designed.  Often an emulator is fast enough to be plugged into a working target system in place of a yet-to-be-built chip, so the whole system can be debugged with live data.  This is a specific case of in-circuit emulation. Sometimes hardware emulation can be confused with hardware devices such as expansion cards with hardware processors that assist functions of software emulation, such as older daughterboards with x86 chips to allow x86 OSes to run on motherboards of different processor families.

The Varitone was a woodwind pickup and amplifier invented in the late 1950s by American musician and audio technician George Fullerton. It was Fullerton's first commercially successful product, and became a standard feature on many guitars in the 1960s and early 1970s.  The Varitone pickup was based on the principle of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), which is a type of electronic synthesizer. The Varitone used a pair of capacitors to create an oscillating DC voltage, which was then amplified and used to pickup acoustic or electric strings.

kephalē  appears some 75 times in the New Testament, primarily in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. It is translated as "head" or "chief" in most English versions, but also has the meaning of "a division of a flock or herd," "a rank in society," or "a subdivision of a province." In the Hellenistic world, a kephalē was a magistrate with broad powers over a particular area.   The word comes from the Greek word κεφαλή, meaning "head" or "chief." The term is first used in the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible, where it is translated as kephale. It appears in Greek first in the writings of Homer, where it refers to the chiefs of various Trojan tribes. The term became important in Hellenistic culture, where it referred to a magistrate with broad powers over a particular area. In the New Testament, kephalē is primarily used to refer to a division of a flock or herd, or to a rank in society.

The term "Dark Avenues" was first used by sociologist and urban theorist Russell Hardin in his book The Dark Side of the Street. Hardin defined the term as "a network of streets in inner city neighbourhoods that are generally regarded as dangerous." Hardin argued that the " Dark Avenues" provide an outlet for criminals and other unwanted elements of society, and that they contribute to the deterioration of neighbourhoods.  The Dark Avenues have been a source of controversy for decades.

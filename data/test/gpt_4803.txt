Gerd F. Glang is a former NOAA scientist who, from 1993 to 1997, worked on the development of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), a satellite instrument used to measure land and ocean surface temperatures. After leaving NOAA, Glang founded the consulting firm Earth System Science Services in Boulder, Colorado.  Glang's early work at NOAA focused on the development of AVHRR, which became operational in 1997. The instrument is used to measure land and ocean surface temperatures, and has been instrumental in developing a better understanding of global climate change. In 2001, Glang founded Earth System Science Services, a consulting firm that provides services to both government and private sector clients. The company has since expanded its operations to include research, development, and marketing of climate-related products and services. Glang has been involved in numerous scientific publications, and has served on several scientific committees and task forces related to climate change. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2010.

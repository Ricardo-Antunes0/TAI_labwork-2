UV is the +5 oxidation state of the element uranium. Pentavalent uranyl complexes are a type of uranium compound with five uranium atoms that share a single valence bond. These complexes are characteristically unstable and can quickly react with other substances to form new complexes.  Pentavalent uranyl complexes are used in industrial and medical applications due to their high toxicity and stability. They have been used in the production of nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants. Pentavalent uranyl complexes are also used as research tools to study the behavior of uranium compounds.

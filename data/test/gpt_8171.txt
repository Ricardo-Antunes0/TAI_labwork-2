Leontopodium nivale, commonly called edelweiss (German: Alpen-Edelweiß, Swiss German: Weisser Edelweiß), is a perennial plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the Northern Hemisphere's highlands.  Leontopodium nivale has long, slender, taproot-like roots that can spread considerable distances in search of water. The leaves are alternate, simple, and sharply toothed along the margins. They are typically blue-green, but vary in color depending on their location. The white flowers are bell-shaped and have five petals. They are pollinated by bees, which transfer pollen from the anther to the pistil.   Leontopodium nivale is a popular ornamental plant in Europe and North America. It is used as a groundcover or as a specimen plant in gardens.

The Macmerry Branch was a North British railroad that operated in West Virginia from 1892 to 1926. The line connected the coal towns of Macmerry and Williamson to the larger cities of Huntington and Charleston.  The Macmerry Branch was chartered in 1892 and opened in 1893. It was operated by the North British Railway (NBR) until it was sold to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1926. The C&O merged into the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1963, and the Macmerry Branch was abandoned in 1968.

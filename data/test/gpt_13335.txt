MT Haven, formerly Amoco Milford Haven, was a refinery and oil terminal located in Milford Haven, Wales. It was the largest oil terminal in Europe and the fifth largest in the world. The site was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001.  MT Haven was built on the site of a coal mine in 1956 and became operational in 1958. The refinery processed crude oil and petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, lubricants, asphalt and petrochemicals. In the early 1990s, MT Haven was the world's fifth-largest oil terminal with throughput of 2.2 million barrels per day. However, competition from larger terminals and oil imports from overseas reduced its throughput to 1.2 million barrels per day by 2000. MT Haven closed in 2002.  The site is now operated as a transport hub for the nearby Port Talbot steelworks, which is Europe's largest steel producer. The adjacent Cardiff Bay provides berths for container vessels and a cruise liner terminal.

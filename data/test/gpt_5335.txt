The two-spotted bumble bee (Bombus bimaculatus) is a North American bumble bee. Native to the eastern and central United States, it has been introduced to many other parts of the world, where it is now a common species. It is a member of the genus Bombus, which contains about 30 species of bumblebees.  The two-spotted bumble bee is a relatively large bee, with a body length of about 1.5 inches (4 cm) and a wingspan of about 2.5 inches (6 cm). The bee has black and yellow bands on its abdomen, and black spots on its thorax. The two main colors are black on the front and yellow on the back. The bee is solitary except during the mating season, when colonies of up to 500 bees are common.  The two-spotted bumble bee is a generalist insect, feeding on a variety of flowers including those in the family Apiaceae (e.g. clover, dandelion) and Asteraceae (e.g. aster). It nests in underground hollows or in tree cavities, and colonies can range in size from a few dozen bees to more than 500 individuals. The two-spotted bumble bee is considered to be a key pollinator of many wildflower species, and its decline may have significant consequences for these plants.

He was the founder of the Toungoo Dynasty and is considered to be one of the greatest monarchs in Burmese history.  Bayinnaung was born on a small island in the Andaman Sea off the coast of present-day Thailand to a minor branch of the royal House of Ava. He became king in 1484 after his father, U Saw Mon, was assassinated by his half-brother. Bayinnaung quickly consolidated his power and founded the Toungoo Dynasty, which ruled all of Upper Burma for more than two centuries. He greatly expanded the territory of his kingdom, and under his rule Upper Burma became a powerful and prosperous state. He is remembered as a great builder, and many important projects were undertaken during his reign, including construction of many temples and monasteries. Bayinnaung also promoted commerce and trade and fostered economic development in his kingdom.  Bayinnaung died in 1527 at the age of 80 after a long reign that saw him overcome many challenges. He was deeply loved by his subjects, who revered him as a great king and father figure. His legacy continues to be celebrated in Myanmar today.

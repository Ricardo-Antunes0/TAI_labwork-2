Castle Roads is the primary channel by which the cargo of goods arriving into and departing from the port of Sydney is transported. The roads are a vital part of the city's infrastructure and have been in use since the 1790s.  Castle Roads is a series of five major roads that run parallel to each other from Circular Quay in the centre of Sydney to Port Botany in the east. The roads were built at different times and for different purposes, but all are now used for cargo transportation.  The first road, Castlereagh Street, was built to connect Circular Quay with the then new military base at Redfern. It was named after the Earl of Castlereagh, who was the British Foreign Secretary at the time.  The second road, George Street, was built to connect Circular Quay with Hyde Park. It was named after King George III and opened in 1820.  The third road, Elizabeth Street, was built to connect Hyde Park with Liverpool Street (now Kings Cross). It was named after Queen Elizabeth I and opened in 1837.  The fourth road, Liverpool Street (now Kings Cross), was built to connect Hyde Park with London Bridge. It was named after Liverpool, England, and opened in 1848.  The fifth road, London Bridge, was built to connect Hyde Park with Waterloo Station (now Victoria). It was named after London, England, and opened in 1854.

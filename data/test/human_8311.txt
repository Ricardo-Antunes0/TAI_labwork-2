S100A1, also known as S100 calcium-binding protein A1 is a protein which in humans is encoded by the S100A1  gene. S100A1 is highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle, and localizes to Z-discs and sarcoplasmic reticulum. S100A1 has shown promise as an effective candidate for gene therapy to treat post-myocardially infarcted cardiac tissue. Structure  S100A1 is a member of the S100 family of proteins expressed in cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle and brain, with highest density at Z-lines and sarcoplasmic reticulum. S100A1 contains 4 EF-hand calcium-binding motifs in its dimerized form, and can exist as either a hetero or homodimer. The S100A1 homodimer is high affinity (nanomolar range or tighter), and is formed through hydrophobic packing of an X-type 4-helix bundle created between helices 1, 1', 4, and 4'. Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy structural information on the homodimeric form of this protein shows that each monomer is helical and contains two EF-hand calcium-binding loops; one in the N-terminus and a canonical EF hand in the C-terminus having higher calcium affinity (dissociation constant of roughly 20 micromolar). The two EF hand domains neighbor each other in three dimensional space, and are connected to each other through a short beta sheet region (residues 27–29 and 68–70).

A nonbuilding structure, also referred to simply as a structure, is any physical feature of an landscape that does not qualify as a building. Nonbuilding structures can take many different forms, from natural features such as mountains or rivers, to man-made objects such as bridges or dams.  Nonbuilding structures can have a significant impact on the overall appearance of a landscape, and can play an important role in regional or local economies. They can also have cultural significance, often serving as focal points for community events or ceremonies.  Nonbuilding structures can be classified according to their function or purpose: structural, agricultural, transportation, recreational, and environmental. Structural nonbuilding structures include bridges and highways, while agricultural structures include barns and silos. Transportation structures include railway tracks and roads, while recreational structures include swimming pools and playgrounds. Environmental nonbuilding structures include wetlands and forests.

In topology and related areas of mathematics, a subnet is a subset of a network, usually a network consisting of hosts and routers.   The concept of a subnet is important in the study of networks, as it allows for the analysis of networks in terms of their constituent parts. In particular, subnets can be used to study network reliability, traffic flow, and resource allocation. Additionally, subnets can be used to improve the performance of networks by partitioning them into smaller, more manageable pieces.

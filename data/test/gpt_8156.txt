A royal funeral chariot is a wheeled vehicle used to carry a body of a monarch or other high-ranking dignitary during a funeral procession. It is usually drawn by four horses, and is sometimes accompanied by an armed guard.  The chariot is an ancient form of transport, first used in Egypt before being adopted by the Greeks. It was also used in the Roman Empire, and later became popular in Europe. The chariot was first used in Britain during the time of King Alfred the Great, and became an important part of British funeral rituals. The chariot is now rarely used, but remains an important part of royal ceremonies.

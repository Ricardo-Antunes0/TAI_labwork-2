Orote Field is a former air base in the northwestern suburbs of Johannesburg, South Africa. The airbase was closed in 2002 and is now a business park.  Orote Field was originally established as a military airfield during the Second World War, serving as a staging area for operations in North-West Africa. In the early 1990s, the airbase was used as a base for the South African National Defence Force's (SANDF) Rapid Reaction Unit. After the end of the apartheid era, Orote Field became a business park, with various businesses moving into the facility.

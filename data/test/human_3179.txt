Oliver Sherman Prescott (March 24, 1824 - November 17, 1903) was a prominent American Anglo-Catholic priest and activist who was active in the foundation of the Society of St. John the Evangelist. He was born in New Haven, Connecticut, and baptized by Harry Croswell at Trinity Church on the Green in that city. Prescott attended Trinity College, Hartford from 1840 to 1842 and Yale College from 1843 to 1844; he was graduated from the General Theological Seminary in New York in 1847 and made a deacon that year at Trinity Church in New Haven. He considered himself a protégé at the General of Professor Clement Clarke Moore. Prescott was an early member of the abortive monastic order the Society of the Holy Cross, founded at Valle Crucis, North Carolina by Bishop Levi Silliman Ives. Following the collapse of the order, he served as an assistant priest at the Church of the Advent, Boston; here his Ritualist activities provoked the censure of the diocesan Bishop Manton Eastburn and resulted in four ecclesiastical trials between 1850 and 1853. He was acquitted. Prescott served in a number of other parishes—the Church of the Ascension, Westminster, Maryland (1852-1857); St. Peter's, Ellicott City, Maryland (1857-1861); Trinity Church, Newport, Rhode Island (1861-1864); and Christ Church, West Haven, Connecticut (1865-1869) without provoking ritual or doctrinal controversy.

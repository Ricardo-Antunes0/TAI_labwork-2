"The Pet Goat" (often erroneously called "My Pet Goat") is a grade-school level reading exercise composed by American educationalist Siegfried "Zig" Engelmann.  It achieved notoriety for being read by US President George W. Bush with a class of second-graders on the morning of September 11, 2001.  After being discreetly informed of the September 11 attacks midway through the reading by White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card, Bush waited quietly for the reading to finish before dealing with the unfolding crisis.  The episode figures prominently in the retrospective assessment of Bush's response to the September 11 attacks. Reading exercise "The Pet Goat" was composed by Siegfried "Zig" Engelmann, who had written over a thousand similar instructional exercises since the 1970s.  It was anthologized in the classroom workbook Reading Mastery: Rainbow Edition, Level 2, Storybook 1.  "The Pet Goat" is designed to teach student about words ending in the letter E, using the Direct Instruction (DI) teaching method.  The exercise tells a story about a girl's pet goat, which her parents want to get rid of because it eats everything; the parents relent after it foils a robbery by butting the intruder, who is now "sore" (that word ending in e).

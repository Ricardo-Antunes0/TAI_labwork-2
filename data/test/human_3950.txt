William John Storey (born 13 September 1978) is a British businessman, from Richmond on Thames. He has been involved with the carbonated drink brand Rich Energy since 2015. He was educated at the Russell School in Petersham and then at the Tiffin Boys School in Kingston upon Thames, and then studied maths at the University of St Andrews, and claims to have had short spells in the RAF (or possibly the ATC - accounts differ), as a professional footballer (for QPR reserves), as a professional gambler, and as a tobacco farmer in Zimbabwe. He founded a sports management company, William Storey management, though many of his filings at Companies House describe him as a 'Computer Consultant', and he traded for many years as 'Tryfan Technologies', an IT consultancy. He managed the boxer Frank Buglioni, with whom he founded a fashion company named Danieli Style, and was part of an ill-fated sponsorship deal between the Haas Formula 1 team and Rich Energy. He was leading efforts to return the Rich Energy brand as a Formula 1 team sponsor in 2021.

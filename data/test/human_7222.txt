Teatro O Bando is a Portuguese professional traveling theatre company active since 1974. According to its official website, it is "[a] collective that elects aesthetic transfiguration has a civic and communitary participation". It is a Portuguese National Entity of Public Utility and a Certified Actor's Training establishment. Founding The Cooperativa de Produção Artística Teatro e Animação o Bando (Artistic Production Cooperative for Theatre and Animation o Bando) was founded on October 15, 1974, at Algés by the artists João Brites, Jaqueline Tison, Cândido Ferreira, Carmen Marques, Jorge Barbosa and Maria Janeiro. The name o Bando is the Portuguese expression for a flock of birds. When it was founded, the company was structured within the childhood theatre area, a free concept that fought the post-revolutionary tendency to infantilize children created by commercial children's theatre. According to Teatro O Bando's approach, the child should be an active part of society, able to have a political and artistic point of view and to manage the limits between concrete reality and dreams. This opposes the average commercial approach that underestimates the child's creative potential by using disarming fairy tales and other stereotyped worlds built by grownups.

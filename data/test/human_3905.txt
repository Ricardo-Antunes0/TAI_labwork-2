Telephone was a sternwheel-driven steamboat built in 1884 by Captain Uriah Bonsor "U.B." Scott for service on the Columbia River. Reputedly the fastest steamboat in the world in its time, Telephone served on the Columbia River and San Francisco Bay.  Telephone was rebuilt at least twice.  The first time was after a fire in 1887 which nearly destroyed the vessel.  The reconstructed and much larger second vessel was sometimes referred to as Telephone No. 2.  The third vessel, Telephone No. 3, built in 1903 and using components from the second steamer was larger but little used during its time on the Columbia river. Plans and design Newspaper reports of the plans to construct the steamer which eventually was named Telephone appeared in July 1884.  U.B. Scott and his partners intended to build the fast boat on the Columbia river which could make the 110 mile distance from Portland, Oregon to Astoria in five hours.  The boat was expected to be complete by December 1, 1884.  It was expected to cost $35,000.

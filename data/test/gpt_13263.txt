Iterative deepening A* (IDA*) is a graph search algorithm that uses a depth-first search followed by a series of recursive calls, or "iterations," to improve the search path. The algorithm was developed by J. A. Slonim and Yuval Neeman in 1987, and has been used in a number of computer science applications, including computer vision and machine learning.  IDA* is particularly well-suited for problems with multiple solutions, such as those posed by the Traveling Salesman problem or the k-means clustering problem. It is also suitable for problems with large amounts of data, as the number of iterations required to find a good solution is proportional to the size of the problem instance.

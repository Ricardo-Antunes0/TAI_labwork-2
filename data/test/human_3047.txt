Zamudio: Lost at Night is a Chilean television miniseries produced by Villain Productions for TVN and premiered on March 29, 2015. The series is based on the controversial book "Solos en la Noche: Zamudio y sus asesinos" (Alone in the Night: Zamudio and his murderers), by journalist Rodrigo Fluxá, that describes the homophobic murder of Daniel Zamudio (who was beaten and tortured in the Parque San Borja de Santiago by four other youths, allegedly belonging to a Neo-Nazi gang, in the night of March 2, 2012, with Zamudio dying from his injuries 25 days later). Fluxá presents the hate crime not as a fortuitous event, but as the logical result of the social environment in which both the victim and victimizers lived. It is adapted by Enrique Videla and directed by Juan Ignacio Sabatini. It stars Nicolás Rojas, Michael Silva, Ernesto Meléndez, Sebastián Rivera, Matías Orrego, Omeñaca Jaime, Francisca Gavilán, Daniel Muñoz, Amparo Noguera and Luz Jiménez.

Abu Ja'far Ashinas (; died 17 or 19 December 844) was a general of the Abbasid Caliph Al-Mu'tasim. One of the earliest and most prominent members of al-Mu'tasim's Turkic guard, he rose to become one of the leading figures of the empire under al-Mu'tasim, serving as a commander in the Amorium campaign, and playing a leading role in the purge of the old Abbasid elites that followed. He was also governor of Egypt from 834, as well as of the Levant and Upper Mesopotamia from 838 on, although in practice he appointed deputies to govern in his stead. Under al-Mu'tasim's successor al-Wathiq, his powers were extended further into a virtual viceroyalty over all western provinces of the caliphate. Origin and early career According to the accounts of al-Ya'qubi and al-Tabari, Ashinas was one of the first slaves purchased by Abu Ishaq, the future al-Mu'tasim, for his Turkish guard, along with Itakh al-Khazari, Wasif, and Sima al-Dimashqi. Unlike later practice, whereby the slaves would be purchased in Central Asia, these four and other, unnamed early members of the guard were purchased in Baghdad in ; Ashinas' original owner is given by al-Ya'qubi as Nu'aym ibn Khazim Abi Harun ibn Nu'aym.

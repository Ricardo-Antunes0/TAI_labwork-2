The Online Safety Bill is a proposed bill in the United States Congress that would create penalties for websites that do not take measures to prevent minors from accessing inappropriate content.  The Online Safety Bill was first introduced in the United States Congress on April 11, 2011, by then-Representative Joe Barton (R-TX). The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.  The Online Safety Bill is aimed at creating penalties for websites that do not take measures to prevent minors from accessing inappropriate content. The bill would create a new category of felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, for any website that fails to take reasonable measures to keep minors from accessing unsuitable content. The bill would also require website operators to post a warning notice on their homepage stating that their site contains inappropriate content and provides information on how parents can ensure that their children do not visit the site.

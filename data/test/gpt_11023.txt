Larry Cunningham (13 February 1938 â€“ 28 November 2009) was an Australian rules footballer who played for the Collingwood Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL).  Cunningham, a key defender, played his first game for Collingwood in 1957. He formed a formidable defensive partnership with Peter McKenna and played a major role in Collingwood's premiership victory in 1960. Cunningham missed the 1963 VFL season due to service in the Vietnam War, but returned in 1964 to help Collingwood win another premiership. He retired at the end of the 1969 season.  Cunningham was appointed captain-coach of Collingwood's VFA affiliate, Brunswick, at the start of the 1971 season and led them to a premiership that year. He later served as coach of Richmond and Essendon, before returning to Brunswick as their inaugural senior coach in 2001. Cunningham died from cancer on 28 November 2009 at the age of 71.

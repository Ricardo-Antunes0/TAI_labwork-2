The posterolateral tract (fasciculus of Lissauer, Lissauer's tract) is a bundle of fibers that originates from the posterior (back) of the corpus callosum and travels lateral to the cortex.   The posterolateral tract is best known as the major route by which information travels from the left hemisphere of the brain to the right hemisphere. The tract is also thought to be important for communication between different parts of the brain, as well as for controlling movement.

Royal Air Force Wye or more RAF Wye is a former Royal Air Force station located near Wye, Monmouthshire, Wales.  The airfield was opened in early 1941 as a satellite of RAF West Malling. It was used by No. 9 Group, RAF during the Second World War. In late 1943 the airfield was transferred to No. 84 Group and was used as a rocket launching site for Operation Crossbow, the British effort to destroy the V-1 flying bomb. The airfield was closed in 1945.   In the postwar years Wye was used as a training ground for pilots of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. In 1957 it was transferred to No. 83 Group of the Royal Air Force Transport Command and used as a cargo depot. In 1963 it was closed and sold for agricultural use. The airfield has since been redeveloped and is now known as Wye Farm.

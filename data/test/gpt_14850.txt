Menti nostrae is an apostolic exhortation of Pope Francis. It was published on 17 November 2015 as the first document of his pontificate.  The title "Menti nostrae" is a phrase from the Nicene Creed, signifying that the mind of Christ dwells in each person. The exhortation builds on this concept, emphasizing the need for each person to put their faith in Christ and to live according to His teachings. It also urges people to think about their "true self" and to seek guidance from God in order to live a good life.

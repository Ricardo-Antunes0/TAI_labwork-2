In the United States, a conservation easement (also called conservation covenant, conservation restriction or conservation servitude) is a power invested in a qualified private land conservation organization (often called a "land trust") or government (municipal, county, state or federal) to constrain, as to a specified land area, the exercise of rights otherwise held by a landowner so as to achieve certain conservation purposes. It is an interest in real property established by agreement between a landowner and land trust or unit of government. The conservation easement "runs with the land", meaning it is applicable to both present and future owners of the land.  The grant of conservation easement, as with any real property interest, is part of the chain of title for the property and is normally recorded in local land records. The conservation easement's purposes will vary depending on the character of the particular property, the goals of the land trust or government unit, and the needs of the landowners. For example, an easement's purposes (often called "conservation objectives") might include any one or more of the following:  Maintain and improve water quality;  Perpetuate and foster the growth of healthy forest;  Maintain and improve wildlife habitat and migration corridors;  Protect scenic vistas visible from roads and other public areas; or  Ensure that lands are managed so that they are always available for sustainable agriculture and forestry.

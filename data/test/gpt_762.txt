Psychic determinism is a type of determinism which holds that the mental states of individuals are entirely determined by their psychological properties. It is a form of mentalism, and as such is opposed to physicalism.  The term "psychic determinism" was first introduced by the British philosopher John Searle in his book Minds, Brains, and Programs (1979). He argued that the software of a computer can be seen as a type of mental state, and that the physical properties of the computer's hardware cannot determine its behavior. Searle's view has been criticized for its artificiality, and it has been argued that computers cannot be seen as embodying true mental states.  In more recent years, the concept of psychic determinism has been used to critique certain forms of free will. Critics of free will argue that it is an illusion created by our understanding of events, and that our decisions are not truly free unless they are caused by our own actions and desires. They argue that psychic determinism undermines this freedom, because it shows that our decisions are ultimately determined by our psychological states.

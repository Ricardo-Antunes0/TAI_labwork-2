Project Isinglass was the code name given to an experiment conducted by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) in the early 1990s. The goal of the project was to create a powerful quantum computer.  The project began in 1989, when NSA mathematician John Preskill proposed building a quantum computer using a qubit-based system. The qubit was a unit of information that could exist in multiple states simultaneously. In 1992, NSA mathematician Michael A. Nielsen and physicist John C. Bose created the Isinglass algorithm, which was the first algorithm to successfully solve a problem using qubits.  In 1993, NSA mathematician Vernor Vinge and physicist Clifford W. Shull constructed a prototype quantum computer called the Quantum Computer Module (QCM). The QCM was able to solve small problems quickly, but it was not able to solve larger problems. In 1994, NSA mathematician Peter Shor showed that the QCM could solve problems much faster if it used a different algorithm called the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).  In 1995, NSA mathematician Gilles Brassard and physicist David J. Wineland created another prototype quantum computer called the Adaptive Quantum System (AQS). The AQS was able to solve larger problems than the QCM and it had more memory than the QCM. In 1996, NSA mathematicians Christopher Duch and Michael Nielsen created another prototype quantum computer called the Schuman-Krull Architecture (SKA). The SKA was able to solve even larger problems than the AQ

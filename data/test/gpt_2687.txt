The solution should also be efficient and cost-effective, meeting the financial goals of the organization.  There are several different types of solutions that can be architected, including software solutions, hardware solutions, and web solutions. Software solutions can include applications, systems or services. Hardware solutions include hardware components such as servers, networks or devices. Web solutions include web applications and web services.  Solution architecture is an important part of any IT project. It helps ensure that the project is successful by ensuring that all aspects of the problem are addressed and that the solution is well-designed and efficient.

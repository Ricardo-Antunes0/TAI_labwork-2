In common law, a writ (Anglo-Saxon gewrit, from Old Norse wrÄ«t, meaning a writing) is a order or command issued by a court of law.  Writs are distinguished from other orders or letters issued by a court, such as orders or judgments given in a civil case. A writ is an order from a court to a person or entity to do something specific, such as produce documents, appear in court, or pay money.

Hripsime (, died c. 290), also called Rhipsime, Ripsime, Ripsima, Arbsima or Arsema  was a martyr of Roman origin; she and her companions in martyrdom are venerated as some of the first Christian martyrs of Armenia. Biography According to legend, Hripsime was possibly of noble birth. She belonged to a community of virgins in Rome, numbering 35 under the leadership of Gayane. She was known to be extremely beautiful, and attracted the notice of Diocletian. To avoid his advances she, along with her community, fled the city, going first to Alexandria before settling in Vagharshapat. The varying accounts of her martyrdom diverge at this point. One story indicates that Hripsime again was noticed for her beauty, this time by King Tiridates III, who proceeded to pursue her. Upon being brought before him, she refused his advances and was punished by being roasted alive. Gayane was then put to death by Tiridates' soldiers, as were all the members of her community except for Nune (or Marine), who was later a missionary in Georgia and, as Saint Nino, is praised as the founder of the Georgian Orthodox Church.

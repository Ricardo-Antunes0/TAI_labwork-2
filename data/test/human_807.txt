The Cameron Inquiry, formerly the Commission of Inquiry on Hormone Receptor Testing, is a Canadian public judicial inquiry into the conduct of the Newfoundland and Labrador Eastern Health authority. The inquiry is investigating whether Eastern Health was at fault in the reporting of erroneous and delayed test results to breast cancer patients between 1997 and 2005, and in then failing to report the full scope of these errors. The inquiry developed ramifications for regional and national politics as the opposition Liberal Party questioned why the regional Progressive Conservative Party government had not intervened sooner in the crisis, and said that former deputy health minister Robert Thompson, who had been appointed to chair the inquiry, should stand down, prompting Newfoundland and Labrador premier Danny Williams to accuse the Liberals of a smear campaign. The inquiry, chaired by Justice Margaret Cameron, was called in May 2007 and released a report in March 2009. Background In May 2005 Eastern Health discovered errors in hormone receptor breast cancer test results from a histology lab in St Johns, Newfoundland. The tests were designed to register patients' hormone levels, and determine whether they could benefit from potentially life-saving hormone oncology treatments. The board commissioned the re-testing of results from up to 1,500 patients and alerted the office of premier Danny Williams of this development and of potential ensuing media interest. An hour after first contacting Williams's office, the board sent a second message with what communications director Karen Matthews described to the inquiry as a "stand-down" notice, saying the issue had been minimized; Matthews responded by withdrawing the office from high alert over the case. Former health minister John Ottenheimer told the inquiry that he wished to publicize the testing failures when they emerged in May 2005, but deferred to Eastern Health's request that he leave them to handle the affair internally.

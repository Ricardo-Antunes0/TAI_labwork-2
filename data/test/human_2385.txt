Coedarhydyglyn or Coedriglan, formerly Old Coedarhydyglyn (meaning 'the wood along the glen'), is a private Grade I listed neo-classical regency villa and estate on the western rim of Cardiff, less than half a mile from Culverhouse Cross, southeast Wales. It is accessed via the A48 road between Cardiff and St. Nicholas at the top of "The Tumble" hill leading up from Culverhouse Cross and Coedarhydyglyn Lane which leads to Drope to the north. The estate lies between the villages of  St Georges-super-Ely (to the northwest) and Downs (to the south) just inside the boundary of the Vale of Glamorgan. History Set in extensive gardens, the house, made of stone with stuccoed elevations and stone plinth, was built in 1820 for Llewelyn Traherne (1766â€“1841), replacing an earlier 18th century building, Old Coedarhydyglyn, which lay on the high ridge to the southwest to the east of the present walled garden. The earlier house had been built in 1767 and was owned by John Llewellin, who married Edmund Traherne of Castellau's sister. When John died in 1786, the estate was inherited by Llewelyn Traherne,  the son of his sister (who had married Edmund Traherne), and Coedarhydyglyn became the principal seat of the Traherne family. The old house was demolished in 1823, although parts remain. The replacement building was said to be "in the style of Edward Haycock Snr, of Shrewsbury, who designed Clytha House, Monmouthshire". Its owner, Reverend John Montgomery Traherne, during the 19th century, was a notable scholar and collector of scientific manuscripts. During the 1880s, Coedarhydyglyn was reportedly a breeding centre for the golden oriole. Sir Cennydd Traherne, born here on 14 December 1910, was a notable owner in the 20th century; he was Lord Lieutenant of Glamorgan from 1952 to 1974.

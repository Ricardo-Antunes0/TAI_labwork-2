The bronzed cowbird (once known as the Mexican cowbird) is a bird in the family Icteridae. The taxon was first described by James Lee Peters in 1854. It is found in North America, specifically in southern Texas and northern Mexico.  The bronzed cowbird is a medium-sized bird, measuring 19â€“21 cm in length and weighing 49 g. It has a mostly black body with a bronze sheen. The male has a green head and a red throat, while the female has a black head and a duller brown throat. The wings and tail are black, and the bill is brown with a red tip. The male has a high-pitched call, while the female's call is more subdued.  The bronzed cowbird feeds mainly on insects, but will also take small birds and mammals. It nests in hollow trees or buildings, laying two or three eggs.

Shery (or Sheri) is the name of an ancient Egyptian official who lived in the Old Kingdom, in the Fourth Dynasty. Sources Shery is known from his mastaba at Saqqara that was found and partly recorded in the nineteenth century AD. His wife was called Khentetek; a second woman appearing in his tomb decoration was called Inet and may have been a second wife (or mother?). Shery held the title “Overseer of all wab-priests of king Peribsen in the necropolis of king Senedj”, “Great One of the Ten of Upper Egypt” and “God´s Servant of Senedj”. Senedj´s name is written in archaic form and set in a cartouche, which is an anachronism, since the cartouche itself was not yet used until the end of 3rd Dynasty under king Huni. As the latter king is little known, the titles given to Shery are of special importance. The inscription for Shery suggests to Egyptologists, such as Wolfgang Helck, that Peribsen died during the reign of Senedj and that the relationship between the two kings was a peaceful one.

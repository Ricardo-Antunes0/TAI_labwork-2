Robert Michael Morris (May 6, 1940 â€“ May 30, 2017) was an American actor. He was known for his co-starring role as Mickey Deane in the reality television spoof The Comeback and as Mr. Lunt in the short-lived series Running Wilde. He also wrote over 100 plays. Biography Born in Kentucky, Morris obtained a Bachelor of Arts in English and art from the University of Dayton, as well as a Master of Fine Arts in playwriting from the Catholic University of America. He taught both high school and college theater before becoming a professional actor relatively late in life and relocating to New York City. "I moved to New York so I could find out what it was like to be a professional actor because my students were all asking questions and all I had was academic knowledge. I didn't have any real professional knowledge." Michael Patrick King, one of Morris's students, and Lisa Kudrow wrote his role in The Comeback with him in mind; King asked him to audition.

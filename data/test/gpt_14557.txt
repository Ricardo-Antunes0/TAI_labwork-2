The Saxon Stories (also known as Saxon Tales or Northmen's Tales) is a body of medieval English poetry, originally written in Old English, and comprising stories of the Saxon people. The poems are usually grouped into three cycles: the Beowulf Cycle, the Eldorado Cycle, and the Agricolan Cycle.  The poems were traditionally attributed to the anonymous author of the Old English poem Widsith, but recent scholarship has found that allusions in Widsith suggest a much earlier origin for the Saxon Stories. The first collection of Saxon Stories, known as the Exeter Book, was compiled in the late 8th century by an anonymous Anglo-Saxon monk at Exeter Cathedral.

Character.org is a worldwide network that empowers people of all ages to practice and model the ethical core values that shape our hearts, minds, and choices.Â Formerly known as the Character Education Partnership, they have relentlessly advocated for character since 1993 -- because they believe character is at the core of who we are. Today, Character.org creates and shares resources that support people around the globe, including their 11 Principles Framework for Schools: A Guide to Cultivating a Culture of Character. Their vision is to serve as the hub for all things character by inspiring, recognizing and celebrating thousands of people in schools and beyond who are champions for character. It is a "nonprofit, nonpartisan, nonsectarian, coalition of organizations and individuals committed to fostering effective character education in our nation's K-12 schools." Character.org's mission is "Leading the nation in helping schools develop people of good character for a just and compassionate society." A commentary in the November 14, 2007 edition of Education Week stated that "Just about anything can be called character education these days", whereas "Schools serious about helping students form good character rely heavily on Character.org's 11 Principles of Effective Character Education.".

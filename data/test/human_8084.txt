Kastner & Öhler is an Austrian chain of department stores, based in Graz, Styria, Austria, and mainly active in southern Austria. The family-run company dates back to a shop founded in 1873 by Karl Kastner and Herman Öhler. They were the first company in Central Europe to install fixed prices and ran mail orders, and built the first department store in Austria-Hungary. Today's company includes an online shop and the chain for sport, Gigasport, established in 1994. History  On 1 January 1873, Karl Kastner and Herman Öhler founded a shop for mercery in Troppau (today: Opava). When Karl Kastner was held up in Graz in 1883, he strolled through the town and found a free shop in the Sackstraße. He rented it, and it became the location of the company. The company was the first in Central Europe to introduce fixed prices, and to run a mail order service. They sent catalogues in several languages to customers throughout Austria-Hungary.

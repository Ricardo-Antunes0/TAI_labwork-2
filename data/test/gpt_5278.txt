The Schoof–Elkies–Atkin algorithm (SEA) is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations in two or more unknowns. It is named after its three inventors: G. Schoof, R. Elkies, and J. Atkin.  The SEA algorithm is a two-stage algorithm that first solves a system of linear equations in the first unknowns using a standard method, and then uses a modified version of the Nelder–Mead algorithm to solve the system in the second unknowns. The advantage of using the SEA algorithm is that it can be faster than other methods when the number of equations is large and the matrix coefficients are difficult to determine.

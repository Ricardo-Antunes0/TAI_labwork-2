Minimum audibility curve is a standardized graph used to illustrate the subjective audible perception of sound pressure levels. The graph plots the SPL (sound pressure level) against frequency, usually in logarithmic form.  The audibility of sound is subjective and dependent on a number of factors including hearing sensitivity, environment, and personal preferences. The minimum audibility curve is a standardized graph used to illustrate the subjective audible perception of sound pressure levels. The graph plots the SPL (sound pressure level) against frequency, usually in logarithmic form. The curve shows that low-frequency sounds are generally less audible than high-frequency sounds.

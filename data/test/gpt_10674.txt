Florence Cathedral, formally the  (; in Italian, Santa Maria del Fiore), is a medieval and Renaissance cathedral in Florence, Italy, the most famous of the city's many churches. The cathedral is the religious and cultural centre of Florence, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The original cathedral was built on the site of a 7th-century Romanesque church dedicated to Saint Florence, who is venerated as the patron saint of the city. The construction of the current cathedral began in 1296 and continued until 1564. The cathedral's design has resulted in its being described as both an "iconic example of Gothic architecture" and a "masterpiece of medieval art". The cathedral has been the site of many important ceremonies and events, including coronations and weddings.  The interior of the cathedral contains many notable works of art, including several 14th-century frescoes by Giotto and his pupils, Donatello's bronze statue of Saint George and the Dragon, Michelangelo's Piet√†, and Fra Angelico's Annunciation.

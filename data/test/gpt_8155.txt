My Brother Yves (, 1883) is a painting by the French artist Paul Cézanne.  The painting is currently in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.  Cézanne painted "My Brother Yves" in 1883, shortly after the death of his younger brother, Jules. The painting depicts Yves at a young age, sitting on the ground with his back to the viewer. He is holding a stick in his right hand and appears to be gazing off into the distance. The painting has been interpreted as a memorial to Yves, or as a self-portrait of Cézanne himself.

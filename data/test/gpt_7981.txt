Dialectical research or dialectical inquiry or dialectical thought is a form of inquiry that emphasizes the active engagement of ideas and concepts in a search for understanding. It is related to but distinct from hermeneutics, which is the study of the interpretation and meaning of texts. Dialectical research draws upon the tools and techniques of dialectics, which is a philosophical and methodical approach to understanding reality that emphasizes the relations between opposed concepts or phenomena.  Dialectical inquiry can be seen as a way to approach problems that involve multiple perspectives or viewpoints. It allows for a holistic view of the problem and allows for different aspects of the problem to be examined in an effort to find a solution that is both sustainable and equitable.   Dialectical inquiry is often used in fields such as social justice, environmentalism, education, health care, business, and science. It has been used to explore topics such as racism, sexism, environmentalism, poverty, violence, climate change, nuclear weapons proliferation, food production and consumption, and human rights.

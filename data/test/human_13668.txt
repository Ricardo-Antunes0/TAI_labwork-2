The Los Angeles Vanguard was a weekly newspaper published in Los Angeles, California and established in 1976 after the closure of the Los Angeles Free Press. Dave Lindorff was a founder and editor, along with journalists Woodrow "Tommy" Thompson, Dorothy Thompson, Ben Pleasants, Ron Ridenour and Jim Horowitz. According to Lindorff, the Vanguard was infiltrated by an undercover member of LA's Public Disorder and Intelligence Division (PDID) squad, under Daryl Gates. The lawsuit CAPA v. Gates, with the Coalition Against Police Abuse (CAPA) as one of two dozen or so plaintiffs, later sued the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) on First Amendment grounds, exposing unlawful harassment, surveillance, and infiltration of the progressive movement in Los Angeles by LAPD agentsâ€”and a link to a right-wing outfit in San Francisco called Western Goals, which was assembling the collected spy dossiers and making them available to law enforcement nationwide and to the federal spy agencies that were feeling hamstrung by the post Watergate reforms limiting such spying.3  The lawsuit against Gates and the LAPD proved successful. A police commission ordered the disbandment of the PDID, which took place in January 1983.

Koggala Lagoon ( Koggala Kalapuwa) is a large lagoon on the east coast of Sri Lanka. It is the largest lagoon on the east coast and one of the largest in the country. The lagoon is about 25 km long and 10 km wide, with a maximum depth of about 2.5 m. The lagoon is surrounded by a coral reef.  The lagoon was formed about 8,000 years ago as a result of the withdrawal of the sea. The lagoon is fed by a number of small streams and rivers that run into it from the surrounding hills. The lagoon is used for fishing, bathing, and water sports. It is also used for agriculture, particularly the cultivation of paddy fields.

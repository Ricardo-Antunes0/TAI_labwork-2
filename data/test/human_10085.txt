The Mud Bath is a 1914 oil-on-canvas painting by David Bomberg.  The work is considered a masterpiece of Bomberg's work in this period.  Bomberg was a founder member of the London Group, and the painting is considered a leading example of Vorticism, although Bomberg resisted being described as a Vorticist. The painting is a striking composition of human figures formed from white and blue geometric planes and angles, in a rectangular bath of vibrant red surrounded by a landscape of mustard brown, arranged around a brown and black vertical element (perhaps a column at the baths).  There is a suggestion that the bathers are waving their arms as if in a Bacchanalian revel.  The scene is based on Schewzik Russian Vapour Baths in Brick Lane, Whitechapel, near Bomberg's home in east London, which was used by the local Jewish population for cleanliness and for religious observances, including the mikveh ritual bath.  Bomberg's Jewishness was a very important part of his identity as an artist.  The bathing room, with a communal bath approximately 10-foot square and balcony above, was open to either men and women on different days, and may also have been the inspiration for his 1913 work, Ju-Jitsu.

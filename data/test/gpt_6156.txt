Game of Shadows: Barry Bonds, BALCO, and the Quest for an Unsuspected Crime (2009) is a non-fiction book by San Francisco Chronicle reporters Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada. The book tells the story of Bonds' relationship with the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative Research Center (BALCO), and allegations of steroid use made by Williams and Fainaru-Wada.  The book was published on October 10, 2009, one day after the release of the Mitchell Report, which implicated Bonds in using performance-enhancing drugs. The book was banned by Major League Baseball (MLB) before it was published, and excerpts were published in The New York Times. In 2011, Game of Shadows was made into a feature film directed by Peter Berg.

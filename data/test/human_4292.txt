Euophrys omnisuperstes (the species name means standing above everything), the Himalayan jumping spider, is a small and toxic jumping spider that lives at elevations of up to  in the Himalayas, including Mount Everest, making it a candidate for the highest known permanent resident on Earth. They are found among rocky debris, feeding on tiny, stray springtails and flies. Discovery In 1924, Richard Hingston was the naturalist on the British expedition to Mount Everest. In 1925, he reported that spiders had been observed living permanently in rocky areas surrounded by snow and ice at , about  above the highest plant growth. His observation that "for food they eat one another" was later described as a "self-defeating notion" and helped to support the view that the spiders had been blown there and were not permanent residents. In 1954, Lawrence W. Swan joined an American expedition to Makalu in the Himalayas, and re-discovered the jumping spiders that Hingston had observed. Swan confirmed that they were indeed permanent residents from  to above . When the spider was later described scientifically as Euophrys omnisuperstes, it was found to be the same species as specimens collected by T. G. Longstaff in 1922 (i.e. before Hingston's observations in 1924) around the Everest base camp, at the lower altitude of .

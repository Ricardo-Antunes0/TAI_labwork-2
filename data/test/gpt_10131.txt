A social deduction game is a game in which players must deduce the true identities of other players. The game is typically played with a group of people, and the goal is to find out who among the group is the "criminal".  The game begins with each player being given a card with a different name on it. The players then take turns asking a question, and the player who answered the question must then either put their card on the table or discard one of their cards. If the player has a card with the same name as someone who has already been revealed as being the criminal, they are then revealed as the criminal and must take a penalty.  The game is won when all of the players have been revealed as criminals, or when no one can answer any more questions.

The Dale Warland Singers (DWS) was a 40-voice professional chorus based in St. Paul, Minnesota, founded in 1972 by Dale Warland and disbanded in 2004.  They performed a wide variety of choral repertoire but specialized in 20th-century music and commissioned American composers extensively.  In terms of sound, the DWS was known for its purity of tone, intonation, legato sound and stylistic range.  During their existence, the DWS performed roughly 400 concerts and recorded 29 CDs. Biography Dale Warland was born in Fort Dodge, Iowa, on 14 April 1932, the son of farmers and grandson of Norwegian immigrants.  His parents were not highly educated but instilled in him a love of beauty and the arts.  Both his father and grandfather sang in the local church choir. (His grandfather held the attendance record for singing in rehearsal and Sunday worship without a single absence.)  Warland began taking piano lessons with the church choir director at the age of five and also sang every day in his one-room schoolhouse.

The Inner German border (  or ) is a internationally recognised border between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. It was created on 9 November 1949, when the three western zones of postwar Germany were merged.  The Inner German border separated East Germany from the Western sectors of what had been the German Reich and it was also the dividing line between East and West Berlin. The Inner German border runs for 815 kilometres (500 miles) along the former eastern borders of East Germany, namely the Oderâ€“Neisse line and the Curzon Line.   The Inner German border is marked by watchtowers, barbed wire, and military patrols. It remains a source of tension, as it is a symbol of the Cold War. In 1990, following German reunification, much of the Inner German border was removed and replaced with an open-air museum.

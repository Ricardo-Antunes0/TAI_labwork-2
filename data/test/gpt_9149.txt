IPA Braille is the modern standard Braille alphabet for the blind. It is based on the French Braille alphabet, but has been modified to allow for the use of more contractions and symbols.  IPA Braille was developed in the early 20th century by Louis Braille, a French educator and author, and has since become the most common form of Braille used by the blind worldwide. It is not as widely used in North America as it is in other parts of the world, but it is gaining popularity there, and some American organizations are working to increase its use.  IPA Braille is divided into 8 main blocks: letters, numerals, punctuation, basic words, compound words, phrases, and clauses. Each block consists of six key letters (a-j), one supplementary letter (k-z), and one symbol that indicates its function. There are also two additional letters (ß and ß) that are only used in Germanic languages.

State consequentialism, also known as Mohist consequentialism, is a form of consequentialism that holds that the consequences of an action are the only thing that matter in determining whether or not that action is right.  State consequentialism is a form of consequentialism that holds that the consequences of an action are the only thing that matter in determining whether or not that action is right. It is distinct from other forms of consequentialism, such as utilitarianism, in that it does not focus solely on the happiness of individuals. State consequentialism also differs from deontological ethics, in which actions are judged solely on their own standards, rather than the consequences they have for others.  State consequentialism has been used to justify a number of different actions, including military interventions and economic policies. It has been criticised for its lack of specificity and for its assumption that governments always act in the best interests of their citizens.

Kan'Nal is a rock music band first formed in the early 1990s in the city of Durban, South Africa. The band's music is characterized by its hard-edged sound and strong political messages.  Kan'Nal was formed in 1991 by vocalist Mbuyiseni "Mbuya" Ntuli, guitarist Robert Ndhlovu, bassist Sbu Ndlovu, and drummer Vusi Malinga. The band's original lineup was augmented by keyboardist Lindiwe Mazibuko in 1993. The band's name is an Xhosa word meaning "a place where the sun sets".  Kan'Nal rose to prominence in the late 1990s with the release of their debut album, "Inkandla". The album was critically acclaimed and helped to cement Kan'Nal's reputation as one of South Africa's most influential rock bands. The album's lead single, "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika", became a anthem for the anti-apartheid movement and is still widely played at political rallies across the country.   The band released two more albums before disbanding in 2002. In 2006, Kan'Nal reunited to release their fifth album, "No Land Is Free". The album was well-received and helped to revive Kan'Nal's popularity. The band has since toured extensively throughout South Africa and Europe and is currently working on their sixth album.

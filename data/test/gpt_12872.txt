The Sheikh al-Karama Forces is an armed Islamist group active in the Sinai Peninsula and is considered a terrorist organisation by the Egyptian government. The group is believed to have links to terrorist organisations such as al-Qaeda, and has been blamed for attacks on Egyptian security forces and civilians.  The Sheikh al-Karama Forces was formed in 2013 by Sheikh Abu al-Fadl al-Karama, a senior figure in the Egyptian Islamic Jihad. The group's stated aim is to overthrow the Egyptian government and replace it with an Islamic state. The Sheikh al-Karama Forces has been involved in a number of attacks on Egyptian security forces and civilians, as well as suicide bombings targeting Israeli targets. In November 2017, the group claimed responsibility for a bomb attack on a bus carrying Egyptian soldiers that killed at least 24 people.

Aubrey S. "Red" Newman (1903–1994) was a noted American composer and musicologist.  Newman was born in Brooklyn, New York City, on October 27, 1903, to a musical family. His father, Arthur Newman (1863–1951), was a violinist and composer; his mother, Ida (née Kingsbury; 1872–1963), was a singer and pianist. Aubrey S. Newman began his musical studies at the age of five with his father. He continued his studies at the Juilliard School of Music with Clarence Lee Burton and J.S. Bach scholar Wilhelm Friedemann Bach-Yonhoffer. In 1925 he completed his undergraduate studies at Columbia University where he studied with Vincent d'Indy and Paul Hindemith.  In 1928 Newman won the Pulitzer Prize for Music for his cantata "The Dream of Gerontius". That same year he became an associate professor of music at Harvard University, where he remained until 1958. During this time he also served as chairman of the composition department from 1946 to 1948 and as dean of the Faculty of Arts from 1958 to 1960.  In 1959 Newman became the first American composer to be awarded a Nobel Prize in Music. The citation read: "For his creative work in which he has enriched the spiritual heritage of mankind by reviving tonality from its apathy." Newman died on December 24, 1994, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

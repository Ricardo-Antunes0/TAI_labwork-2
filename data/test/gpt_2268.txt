The Cobray Company was an American developer, manufacturer and distributor of firearms and ammunition, as well as a provider of security services. It was founded in 1946 by brothers Eugene and Raymond Cobray.  The company was best known for its pistols, such as the Cobray CM9 and the Cobray CM21, but also manufactured rifles, shotguns and ammunition. It went bankrupt in 2002 after being sued by the United States government for alleged participation in international gun trafficking.

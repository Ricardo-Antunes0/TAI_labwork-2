Although raised Mormon, he smoked cigars and drank vodka as an adult. He moved to California in the 1930s due to a suggestion by Earl Warren.  Jarvis bought his home at 515 North Crescent Heights Boulevard in Los Angeles for $8,000 in 1941.  By 1976, it was assessed at $80,000.  He married his third wife, Estelle Garcia, around 1965.

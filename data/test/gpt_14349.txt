Duke Farms is an estate that was in the Duke family for over 260 years. The current Duke family owns the estate and manages it as a working farm. The main crops grown on the estate are tobacco, hay, corn, and soybeans. There is also a small dairy and a winery on the property.  The Duke Farms estate was first settled in the early 1700s by a group of English settlers. The Duke family took over the property in 1857 and began farming it. In 1917, the estate was sold to Henry Ford and became part of his Greenfield Plantation. Ford used the estate as a model for his Ford Model T factory. The estate was eventually sold to the current Duke family in 1987. Today, Duke Farms is a working farm that produces crops and dairy products.

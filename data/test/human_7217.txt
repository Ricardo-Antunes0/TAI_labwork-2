Peter L. Gluck (born November 19, 1939) is principal of GLUCK+ (formerly Peter Gluck and Partners), an architecture firm based in New York City since 1972. A monograph of his work, The Modern Impulse, was published by ORO Editions in 2008. Gluck has designed buildings ranging from structures such as hotels, schools, university buildings and affordable housing to churches, homes, corporate interiors and historic restorations. Many of his projects regularly win national and international design awards and have been published in architectural journals and books in many countries. Gluck's son is director Will Gluck. Education Gluck received his Bachelor of Arts from Yale University in 1962. He received his Masters in Architecture at the Yale School of Architecture studying under dean Paul Rudolph (architect), and noted architects James Stirling, Shadrach Woods and Henning Larsen. The influence of Louis Kahn who served as a design critic and professor of architecture at Yale School of Architecture from 1947 to 1957 was also still deeply felt. Toward the end of his program the Yale Building Project was initiated. A shift in the focus of learning to direct experience and away from the drafting room coincided with a design-build culture which already existed at Yale. "The design-build culture was largely initiated by two members of the class of 1965, David E. Sellers and Peter Gluck. In 1963, Sellers helped Gluck to build a vacation house for Gluck's parents in Westhampton, New York. A cedar-clad house which was supported on telephone poles took two summers to build and was featured in a 1967 article in Progressive Architecture which described the young Gluck as "plunging headlong into architecture--designing, building and developing."

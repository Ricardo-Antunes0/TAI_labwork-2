Krabbe disease (KD) (also known as globoid-cellular leukodystrophy, GM2-gangliosidosis, and GM2-gangliosidotic myelopathy) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency or absence of the enzyme GM2 gangliosidase. The disease results in progressive damage to the central nervous system, which can lead to death within a few years of diagnosis. There is no known cure for KD, and Treatment typically involves supportive care and medication to improve muscle function.

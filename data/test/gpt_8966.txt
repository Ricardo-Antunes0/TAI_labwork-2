Francium is a chemical element with the symbol Fr and atomic number 97. A metallic element, it is a member of the actinide series. It is produced in minute quantities by neutron irradiation of lighter elements. Francium was first isolated in 1939 by the French chemist Ã‰mile Blondel.  Francium is a transuranic element that occurs naturally only in very small amounts. Although it has a low melting point, Francium is resistant to oxidation and so can be found in the atmosphere as an aerosol. It has a relatively short half-life of only 2.7 minutes, which means that it is not long-lived on Earth.

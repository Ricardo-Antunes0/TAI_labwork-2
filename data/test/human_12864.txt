HAIR-AN syndrome consists of hyperandrogenism (HA), insulin resistance (IR) and acanthosis nigricans (AN). It is a rare disease which is a subset of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Polycystic ovary syndrome is a condition in females in which there is an increase in the production of androgen (male hormone), leading to an expression of male-like characters in the female body. The name HAIR-AN is made up of the three conditions of which it consists. The commonly used term "HAIR-AN" is a generic description of the features of SIR (severe insulin resistance)." Although HAIR-AN can result from two very different types of abnormalities – blocking antibodies against the insulin receptor or genetically absent/reduced insulin receptor number/function – patients with both types have high levels of androgens (male hormones). Research on the two types of HAIR-AN demonstrated that patients with both forms of HAIR-AN had very high levels of insulin and, critically, that it was the high insulin that caused the elevation in androgen. The patient affected by HAIR-AN syndrome has insulin resistance inside their body. Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body produces insulin but does not use it properly. This causes the pancreas to produce more insulin in the body. High levels of insulin stimulate the ovaries to make excess of androgen, leading to excessive hair growth, acne and irregular periods in the female body. Insulin resistance can also lead to diabetes, heart disease and excessive growth and darkening of the skin (acanthosis nigricans)

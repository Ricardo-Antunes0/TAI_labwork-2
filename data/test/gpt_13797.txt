Operation Snowball was a conventional explosive test conducted by the United States in November 1994. The test was code-named Operation Snowball and involved the detonation of a nuclear device underground at the Nevada Test Site.  The test was conducted as part of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) verification process and was designed to measure the effects of a nuclear explosion on the subsurface environment. The test was considered a success, as no radioactive contamination was detected outside of the test area.

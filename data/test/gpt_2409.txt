There are no less than six fables about the insect. The first is found in Aesop's Fables (6th century BC), in which an insect begs for food from a bird, but the bird does not want to feed it, so the insect begs from a second bird and from a third, and so on. The second is found in The Arabian Nights Entertainments (12th century AD), in which an insect asks a lion what he is doing, and the lion replies that he is sleeping. The third is found in The Canterbury Tales (13th century AD), in which an insect asks a monk where he is going, and the monk replies that he is going to Rome. The fourth is found in La Fontaine's Fables (16th century AD), in which an insect tells a fox how to catch a rabbit. The fifth is found in Don Quixote (1605-1669), in which an insect tells Sancho Panza how to catch a windmill. The sixth is found in Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726-1728), in which an insect tells Gulliver how to escape from the emperor of Lilliput.

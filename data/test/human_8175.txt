Giliana Berneri or Giliane Berneri (5 October 1919 â€“ 19 July 1998) was a French doctor of medicine and a libertarian communist activist. Life Giliana Berneri was the second daughter of the eminent Italian anarchist and academic Camillo Berneri and his similarly focused wife Giovanna Berneri (born Giovanna Caleffi).   Giliana and her sister were born in Tuscany, but the family fled to France in 1926 in order to escape the Fascist Mussolini government.   The father's scathing anti-Fascist newspaper articles had marked the family out for persecution.   In France he was unable to find permanent employment, and frequently went into hiding to avoid the unwelcome attentions of the Italian Security Services.   Nevertheless, there was considerable solidarity among the political anti-Fascist exiles in Paris and eventually Giovanna, the girls' mother, was able to set up a fruit and vegetable shop in a popular quarter.   Money continued to be short, but the family survived and the daughters' education was financed.   Both of the daughters qualified as medical doctors.   Giliana's specialisms became Pediatrics and Psychoanalysis.

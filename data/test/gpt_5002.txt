The former Brandon Park at Fairy Meadow was a large municipal park in the city of Manchester, England. It was the largest city park in Europe and one of the largest in the world at its peak. The park encompassed 1,700 acres (7.4 km2) and was home to a variety of wildlife, including lions, tigers and elephants.  The park was created in 1838 on land that had been part of the Manor of Brandon and was originally known as Fairy Meadow Park. The land was donated to the city by the 7th Duke of Devonshire. The first entrance to the park was on Watling Street at the junction with Medlock Street. In 1883, a bridge over the River Irwell was built to connect Fairy Meadow Park with Brandon Park East, which had been created on land that had once been part of Brandon Hall. The two parks were merged in 1936 and became known as Brandon Park.  The park's heyday came in the 1930s and 1940s when it was home to a number of attractions, including a zoo, a circus, an amusement park and a water garden. In 1969, Brandon Park was closed to the public and turned into a military training ground. It was returned to public use in 1985 and is now managed by Manchester City Council.  Today, Brandon Park is a popular recreation area for residents of Manchester and visitors from around the UK. It is home to a number of attractions, including a football stadium, a basketball arena and a skatepark.

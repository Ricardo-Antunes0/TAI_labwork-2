Ngong Ping  is a highland in the eastern New Territories of Hong Kong. It is located northeast of the New Territories East and is part of the Tai Po District. The mountain ranges located in the east and northeast of Ngong Ping form part of the eastern escarpment of Hong Kong.   The Ngong Ping massif is composed of sedimentary rocks that were laid down in the Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous and Paleogene periods. These rocks were formed from the accumulation of sand, silt, clay and boulders which were dropped by the surrounding mountains. The massif is also made up of igneous and metamorphic rocks, including granite, schist and gneiss.  Ngong Ping is a popular tourist destination for hiking, camping and rock climbing. The mountain also has several waterfalls, including Ngong Ping Ha (Dragon's Head Falls), Ngong Ping Tso (Sheep Falls) and Ngong Ping Kok (Cherry Blossom Falls).

Lajjun (, al-LajjÅ«n) was a large Palestinian Arab village in the Northern District of the British Mandate of Palestine, located east of Nablus. Its population was 1,534 in 1945. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, it was depopulated by the Israel Defense Forces during Operation Dani.  Lajjun is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as a place where King Solomon built a palace. It is also mentioned in Islamic sources, most notably in al-Tabari's history of the Abbasid caliphate.

The P-9 Project was the codename given to an operation by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to track and monitor Soviet submarine activity in the North Atlantic Ocean. The project was first conceived in the early 1960s and was operational from the early 1970s until its disbandment in the late 1980s.  The P-9 Project was one of several CIA initiatives aimed at countering the Soviet Union's submarine campaign in the North Atlantic Ocean. Other initiatives included the development of improved monitoring equipment, the training of maritime intelligence personnel, and the development of anti-submarine warfare doctrine.  The P-9 Project employed a variety of techniques to track Soviet submarines. These included conducting acoustic surveillance, intercepting communications, and studying Soviet naval tactics. In addition, the CIA used its own submarines to engage Soviet submarines on occasion. The project was ultimately successful in limiting Soviet submarine operations in the North Atlantic Ocean.

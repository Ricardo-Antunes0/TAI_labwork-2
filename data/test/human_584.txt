HMS Calliope was a  light cruiser of the Royal Navy under construction at the outbreak of the First World War. Both Calliope and her sister ship  were based on the earlier cruiser . They were effectively test ships for the use of geared turbines which resulted in the one less funnel. They also received slightly thicker armour. They led into the first of the Cambrian subclass. Design Eight light cruisers were ordered for the Royal Navy in the 1913 budget. The six ships of the Caroline class used conventional direct drive turbine engines but Calliope and Caroline each had a different engine design using geared reduction to match optimum working speeds of turbines and propellers. This followed experimental designs ordered in 1911 using geared high pressure turbines for the destroyers  and  and in 1912 using gearing for both high pressure and low pressure turbines in destroyers  and .

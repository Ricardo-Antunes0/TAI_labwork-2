Rear-Admiral Valentine Collard (c. 1770 â€“ 18 March 1846) was a Royal Navy officer of the early nineteenth century who is best known for his service in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Born into a naval family, Collard served at numerous engagements of the wars, including the Siege of Toulon, operations against Corsica, the Battle of Cape St Vincent, the Siege of Genoa, the Battle of Copenhagen and numerous smaller actions off the Netherlands, Egypt and in the Baltic Sea. His last active service came in 1810, after which he retired to Teddington in Middlesex. In his later years he suffered severe ill-health and the loss of his first and second wives, leading him to commit suicide. Life Valentine Collard was born in approximately 1770 into a naval family: two of his uncles were Admiral Sampson Edwards and Captain Valentine Edwards who was killed in a shipwreck in 1794. Pursuing a naval career, Collard first appears in the records as a midshipman at the end of the American War of Independence in 1783. For four years he was under his uncle Captain Valentine Edwards in HMS Shark off Scotland before taking a position on HMS Champion with Sampson Edwards. He later served in HMS Iphigenia, and at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793 was transferred to HMS St George in the Mediterranean. There he took part in the Siege of Toulon engaging French Republican artillery along the siege lines, and in October 1793 was with the force that captured a French ship lying in Genoa harbour at the action of 5 October 1793.

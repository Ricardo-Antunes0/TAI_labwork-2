The S-Bahn Mittelelbe ("Central Elbe S-Bahn", called the S-Bahn Magdeburg until 2014) is part of the public transport network of the metropolitan area of Magdeburg, the state capital of Saxony-Anhalt. The S-Bahn is operated by the Elbe Saale Bahn, a subsidiary of DB Regio Südost, on behalf of the Nahverkehrsservice Sachsen-Anhalt ("public transport service of Saxony-Anhalt", a state government agency that plans, manages and funds public transport services in the state). The S-Bahn currently consists of one line between Schönebeck-Salzelmen, Magdeburg, Stendal and Wittenberge, using the Schönebeck–Güsten, Magdeburg–Leipzig and Magdeburg–Wittenberge lines. History The Magdeburg S-Bahn was opened on 29 September 1974 as a 38 kilometre-long line, on the Zielitz–Magdeburg–Schönebeck-Salzelmen route, running north–south. The halts (Haltepunkte) of Schönebeck-Frohse, Schönebeck Süd and Zielitz Ort were opened after 1974. The halt of Barleber See is served only between early May and late October as it serves leisure traffic to the lake of the same name, which is located north of Magdeburg. There was an hourly connection between Schönebeck and Haldensleben in GDR times with an S-Bahn set shortened to one carriage and hauled by a DR class 110 or DR class 112 diesel locomotive. Passengers could travel on this train to Magdeburg-Rothensee on an S-Bahn fare.

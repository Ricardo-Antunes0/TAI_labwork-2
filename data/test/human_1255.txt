Adenomera araucaria is a species of frog in the family Leptodactylidae. It is endemic to southern Brazil, where it occurs in the southern part of the Serra Geral in the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. Description Adult males measure  and adult females  in snoutâ€“vent length. The body is robust and the limbs are short. In males, the snout is subelliptical or nearly acuminate in dorsal view, but more rounded in females. The tympanum is distinct, but the supra-tympanic fold is poorly developed. The canthus rostralis is rounded and indistinct. The finger tips are rounded whereas the toe tips are slightly swollen, but neither have discs. No webbing is present. Skin is smooth, but a distinct lateral fold, broken into small glandular segments, runs from the eye over the tympanum to the groin. Dorsal coloration is variable, with various shades light or dark brown, orange-brown, tan, or gray. There is a usually inconspicuous pattern of longitudinally arranged, irregular, dark marks. A light mid-dorsal stripe is usually present. The venter is usually white with some gray dotting, but occasionally very dark with many melanophores.

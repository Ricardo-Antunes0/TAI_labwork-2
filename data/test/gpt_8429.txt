Body piercing, which is a form of body modification, is the practice of inserting a sharp object, such as a metal barbell, into the skin to create a piercing. Piercers use a variety of techniques to place the piercing, including hand and power placement. Piercing can be done in a number of locations on the body, including the navel, eyebrow, tongue, lip, and genitalia.  Body piercing has progressed from traditional tribal markings to elaborate designs and styles. The most common types of piercings are ear piercing, navel piercing, and nipple piercing. Body piercing is also commonly done for body art, as part of an outfit or to show personal style. Some people use body piercing to cope with psychological issues or as an escape from daily life.  There is no evidence that body piercing is associated with any health risks. However, some people choose not to have piercings done due to concerns about infection or pain. There is also the risk of injury if the piercing goes wrong. Body piercers must take special precautions to avoid injuring their clients, and many use protective equipment such as gloves and a mask. Body piercing can be addictive for some people, and can lead to complications if it is not done correctly.

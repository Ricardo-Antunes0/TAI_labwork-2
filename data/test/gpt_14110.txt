The Huysman Gallery was an art gallery located in the artist's former residence at 8 Huysmans Lane in the city of Rotterdam, Netherlands. The gallery operated from 1954 until 1987.  The gallery was founded by Piet Huysman and his wife Wieke, who were both artists themselves. The Huysmans were one of the first artists' families to live and work in Rotterdam. Piet Huysman was a painter and sculptor, while Wieke Huysman was a printmaker and illustrator.  The gallery specialized in Dutch and Flemish painting of the 17th century, as well as 19th century Dutch and Belgian painting. It also exhibited work by contemporary Dutch and Belgian artists. The gallery was notable for its extensive collection of etchings by Frans Hals, which is one of the largest collections of this type in the world.  The Huysmans Gallery closed its doors in 1987 due to financial problems.

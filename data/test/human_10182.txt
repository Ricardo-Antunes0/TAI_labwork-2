Cas12a (CRISPR associated protein 12a, previously known as Cpf1) is an RNA-guided endonuclease of that forms part of the CRISPR system in some bacteria and is used by scientists to modify DNA. It originates as part of a bacterial immune mechanism, where it serves to destroy the genetic material of viruses and thus protect the cell and colony from viral infection. Cas12a and other CRISPR associated endonucleases are unique in that their use of a guide RNA makes this action highly selective; they only cut DNA when it is adjacent to a certain sequence of nucleotides. In the organisms from which it originates, this guide RNA is a copy of a piece of the genome from a virus that previously infected the cell. It is of interest to researchers because it can be used to make highly targeted modifications of DNA or RNA, similar to the better known CRISPR/Cas9 system. Cas12a is distinguished from Cas9 by being smaller and simpler, not requiring a tracrRNA, and creating sticky rather than blunt ends at the cut site. These and other differences may make it more suitable in certain applications. Beyond its use in basic research, CRISPR/Cas12a could have applications in the treatment of genetic illnesses and in implementing gene drives.

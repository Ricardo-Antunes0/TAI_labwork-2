Ann Manley (c. 1828 â€“ after 1870) was an American brothel proprietor and street brawler who, with her husband James, operated a brothel in Baltimore, Maryland, in the middle 19th century. She was known for a violent disposition. She is credited with saving most of the band of the 6th Massachusetts Regiment from certain lynching in April 1861, at the outbreak of the American Civil War. Background Manley, and her husband James, were Whigs, and later American Party, loyalists who operated a brothel on Eastern Avenue in the Fell's Point of Baltimore and were among "the most desperate characters" in the red light district. James Manley was a party "rough", responsible for harassing and attacking Democrats, and intimidating voters on election day; he was associated with the party's street enforcers, the Plug Uglies. His political connections helped him secure patronage jobs, including a long stint of service as a city night watchman. This was despite his having been arrested at least once for beating Ann. Ann herself had been arrested on at least one occasion for severely beating one of her prostitutes and was known to have a penchant for brawling. According to a period report in The Baltimore Sun, Ann Manley was also arrested in 1852 after attacking a police officer who was "beaten very severely, having been struck repeatedly".

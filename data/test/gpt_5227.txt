The term FEMA trailer, or FEMA travel trailer, is used to describe a type of recreational vehicle (RV)  with a unique,  uniform design.   FEMA trailers were originally built in the 1950s for U.S. Forest Service personnel and their families to use while camping or traveling in the backcountry. They are now popular with recreational vehicle enthusiasts because of their unique design, low price, and fuel efficiency.  Today, FEMA trailers are available in a variety of configurations and prices. They can be used as family campers, travel trailers, or fifth wheels. Most FEMA trailers are built on either a recreational vehicle or van chassis and come equipped with a variety of amenities, including a kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom.

Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is a vector-borne infectious disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. The disease is endemic in the United States, Europe, and other parts of the world. Lyme disease is classically divided into early and late manifestations based on the time from when symptoms begin to appear until the person is symptomatic or has died. Early Lyme disease, which accounts for 85% of cases, presents with intermittent fever, malaise, and a rash between two weeks and three months after being bitten by an infected tick. Late Lyme disease, which occurs in 15% to 20% of cases, presents with more severe symptoms including arthritis, carditis, and neurologic involvement. There is no known cure for Lyme disease, though treatment with antibiotics often results in a cure.  Lyme disease is a vector-borne infectious disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi.

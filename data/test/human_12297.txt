Creation and casting In 1994, TV Week revealed Neighbours would be introducing "a younger, livelier look with six regular characters under the age of 18." Shortly after, the character of Stonefish was created and introduced to the show. Engelman was cast in the role and he told a writer for Inside Soap that his first script said that the character got his nickname because he looked like a stonefish. The actor quipped "They'd written that before they'd even cast me! When I got my script I was like 'What the hell does a stonefish look like anyway?!'" Stonefish became the first member of the Rebecchi family to arrive in Erinsborough. He was later joined by his mother, father, brother and cousin. The character left in 1996.

Sean Patrick Connelly (born 26 June 1970) is an English former professional footballer, currently working as the lead physio at  the Football Association of Wales. Career Connelly  qualified as a Chartered Physiotherapist in 1993 and began his football career at his local side Hallam before Stockport County manager Danny Bergara offered him a professional contract at the club, one that he accepted on finishing his degree in physiotherapy. He helped Stockport to the semi finals of the 1996-97 League Cup, beating Premier League teams Blackburn Rovers, West Ham United and Southampton en route. In the semi finals they faced another Premier League team in Middlesbrough. Boro won the first leg 2–0 at Edgeley Park. In the second leg at the Riverside, Connelly gave Stockport an early lead. However they were unable to score again and lost 2–1 in aggregate. His impressive form even generated rumours of a possible move to Liverpool, although this failed to materialise.   The defender played under four different managers during his nine-year stay at Stockport – Bergara, Dave Jones, Gary Megson and Andy Kilner. He eventually left in 2001 after former manager Jones persuaded him to join him at Wolves. In 2002, he was inducted into the Stockport County hall of fame.

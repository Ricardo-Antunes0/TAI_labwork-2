In video games, a quick time event (QTE) is an event in which the player must respond quickly to a displayed cue in order to complete the event successfully. QTEs are typically used to dramatize key moments in video games, such as defeating an enemy or retrieving a hidden item.  Quick time events were first used in the Sega Genesis game Sonic the Hedgehog 2. They have since become a staple of video game design and are often used to create suspense or tension in gameplay.

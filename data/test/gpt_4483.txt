The SAT  is a standardized test that is administered in the United States and Canada by the College Board. It assesses critical reading, mathematics, and writing skills.  The SAT was first administered in 1926 as a test of college-level mathematics. In 1934, the test was revised to assess critical reading, writing, and mathematics skills. The SAT has been revised several times since then to reflect changes in college curricula and to improve measurement precision.  As of 2016, the SAT has been administered in the United States by the College Board and in Canada by the Educational Testing Service. Approximately 240,000 students take the SAT each year.

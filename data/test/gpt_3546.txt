Farthest North describes the most northerly latitude reached by a human or a machine. The record was set by the Russian crew of the Mir space station on December 3, 2006, when their spacecraft reached a latitude of 83°51′N.  The Farthest North is an important geographical landmark, as it is the point beyond which there is no sunlight during the summer months. It is also an important landmark for navigation, as it is the point from which charts are based for sailing in the Arctic Ocean.

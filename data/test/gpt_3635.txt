Jaeger's Ferry was a major river ferry crossing on the Hudson River in the U.S. state of New York. The ferry was located at the junction of the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers, about 12 miles (19 km) north of Albany. It was in operation from 1825 to 1895, when it was replaced by the George Washington Bridge. Jaeger's Ferry served as a major transportation link for goods, people, and horses between the upstate New York region and the states to the south and west. The ferry played an important role in the development of upstate New York, serving as a commercial gateway to markets in Canada and the Great Lakes region.  The original Jaeger's Ferry was a small steamship built in 1825 by German immigrants Jacob and Nicholas Jaeger at their kiln near Fort Hunter on the west bank of the Hudson River opposite present-day West Point. The ferry crossed the river on a wooden raft named "Erie", which was propelled by a steam engine that had been brought over from Europe. The engine was powered by coal mined nearby at Black Rock Mine. At its peak, Jaeger's Ferry carried over 10,000 passengers and 350 tons (300 metric tons) of cargo each day between Albany and Kingston on the south bank of the Hudson River. In 1895, a new bridge was built just downstream of Jaeger's Ferry at Kingston, eliminating the need for passengers to cross the river.

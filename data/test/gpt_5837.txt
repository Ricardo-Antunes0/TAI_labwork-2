Eucalyptus gillii, known as the curly mallee, is a mallee tree that is endemic to Western Australia. It grows to a height of around 10 metres and has non-descript smooth grey bark. The leaves are alternately arranged and are 3–5 centimetres long and 1.5–2.5 centimetres wide. The inflorescence is a dense, globular cluster of white flowers that are 5–6 millimetres long. The fruit is a red or black berries that are 2–2.5 centimetres wide.   The curly mallee is found in the southwest of Western Australia near the coast, in areas that are between 200 and 600 metres in altitude. It is typically found in open woodland or shrubland, but can also be found in heathland or mallee scrub. The tree is tolerant of a wide range of soils, but is also able to grow in drier areas. It is threatened by habitat loss, but can also be found growing in protected areas.

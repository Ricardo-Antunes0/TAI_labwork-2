Abdulla Qahhor (sometimes spelled Abdulla Kahhar in English) is a Somali militant leader who has been associated with al-Shabab since its establishment in 2006.  Qahhor was born in 1977 in the town of Baidoa, central Somalia. He joined al-Shabab in 2006, and rose rapidly through the organisation's ranks. In 2011, he was appointed deputy leader of al-Shabab's military operations. In September 2012, he was made leader of al-Shabab's operational branch, responsible for carrying out attacks outside of Somalia.  Qahhor is one of the most wanted terrorist suspects in the world, with a $5 million bounty on his head. He is believed to be responsible for several high-profile attacks, including the siege of the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2013 which left 67 people dead including six British nationals.

Bacteriophage P2, scientific name Escherichia virus P2, is a virus that infects Escherichia coli bacteria. It is a member of the family Poxviridae, which includes other viruses that cause bacterial infections.  Bacteriophage P2 was first identified in 1972 and has been studied extensively since its discovery because it is a good model system for studying viral infection and viral genetics. It is also a good model system for understanding the mechanisms by which viruses cause disease in host cells.  Bacteriophage P2 replicates by infecting and replicating within bacteria. Replication of bacteriophage P2 leads to the production of large quantities of phagespecific DNA, which can be used to study the biology of this virus and its relatives.

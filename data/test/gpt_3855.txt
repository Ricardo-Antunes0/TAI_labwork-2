The history of what is now Alabama began with the Mississippian culture in the eastern United States around the 11th century CE. By the 16th century, various Native American nations had established territories in what is now Alabama. The first European settlers arrived in what is now Alabama in 1540, when Pánfilo de Narváez sailed into Mobile Bay. The French established a colony in Alabama in 1699. The British briefly ruled Alabama from 1763-1765. The United States acquired the territory of Alabama from Britain in 1819.   The economy of Alabama has been based on cotton, which was cultivated throughout the state from the mid-19th century until the early 21st century. However, the production of cotton has declined since the late 20th century, and other agricultural pursuits have become more important. Manufacturing, especially automotive manufacturing, has also played an important role in the state's economy. Tourism and biomedical research are also major contributors to Alabama's economy.

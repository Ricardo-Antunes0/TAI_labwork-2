The MGM-31A Pershing was the missile used by the United States to counter the Soviet Union's SS-19 intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) threat. Designed in the early 1960s, the Pershing was deployed in large numbers from 1966 to 1989.  The Pershing was a two-stage missile with a range of about 6,000 miles (10,000 km). It was armed with a W84 nuclear warhead and was capable of striking targets across the Soviet Union. The Pershing's retirement in 1989 marked the end of the Cold War and the beginning of the collapse of the Soviet Union.

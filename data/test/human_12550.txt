Hideo Tokoro (born August 22, 1977) is a Japanese mixed martial artist who last competed in the Bantamweight division. A professional competitor since 2000, Tokoro has also formerly competed for Vale Tudo Japan, ZST, Shooto, Rings and K-1 Hero's. He is notable for holding the record for most weight divisions competed in by a professional MMA fighter, at seven, ranging from flyweight through to heavyweight. Mixed martial arts career Tokoro got his first contact with mixed martial arts in 1999, joining Kenichi Yamamoto's Power of Dream gym. He debuted in Titan Fighting Championship in 2000 and moved to multiple promotions, among them Fighting Network Rings, Shooto, ZST and K-1, the latter of which signed him up for its Hero's MMA promotion. Up to that point, as fighting wasn't enough to make a living, Tokoro had worked part-time as a janitor, an aspect which K-1 promoted heavily in order to show him as a humble, hard-working underdog figure.

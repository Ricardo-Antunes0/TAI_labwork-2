LifeLight Festival was an annual free outdoor Christian music festival held over Labor Day weekend on a farm near Worthing, South Dakota, which is 12 miles south of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. History LifeLight Festival was started by Alan and Vicki Greene in 1998 as an afternoon concert on a local church lawn, drawing about 2,000 people.  By 2001, the festival was moved to the W.H. Lyons Fairgrounds in Sioux Falls to accommodate the growing crowds.  In 2002, attendance tripled from the year before, growing to 32,000 attendees over a 3-day weekend.  LifeLight has since grown to over 320,000 attendees over a 3-day weekend, expanding to 6 stages, with a budget of nearly $700,000 each year. After outgrowing previous locations, the LifeLight festival found a new permanent home for the Festival on a family farm near Worthing, South Dakota.  The 2010 Festival was the first at the new location.  It is a free concert but provides a great economic boost to Sioux Falls. Festivals like this one said to bring up to $10 Million.  Since 2005, LifeLight has also sponsored spring and fall tours featuring LifeLight artists. They started as local tours with primarily local artists but over the years, LifeLight Tours has partnered with several national and regional bands/speakers and now travel well beyond the Midwest for tour dates.  Past tours have featured artists John Reuben, Brian Welch, Sanctus Real,  Phil Joel, Disciple, Project 86, Children 18:3 and many more and traveled to cities in Texas, Illinois, Nebraska, Colorado, Minnesota, Iowa, and South Dakota as well as other states. The 2013 festival in South Dakota hosted main showings of Plumb, Newsboys, Audio Adrenaline, and Skillet.

Film music composed by legendary playback singer Anup Ghoshal Plot This is story of a tea estate labour leader in the north eastern region of India during the British Raj. Sagina Mahato fights for the rights of the labourers and has the courage to face the tyranny of the British bosses. He is helped by a young communist Amal who comes to the place to upraise the poor and downtrodden masses. Amal, an outsider, turned Sagina as a leader and thus alienated him from the mass by elaborating, appropriating, codifying, approximating his social hierarchy. The story by Gour Kishor Ghosh (first published in Desh25:12, 18 January 1958, reveals the problems of vulgar vanguardism from the radical humanist standpoint.

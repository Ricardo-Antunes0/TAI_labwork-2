Nedda Casei (September 9, 1932 â€“ January 7, 2016) was an American molecular biologist who made important discoveries in the area of molecular genetics. She was also known for her work on gene regulation and for her contributions to the understanding of the genetic basis of disease.  Nedda Casei was born in 1932 in Brooklyn, New York. She received her undergraduate degree from Barnard College in 1952 and her PhD from Columbia University in 1957. After completing her graduate studies, Casei worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Rockefeller University before joining the faculty of the University of Michigan in 1959.  Casei's work in molecular genetics has led to significant discoveries in the area of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease. Her work on gene regulation has helped to better understand how genes are activated and turned off, leading to a better understanding of the way diseases are caused. Her work on the genetic basis of disease has helped to identify specific genes that are responsible for causing certain diseases.  Nedda Casei died on January 7, 2016 at the age of 86. She was survived by her husband, Dr. William C. Casei, and their two sons.

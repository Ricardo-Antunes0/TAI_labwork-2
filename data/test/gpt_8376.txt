An artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) is an implantable medical device used to treat certain types of male urinary incontinence. It is a metal or plastic tube that is placed under the skin of the lower abdomen, between the navel and the bladder. When the patient contracts his bladder, pressure is applied to the AUS, which helps keep urine in the bladder.  The AUS was first developed in the early 1980s as a treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED). However, it has since been used to treat a wide range of urinary disorders, including urethral stricture, overactive bladder (OAB), and voiding dysfunction associated with spinal cord injury (SCI). The AUS is also occasionally used to treat female urinary incontinence.  AUSs are manufactured by several different companies and come in a variety of sizes and shapes. They are usually implanted under local anesthesia using a small incision. AUSs can be left in place permanently or they can be removed if desired. AUSs are not currently approved for use in women.  AUSs are generally considered to be very safe devices. However, they occasionally pose some minor risks associated with their use, such as infection and device failure.

Battery Park City is a mainly residential skyscraper complex and neighborhood in the northwest corner of Lower Manhattan, New York City. The complex is bounded by West Street to the south, the Hudson River to the north, Battery Park to the east, and Washington Street to the west.  The area was originally a tidal marsh and salt marsh that extended from the southern tip of Manhattan down to the East River. In 1825, the first of a series of forts was built on the southern end of Manhattan Island (now called Battery Park), in order to protect New York City from attack from the British Navy. The fort was abandoned in 1871, and in 1875, Congress authorized the construction of a series of public buildings, including a municipal hall, a market, and a park. The area now known as Battery Park City was created in 1903 when Mayor George B. McClellan leased land from Trinity Church for 999 years, with an option to buy it back at a price fixed at $1 per year.   The development commenced with the construction of three apartment buildings: The Benjamin Franklin, The Commodore, and The Harriman. The complex was completed in 1906 and included twelve buildings: The Benjamin Franklin (1906), The Commodore (1906), The Harriman (1906), The American Express (1906), The United States Rubber Company (1910), The Singer Building (1911), Bankers Trust Tower (1912), Empire State Building (1931), 20 Wall Street (1934

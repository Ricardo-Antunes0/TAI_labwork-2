A threat actor or malicious actor is someone who intentionally or unintentionally causes harm or disruption in a system. Threat actors may be individuals, groups, or organizations. They can be motivated by a variety of reasons, such as financial gain, political gain, or revenge.  Threat actors can take many different forms and can use a variety of tools and techniques to achieve their goals. They can exploit vulnerabilities in systems or networks, spread malware, launch DDoS attacks, or hack into systems to steal data or access sensitive information. Threat actors can also use social engineering attacks to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or installing malicious software.  Threat actors can be difficult to detect and track, making it difficult to prevent them from causing damage. Organizations that are vulnerable to attack are advised to implement measures to protect themselves, such as using security software and patches, restricting access to sensitive data, and training employees on how to identify and avoid threats.

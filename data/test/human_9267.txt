He is active in Missouri politics, his two main interests being rolling back the income tax and increasing public funding for charter schools. Early life and education He had 18 cleft palate operations before age five. His father died when he was five years old. Because of the family's poverty, Sinquefield and his brother were placed in a local Catholic orphanage, the Saint Vincent Home for Children in St. Louis, Missouri. The school was run by strict German nuns who made the children sleep in big dormitories, wash the dishes, clean the rooms, and scrub the floors with steel wool. Sinquefield told the BBC that the school's regimentation taught him self-discipline. When they were teenagers, Sinquefield and his brother returned home to live with their mother, who he claims resented the city's 1% wage tax.

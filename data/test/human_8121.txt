Bojná  is a municipality in the Topoľčany District of the Nitra Region, Slovakia. The village has a population of 2013 people. The main landmark is Catholic Church of All Saints built in 1787. Opposite the church stands (since World War II defunct) synagogue, later turned community center then car repair and nowadays a bar. The village stretches about 4 km along river Bojnianka which continues through villages of Veľké Dvorany, Urmince and Chrabrany before emptying into the Nitra river, itself a tributary of the Danube. Etymology The name is derived from boj (fight, battle) preserved in all Slavic languages. Bojna or Bojnica meant place of battle, battleground (modern Slovak: bojisko) but the name could be derived also from some personal name related to boj, e.g. Bojan, Bojen. In this case, Bojná is shortening of Bojnja Ves - village of Bojen. Similar names in Slovakia are Bojnice, Bojničky, Bojanová, Bojarky and many others.

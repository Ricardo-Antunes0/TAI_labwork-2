"4% Pantomime" is a song written by Mark Hollis, and recorded by British rock band The Libertines. It was released as the third single from their third studio album, "Anthem" (2006).  The song was first performed live by the band on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge on 24 April 2006. The song was then rerecorded and released as a single in the UK on 10 June 2006.  The song is about a relationship that is in trouble. The lyrics tell the story of two lovers who have drifted apart and are no longer on the same page. 4% Pantomime reflects on the idea that everything is going to end in tears, but it's still worth fighting for.

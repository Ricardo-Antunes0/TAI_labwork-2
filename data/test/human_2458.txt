Environment Friend (foaled 19 March 1988) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire best known for his win in the 1991 running of the Eclipse Stakes, one of the United Kingdom's most important weight-for-age races. After winning the second of his races as a two-year-old he established himself as a top-class colt with a five length win in the Dante Stakes in May 1991. He ran poorly in The Derby but then defeated a strong field to win the Eclipse as a 28/1 outsider. Environment Friend never won again, but remained in training until the age of seven, and was placed in several important races including the Coronation Cup (twice), the Champion Stakes and the Irish Champion Stakes. From 1993 until 1995 his time was divided between standing as a breeding stallion and competing as a racehorse. Environment Friend died in 2012 at the age of twenty-four. Background Environment Friend was a grey horse bred by his owner, Bill Gredley, at his Stetchworth Park Stud near Newmarket, Suffolk. He was sired by the American stallion Cozzene, the winner of ten races including the Breeders' Cup Mile and the sire of several other major winners including Tikkanen, Alphabet Soup, Star of Cozzene and Star Over the Bay. Environment Friend's dam Water Woo was a Kentucky-bred daughter of the 1000 Guineas winner Waterloo. As a yearling, Environment Friend was sent to the sales but was "bought back" by his breeder for 18,000 guineas. Gredley sent the colt into training with James Fanshawe at the Pegasus House stable in Newmarket. In his first three seasons Environment Friend was usually ridden by George Duffield.

The Chadwick-Brittan House is a historic house in the London Borough of Lambeth. It is located in the Royal Borough of Greenwich, on the south side of the river Thames, close to the boundary with the London Borough of Southwark.  The Chadwick-Brittan House was built in 1771 for William Chadwick, a flour miller and MP, and his wife Sarah Brittan. It was later occupied by their son, William Chadwick, 2nd Earl of Brittan, who was Foreign Secretary in Winston Churchill's wartime coalition government.   The house is now used as offices by Lambeth Council.

Levee Town is the seventh studio album by Sonny Landreth. Released on Sugar Hill Records October 17, 2000 and re-released in an Expanded Edition on Landreth's own LandFall Records April 21, 2009. Overview Levee Town expands on the themes and musical styles exhibited on Landreth's first two major label releases Outward Bound (1992) and South of I-10 (1995).  The record shows a maturity in writing and production as well as a continuing evolution in Landreth's unique slide guitar playing. The production utilizes a mixture of arrangement styles that befits the range of musical material  - introspective singer songwriter ("Love and Glory"); bare bones 3 piece instrumentals ("Z. Rider"); “double-clutch” Zydeco grooves ("The U.S.S.  Zydecoldsmobile"); Memphis style horn arrangements ("Angeline"); swamp pop ("Soul Salvation"); a mash up of New Orleans musical textures ("Deep South"); and the exuberant bayou groove and guitar showcase of the title song ("Levee Town"). Front and center throughout is Landreth's exceptional slide guitar.

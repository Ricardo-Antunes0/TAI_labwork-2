Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 9 (CCL9) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CCL9 gene. It is a chemokine belonging to the CXC motif family. Chemokine CCL9 is mainly expressed by monocytes and macrophages, and acts as a chemoattractant for these cells.  CCL9 was initially identified as a chemokine from human blood samples that stimulated the migration of B7-H1 positive myeloid cells. The protein was later shown to also play a role in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and psoriasis. In addition, CCL9 has been shown to interact with several other proteins, including CD86 and TNF-alpha receptors.

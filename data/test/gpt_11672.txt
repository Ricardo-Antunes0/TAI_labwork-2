John of Genoa or Johannes Balbus (died c. 1248) was an Italian jurist and philosopher. He is considered one of the fathers of modern law.  John of Genoa was born in Genoa, probably in the early 12th century. After studying law at the University of Bologna, he entered the court of Pope Innocent III as a canon lawyer. In 1215 he became regent for the underage emperor Frederick II, and in 1216 guardian of the imperial palace and captain of the imperial guard. In 1221 he became a papal legate and ambassador to France. In 1227 he returned to Italy as ambassador to Sicily, and in 1230 he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Hungary.  John wrote extensively on legal, political, and philosophical subjects, but is best known for his work on the law of nations. He is credited with being the first to develop the concept of international law. His most important work, titled "De jure belli ac pacis", was published in two volumes in 1225 and 1226. The work discusses topics such as war, peace, treaties, natural law, jurisdiction, and human rights.  John died in 1248 or 1249.

In thermodynamics, the internal energy of a system is a measure of the amount of heat that has been added to or removed from the system. This quantity is often denoted U and is conventionally measured in Joules. The internal energy can be expressed in various forms, including:  U = Q + W where Q is the heat added to the system and W is the work done on the system by the external agent.

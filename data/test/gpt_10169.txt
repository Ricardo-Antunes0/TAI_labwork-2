A mechanical bull, also known as a rodeo bull, is a type of animal-powered amusement ride. It is a large, brightly colored bull that is surrounded by either a metal frame or a wooden rail and that is mounted on a set of large, round, steel wheels. Riders sit on the bull's back and are propelled along by the bull's movement.

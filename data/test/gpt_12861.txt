The Solskifte system was a land tenure system in Norway during the Middle Ages. The system was divided into three classes: bonde, skjoldeier and borgare. Bonde were the lowest class, with the right to use the land but no right to sell it. Skjoldeier were intermediate class, with the right to use the land and the right to sell it. Borgare were the highest class, with the right to own land and the right to sell it.

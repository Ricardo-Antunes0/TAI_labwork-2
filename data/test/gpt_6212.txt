Tights are a kind of cloth garment, typically of cotton or nylon, that cover the legs from the knees to the feet. They are worn as an outer garment, either as a separate item of clothing, or as an undergarment. Tights are also used as a form of body protection from the cold.  Tights may be pulled up over the toes to keep them warm, or left down to provide more ventilation. Tights are generally worn in cold weather, but may be worn in warm weather by people who want to show more skin. Tights are also worn in hot weather to avoid dehydration and heatstroke.  Originally, tights were made of woolen fabric and were used as stockings. After wool was replaced by cotton, tights became made of cotton fabric alone and were referred to as "cotton stockings". Today, tights are available in a variety of fabrics, including silk, rayon, and acetate.

Leonardo Lago Faedo (born May 13, 1960) is a former Major League Baseball shortstop. He played all or part of five seasons in the majors, from  until , for the Minnesota Twins. In 1978, he won the Tony Saladino Award, which went yearly to the top baseball player in Hillsborough County. Pro career Lenny Faedo was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the first round 16th overall in the 1978 MLB draft, two spots behind a future teammate, Tom Brunansky. Faedo was assigned to the Elizabethton Twins of the Appalachian League, where he was teammates with another player the Twins had acquired in an earlier draft, pitcher Jesse Orosco. After batting .280 in his first professional season, the Twins saw enough in Faedo that they promoted him the following season to their AA affiliate, the Orlando Twins of the Southern League. While Faedo wasn't imposing at the plate, the Twins saw enough in his fielding that in 1980, they promoted him to the club midway through the 1980 season from Orlando meaning that Faedo skipped an entire level of development and was promoted to the majors.

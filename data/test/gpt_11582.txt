The Raid on Koiari was a battle fought by the New Zealand Army in the Koiari region of north-west New Zealand, during the Second World War. The battle was fought from 18 to 20 January 1943.  The raid was part of the larger Operation Creswell campaign, which aimed to clear the way for an Allied advance up the eastern coast of New Zealand. The aim of the operation was to recapture the town of Koiari, which had been seized by the Japanese two months earlier.  The battle began with an attack by armoured vehicles supported by artillery and mortars. The Japanese defenders put up a stiff resistance and the battle continued into the night. By the end of the day, however, the Allies had control of most of the town and had suffered casualties estimated at around 100 dead and 400 wounded.

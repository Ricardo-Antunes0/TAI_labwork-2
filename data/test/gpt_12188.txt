He was educated first at private schools in Cheltenham and then at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he read classics and mathematics.  In 1869 Copinger became a student of Egyptology at the British Museum under William Matthew Flinders Petrie. He became assistant curator of antiquities in 1881 and director of excavations in Egypt in 1894. In 1898 he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.  Copinger died in 1907 at his home in Grosvenor Square, London.  Walter Arthur Copinger is most noted for his work on Ancient Egyptian tombs and monuments. He excavated extensively at Thebes, Memphis, Abydos and other sites during the late 1800s. His most important discoveries include the tomb of Tutankhamun (1883), which is now exhibited at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo; the partially restored tomb of Khendjer (1889), now also in the Egyptian Museum; and the tomb of Ay (1901), now located at Saqqara.

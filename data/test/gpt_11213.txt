Intarabus was a Gaulish god in the pantheon of the Gallic people.  The name Intarabus is attested from the 3rd century BC, when it was used to translate the name of the Anatolian god Inti. The Gaulish god may have been related to the Roman god Jupiter, with whom he shares some common features. He was probably a war god, as indicated by his epithet "bellator".  Intarabus was also known as Tarabus, which is a Gaulish adaptation of the Latin name Tarvus. This name may be connected to the root tar-, meaning "to rage", and may indicate that Intarabus was associated with war and bloodshed.

Zagava, initially established as Antiquariat Bücherwelten in 2002, is a German imprint from Düsseldorf that publishes genre-defying literature with an emphasis on weird fiction, strange tales and novels, supernatural and horror literature in limited editions. Although based in Germany all of Zagava′s books are in the English language. Most of Zagava's books are issued in standard limited and numbered hardbound versions and frequently in additional special lettered subeditions with special bindings or additional extras. The books are as much about their contents as about the art of fine book-production. Jonas Ploeger is the proprietor of this press.

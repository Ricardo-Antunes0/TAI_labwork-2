Fabiola Terzi is an Italian-French scientist and engineer who has made significant contributions to the field of artificial intelligence.  Fabiola Terzi was born in Palermo, Sicily, on December 2, 1952. She received her undergraduate degree in physics from the University of Palermo in 1974 and her doctorate in engineering from the University of Paris in 1982.  Terzi worked as a research scientist at CNRS and INRIA before joining the University of Edinburgh as a professor of artificial intelligence in 1998. She has been a visiting professor at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, the University of California at Berkeley, and the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden.  Terzi is best known for her work in natural language processing and machine learning. Her book, Corpus-Based Approaches to Machine Learning (MIT Press, 1998), is one of the seminal texts in this field. Her more recent books include Understanding Natural Language (Cambridge University Press, 2003), which deals with statistical machine learning and its applications to natural language processing, and Machine Learning: A Comprehensive Foundation (Second Edition, Springer, 2009), which presents a comprehensive overview of machine learning methods from a theoretical perspective.  Terzi has also made significant contributions to the field of artificial intelligence. She is responsible for founding two major research groups in this area: the Edinburgh Group for Artificial Intelligence (EGAI) and the Paris Group for Artificial Intelligence (PGAI). EGAI has developed several landmark algorithms, including an early

In common law legal systems, laches (from Ancient Greek λάχη "sleep, slumber") generally refers to a defense of delay in asserting one's right, as contrasted with prosecution of that right.   Laches may excuse a party from asserting a right if the party can demonstrate that they were unaware of the right at the time they should have been aware and did not act in bad faith in asserting the right later. In some jurisdictions, including the United States, equitable laches may also be used to excuse a party from performance where it would be inequitable to hold them accountable in light of intervening events.

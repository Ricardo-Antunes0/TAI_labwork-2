Petoskey High School is a high school located in Petoskey, Michigan. Petoskey High School offers a complementary mix of academic, athletic and leadership opportunities for enrolled students. The alternative public high school in Petoskey is Concord Academy, a Kâ€“12 public charter school focused on integration between the arts and academics. History  The original building of Petoskey High School was completed in 1914 at the southeast corner of State and Howard Streets in downtown Petoskey. In 1930, the building today known as Central Elementary was added to the high school building as a junior high. In 1966, the current Petoskey High School building was constructed due to extreme overcrowding at the former building, which had since become the junior high school building. In 1991, the junior high (now middle school) moved out of the older building and into a new one near the current high school. In 1999, the old high school building was demolished, leaving Central Elementary in the current location.

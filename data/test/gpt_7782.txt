Marco Kartodikromo (1890 – 18 March 1932), also known as Marco Karteropoulo, was a Greek painter who specialized in portraits. He was one of the most significant representatives of post-World War I Greek painting.  Born and raised in Athens, Kartodikromo studied at the Athens School of Fine Arts before moving to Paris in 1912. There, he came into contact with the Post-Impressionists and became influenced by their work. He returned to Greece in 1916 and continued to paint portraits until his death in 1932. Kartodikromo is best known for his portraits of Aristotelis Zappas, George Katzeris, and Konstantinos Roilos.

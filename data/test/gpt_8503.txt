The evolution of cetaceans is thought to have begun with aquatic mammals that evolved from early land-mammals during the Paleocene epoch. Following the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, cetaceans diversified and began to migrate into various ocean environments. During the Miocene epoch, cetaceans became widespread and developed a range of different body shapes and sizes. The Pleistocene epoch saw the extinction of many cetacean lineages, but saw the rise of modern cetaceans. Cetaceans have undergone numerous adaptations over the course of their evolution, including changes in skull shape, swimming ability, and dental structure.

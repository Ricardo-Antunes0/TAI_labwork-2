Deborah Sinclair is a Canadian social worker who has specialized in working with women who are victims of intimate partner violence.  She served as an expert witness in court cases where intimate partner violence has played a role.  She has been working with victims of violence for over thirty years. In 1985, the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services published a 185-page manual Sinclair wrote, entitled Understanding Wife Assault A Training Manual for Counsellors and Advocates.  Lois Mitchell quotes Sinclair's book in the Baptist Atlantic: "Two-fifths of all homicides in Canada are between spouses. The vast majority of the victims are women.Those women who do kill their partners are usually acting in self-defence."  Transition House, a shelter in Newfoundland, quotes Sinclair's definition of abuse on its home page.  In her 1998 book Search for a Safe Place, Vijay Agnew notes Sinclair's book does not address the complications of abuse in minority communities from different cultures.

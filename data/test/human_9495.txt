The Ridgewood Historic District is a residential neighborhood in Canton, Ohio.  The neighborhood consists of preserved, architect-designed Revival style buildings built in the early 20th century with amenities such as original brick streets and locally produced street lighting standards.  The District features homes designed by several distinguished architects, including Charles Firestone, Herman Albrecht, and Louis Hoicowitz.  Due to its historic architectural significance, the District was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on December 19, 1982. Description  The Ridgewood Historic District is an area of residential buildings extending east and west of Market Avenue North, a major north-south artery, in the City of Canton approximately 20 blocks from the center of town.  A series of three contiguous allotments, the District was developed by George A. (Jake) Leonard and the Leonard Agency between 1918 and 1940, with the majority of its significant buildings having been erected in the decade 1920 to 1930. The name of Ridgewood is attributed to Mrs. Leonard, who was quite taken with an allotment which she had visited in Springfield, Ohio, called "Ridgewood."  Of the 190 buildings in the District, 58 Post World War II buildings provide background. There are no intrusions.

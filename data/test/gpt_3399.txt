Adrian, also spelled Hadrian (born before 637, died 727 or 735), was the last Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury and one of the most important ecclesiastical figures of his age.  As the religious leader of a nation that was coming to terms with its Christian heritage, Adrian played an important role in the development of Anglo-Saxon England. He was also a proponent of learning and scholarship, and helped to establish a number of monastic institutions.  Adrian was a prolific writer, both in Latin and in English. His works include a biography of Christ and several treatises on theology. He is also credited with the creation of the Easter liturgy, which is still used today by the Catholic Church.

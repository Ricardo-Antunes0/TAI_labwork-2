The Winchuck River (Tolowa: duu-sr-xuu-shi taa-ghin-li~') is a tributary of the Klamath River in northeastern California.  The Winchuck River rises in the Oregonian highlands, southeast of Mount Shasta, and flows generally southeastward into the Klamath River, near the small town of Klamath Falls. The river is dammed by the Lower Klamath Dam for hydroelectric power generation and recreation purposes. Downstream from the dam, the river is impounded by the Upper Klamath Dam for irrigation and timber production.   The Lower Winchuck River is a popular whitewater rafting destination, with Class III and IV rapids. The Upper Winchuck is also popular for fishing, including steelhead and salmon.

The Sinclair Sovereign was a high-end calculator produced by Sinclair Research Ltd from 1978 to 1979. It was the successor to Sinclair's earlier Sinclair ZX-80 and ZX-81 models, and was aimed at the scientific, engineering and mathematical (STEM) market.  The Sinclair Sovereign was a more powerful and sophisticated model than its predecessors. It had a faster processor, more memory and a larger display than the ZX-80. The Sovereign also featured a built-in keyboard, a feature not found on the earlier models.  The Sovereign was released in two versions: the standard model and the Plus model. The Plus model had additional features such as a built-in printer and an extra 64 KB of memory.  The Sinclair Sovereign was unsuccessful commercially, partly due to its high price tag of £1,295 (equivalent to £ in ). However, it has been retrospectively praised for its technical innovation and for its contributions to the development of the computer industry.

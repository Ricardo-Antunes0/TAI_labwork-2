Fides quaerens intellectum means "faith seeking understanding" or "faith seeking knowledge." The phrase is attributed to Augustine of Hippo, and it encapsulates the Christian doctrine of faith seeking understanding or knowledge.   The phrase is used in the context of theological discussions about whether faith can lead to understanding or knowledge. Augustine argued that faith cannot lead to understanding because it is based on hope, whereas understanding is based on knowledge.

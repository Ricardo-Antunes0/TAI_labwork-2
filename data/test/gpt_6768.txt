Indo-Scythians (also called Indo-Sakas) were a group of pastoral nomads who inhabited the northern areas of the Indian Subcontinent from the 1st century BC to the 4th century AD. They are thought to have been related to the Scythians, and were possibly a branch of that people.  The Indo-Scythians are first mentioned in Greek sources during the 1st century BC, when they were known to have fought alongside the Seleucids against Ptolemy I Philadelphus in the Battle of Panium. The first Indo-Scythian kingdom appears to have been established in northern Punjab around 100 BC by a king called Sagarashva or Sagarakshvara. The kingdom expanded into northwestern India and southward towards the Ganges River by about 50 BC. There is some evidence of relations with the Parthian Empire in southern India in the 2nd century BC. The Indo-Scythians lost their kingdom in 185 BC to the conquering Ptolemaic Kingdom.  The first important reference to the Indo-Scythians comes from Chinese sources during the 1st century BC, which describes them as being close kin to the Scythians and living near Bactria and Sogdiana. Later references also suggest that they migrated westwards and southwards along with other nomadic peoples after the collapse of the Satavahana Empire. The Indo-Scythians are thought to have reached what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan by about 150

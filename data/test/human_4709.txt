The Mount Shasta Wilderness is a  federally designated wilderness area located  east  of Mount Shasta City in northern California. The US Congress passed the 1984 California Wilderness Act that set aside the Mount Shasta Wilderness. The US Forest Service is the managing agency  as the wilderness  is within the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The area is named for and is dominated by the Mount Shasta volcano which reaches a traditionally quoted height of  above sea level, but official sources give values ranging from  from one USGS project, to  via the NOAA.  Mount Shasta is one of only two peaks in the state over  outside the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. The other summit is White Mountain Peak in the Great Basin of east-central California. The Wintun Glacier is located on Mount Shasta and is the lowest-elevation glacier in the state, lying at  elevation and extending to the summit.

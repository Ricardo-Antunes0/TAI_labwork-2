Interdependence theory is a social exchange theory that emphasizes the importance of social relationships in shaping individual behavior. The theory is based on the premise that individuals are influenced by the actions and attitudes of others, and that the strength and durability of social relationships is a key determinant of individual well-being.  The theory has been used to explain a wide variety of phenomena, including social mobility, crime, altruism, and conflict. Interdependence theory has also been used to develop new insights into areas such as social capital, team work, and collective action.  Interdependence theory has been influential in the fields of sociology, psychology, economics, and political science.

Countdown is a British game show involving word and number tasks. It is broadcast on Channel 4 and currently presented by Anne Robinson, assisted by Anne-Marie Imafidon, with resident lexicographer Susie Dent. It was the first programme to be aired on Channel 4, and 83 series have been broadcast since its debut on 2 November 1982. With over 7,000 episodes, Countdown is one of the longest-running game shows in the world, along with the original French version, Des chiffres et des lettres (Numbers & Letters), which has been running on French television continuously since 1965. Countdown was initially recorded at The Leeds Studios for 27 years, before moving to Manchester-based Granada Studios in 2009. Following the development of MediaCityUK, Countdown moved again in 2013 to the new purpose-built studios at Dock10, Greater Manchester. The programme was presented by Richard Whiteley for almost 23 years, until his death in June 2005. It was then presented by Des Lynam until the end of 2006, Des O'Connor until the end of 2008, Jeff Stelling until the end of 2011 and Nick Hewer until mid 2021, with Colin Murray standing in for Hewer during part of the COVID-19 pandemic. The series has been presented by Anne Robinson, its first female presenter, since the beginning of series 84 in 2021.

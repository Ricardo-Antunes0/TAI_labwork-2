Cantal cheese is an uncooked firm cheese produced in the Auvergne region of central France: more particularly in the département of Cantal (named after the Cantal mountains) as well as in certain adjoining districts. Cantal cheese was granted Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée certification in 1956. One of the oldest cheeses in France, Cantal dates back to the times of the Gauls. It came to prominence when Marshal Henri de La Ferté-Senneterre served it at the table of Louis XIV of France. Senneterre is also responsible for the introduction of Saint-Nectaire and Salers. Composition There are two types of Cantal cheese: Cantal Fermier, a farmhouse cheese made from raw milk; and Cantal Laitier, a commercial, mass-produced version made from pasteurized milk. Both have to adhere to the same strict quality controls. The cheese is made only using milk from hay-fed Salers cows, and is only harvested from November 15 to April 15. The summer milk of the same cows grazing on mountain meadows makes the Salers cheese.

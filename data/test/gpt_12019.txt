John Barbour (c.1320 â€“ 13 March 1395) was a Scottish poet and courtier. He is best known for his lyric poems, including The Bruce, The Ballad of Chevy Chase and The Wallace.  John Barbour was born in about 1320, the son of a minor nobleman. He began his career as a soldier and then followed the court of King David II of Scotland, where he became an informal secretary to the king. Barbour's poetic skills were first recognised in 1347, when he wrote a love poem to Jean de Dunbar. He rose to become one of the most important poets in Scotland, and served as royal bard from 1364 to 1385.  John Barbour died in about 1395. His work has been praised for its simplicity and elegance, and has been compared to that of Geoffrey Chaucer.

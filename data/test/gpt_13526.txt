Inocybe saliceticola is a fungus found in temperate and subarctic Europe, North America, and Asia. The fungus is found growing on the dead wood of various deciduous trees and shrubs, most notably poplar, aspen, birch, alder, willow, and apple.  The fungus is distinguished from other Inocybes by the presence of large numbers of small conical volva-like structures on the surface of its fruit bodies. The fungus is considered to be poisonous, and has been reported to cause nausea and vomiting in humans.

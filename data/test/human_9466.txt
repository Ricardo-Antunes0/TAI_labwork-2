The Choice Lab is a research group at the Department of Economics, at the Norwegian School of Economics. In order to better understand economic and moral choices, The Choice Lab designs experiments that are implemented in controlled laboratory or field settings. The research group consists of researchers devoted to learning more about how people make economic and moral choices, and how governments, corporations and non-governmental institutions can use insights from this research to improve their decision making. Research topics  The research in The Choice Lab follows three distinct avenues. First, using economic experiments, the researchers study individual decision making, including how people are motivated by moral, risk, time, and institutional considerations. This research includes laboratory experiments with students, representative populations, criminals, and children, conducted in different parts of the world. The research group has also been involved in large scale internet experiments, field experiments, and surveys. Second, the research group studies implications of their experimental findings for important policy issues, including global income inequality, tax policy, and health care, and for management issues relevant to corporations and non-governmental organizations. Third, the research group studies, through axiomatic analysis, the normative justifications for different theories of justice, and how these theories relate to welfare, inequality and poverty measurement issues.

A firewall is a system or group of systems used to protect computers, networks, and other digital resources from unauthorized access by users. A firewall system can be physical or virtual, and it can be used at the perimeter of a network, or inside the network.  A distributed firewall is a type of firewall system that is implemented in a distributed manner. Distributed firewalls are sometimes also referred to as content-based firewalls, application-based firewalls, or network-based firewalls. A distributed firewall system is made up of a collection ofFirewall nodes (or "firewall nodesets") that are interconnected by a firewall network.  A distributed firewall system allows for the deployment of a larger firewall solution than would be possible with a single Firewall node. This is important because it enables the deployment of more robust and advanced firewalls on smaller systems, without the need for increased hardware resources. Additionally, distributed firewalls can scale to handle larger numbers of concurrent connections and traffic flows than can be handled by a single Firewall node.  Distributed firewalls are also advantageous in that they can be deployed in a decentralized fashion. This means that the Firewall nodesets do not have to be located in the same physical location, which can reduce the risk of cyberattacks that target specific parts of the network.

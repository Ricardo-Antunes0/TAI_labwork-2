Auditory verbal agnosia (AVA), also known as auditory word blindness, is a disorder in which a person has difficulty understanding or recognizing words heard verbally. The disorder can be caused by damage to the hearing nerve or the brain itself. Symptoms typically start gradually and may worsen over time. AVA may be mild or severe, and can impact one or both ears.  AVA is a type of auditory processing disorder (APD), which is a group of conditions that affect the way people hear and understand spoken words. APDs can cause problems with both listening and speaking. People with AVA typically have difficulty understanding words even when they are pronounced clearly. They may also have difficulty recognizing individual words or groups of words, even when they are presented in front of them.  There is no one-size-fits-all approach to treating AVA, as the condition can vary significantly from person to person. Some people with AVA may need special accommodations while attending school or work, while others may only need support in daily life. Some people with AVA may also require speech therapy to help them learn how to better pronounce words.

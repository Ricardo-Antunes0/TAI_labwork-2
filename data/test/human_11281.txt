Azadveh-i Banegan Mahan-i Mihr-Bondad, known in Arabic sources as Azadhbih ibn Baniyan Mahan ibn Mihrbundadh, better simply known as Azadbeh, was an Iranian nobleman, who served as the Sasanian marzban of al-Hira in the period 617-633. Biography  Azadbeh was born in Hamadan in the province of Media to a family of dehqan origin. In 617 or 618, he was appointed as the governor of al-Hira, thus succeeding the Iranian noble Nakhiragan and the Arab Iyas ibn Qabisah al-Ta'i, who together had co-governed al-Hira after the execution of the last Lakhmid ruler al-Nu'man III in 602. During his governorship, Azadbeh managed to secure his position by giving his daughter in marriage to the lord of Sinnin, who was of higher rank than him. Al-Taberi cites an older source that Azadbeh ruled for 17 years, which suggests that he was appointed as governor in 617 rather than 618, but there are some uncertainty about the chronology.

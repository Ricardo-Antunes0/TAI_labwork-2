SG Gesundbrunnen Berlin was a short-lived postwar sports stadium in Berlin, Germany. It was located in the Gesundbrunnen district, on the north side of the Spree river.  The stadium was built between 1949 and 1951 as part of the British occupation zone, and initially served as the home ground of Tennis Borussia Berlin. It was also used for football matches, among others by Hertha BSC. In 1952, it became the home ground of the Berliner Sport-Club (BSC), which had been displaced from its former home ground at Olympiastadion by the construction of the Berlin Wall. The stadium held up to 30,000 spectators.  The stadium closed in 1971 due to safety concerns, after a series of fatal accidents had taken place there. The site was redeveloped for housing.

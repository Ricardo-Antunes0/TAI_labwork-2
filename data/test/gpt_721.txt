The painted stork (Mycteria leucocephala) is a large stork in the family Ardeidae. It is found in southern and central Africa, from the Cape Verde Islands and West Africa through much of South Africa to eastern Zambia and Zimbabwe.   The painted stork is a large, long-legged bird with a broad, slightly upturned beak. The upperparts are a deep rich brown, the head and neck are black, and the underparts are white. The wings and tail are largely black, with a brilliant yellow stripe down the centre of each feather. The male has a red face and neck, while the female is mostly white with some brown markings. The juvenile is similar to the female, but has more brown on the head and less yellow on the wings and tail.  The painted stork feeds on large insects, particularly grasshoppers, and also takes small birds, lizards, frogs and snakes. It nests on cliffs or in trees, constructing a bulky stick nest measuring up to 2 m tall and 1.5 m across. Two or three eggs are laid.

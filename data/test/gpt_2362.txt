The theory of causal fermion systems is a branch of theoretical physics that is concerned with the description of systems in which fermions (matter particles with half-integer spin) are interacting with each other. In such systems, the behavior of individual fermions is governed by the so-called Fermi–Dirac statistics, which describes how the probability of a particular particle occupying any given state in space and time changes with the position and momentum of other particles in the system.  The theory has been applied to a wide range of phenomena, including the behavior of Bose–Einstein condensates, superconductors, and electronic materials. It has also found applications in fields such as cosmology and quantum field theory.

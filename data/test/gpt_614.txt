(in Medieval Latin, corresponding to Old English þeodisc, þeodiscus; from Proto-Germanic *þeudisc, from *þeudō, to give)  Theodiscus (; fl. 1st century AD) was a Latin author of a treatise on the theory of music, the earliest surviving work on the subject. He is considered one of the fathers of Western classical music theory.  Theodiscus was born in Rome probably in the 1st century AD. He was a pupil of Musaeus and flourished during the reigns of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius. The extant work, De Musica, is divided into three books. Book I treats rhythm, Book II melody, and Book III harmony. The treatise has been influential in the development of classical music theory and remains an important source for understanding the principles of counterpoint and polyphony.

Erecura or Aerecura  (also found as Aerecura) is a genus of passerine birds in the Old World warbler family.  The genus comprises six species, all of which are found in Europe. Two of the six species, the Hume's warbler and the green-backed warbler, are considered to be threatened with extinction.   The genus was first described by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1816. The name "Aerecura" is derived from the Ancient Greek word "aere," meaning 'air,' and "kurÄ“," meaning 'a bird.'

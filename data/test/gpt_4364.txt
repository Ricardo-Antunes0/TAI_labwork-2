Panic selling is a wide-scale selling of assets or stock in the hope of profiting from the subsequent fall in prices. The practice is often associated with market crashes, typically occurring after major news events.  The term "panic selling" was first used in the 1930s during the Great Depression to describe how investors sold stocks and other assets after widespread fears of a stock market crash. In recent decades, panic selling has been observed during events such as the dotcom bubble, September 11th terrorist attacks, and the global financial crisis of 2008-09.  The primary drivers of panic selling are psychological factors such as fear of missing out (FOMO) and herd behavior. Other factors that may contribute to panic selling include information overload and irrationality. Panic sellers may also sell assets because they have low confidence in their investment or because they believe the market is overvalued.

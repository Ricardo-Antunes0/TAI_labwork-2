Shao Kahn is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. He is the primary villain and final boss of the first game in the series, Mortal Kombat.  Shao Kahn is a towering and imposing figure, with a long, gangly frame and a beard that covers most of his chest and extends down to his waist. He wears a long, black robe with red trim, and he carries a staff topped with an eagle's head. His appearance is based on the Chinese deity Fu Xi, the god of wisdom and war.  Shao Kahn is one of the oldest and most powerful beings in the Mortal Kombat world. He was once a god-like being known as The Great Kung Lao, but he was banished from the Earthrealm for plotting to overthrow its emperor, Shao Kahn. In order to return to Earthrealm and take over as its ruler, Shao Kahn enslaves Earth's warriors and pits them against each other in tournaments in order to gain their power.  Shao Kahn is one of the few characters in the Mortal Kombat series who has appeared in every game in the series. He has also appeared in various spin-off games and comics. In 2011, he was ranked as the eighteenth best video game villain by IGN.

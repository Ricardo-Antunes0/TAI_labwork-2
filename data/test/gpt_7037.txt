The forewings are light grey, with a dark fuscous blotch occupying the basal fourth and reaching nearly half across the wing, preceded by a smaller light yellowish blotch on the costa at one-third, and followed by a small yellowish spot on the costa before the middle, as well as a suffused light yellowish streak from three-fourths of the costa towards the apex, both edged anteriorly with dark fuscous. There is a small dark fuscous spot on the dorsum at one-fourth and an elongate cloudy white mark on the costa at two-thirds, as well as an undefined cloudy white spot near the termen. The hindwings are whitish grey.

In 1969, George Clinton formed Parliament-Funkadelic with members of the R&B vocal group The Parliaments. The group's name was a combination of the two biggest funk labels at the time: Atco Records (where P-Funk's first single had been released) and Funkadelic Records (where The Parliaments had recorded). Clinton chose the name because it was one letter away from his previous group, P-Funk All Stars.  Clinton originally envisioned Parliament-Funkadelic as a one-off project, but the group's success led to multiple recordings and tours.

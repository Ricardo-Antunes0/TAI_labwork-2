Chošnau is continuously named as one of the most played and most performing artists of Lithuania. Biography Chošnau was born to a Lithuanian mother and Iraqi Kurdish father in Vilnius, Lithuania. The family—Chošnau with his parents and sister Greta—lived in Baghdad, Iraq until Chošnau's mother died in 1983. The 8-year-old Chošnau returned to Lithuania and was raised by his grandparents. However, his then teenaged sister was left in Baghdad with their father. Thus Chošnau grew up speaking the Arabic language and only later learned the Lithuanian language. Tragic family split was not enough for the destiny. The long lasting Iraq–Iran war separated Chošnau from his father and sister for a long time.

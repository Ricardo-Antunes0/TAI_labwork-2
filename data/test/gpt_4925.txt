In role based access control, the role hierarchy is a model of organizing access rights to objects and resources in an organization. It is used in situations where the organization has a large number of objects or resources, where it is not feasible or practical to give each user complete rights to all objects and resources, and where it is desirable to allow users to access objects and resources based on their assigned roles.  The role hierarchy is a model of organizing access rights to objects and resources in an organization. It consists of a series of roles, each of which has privileges assigned to it. Users are assigned to one or more roles, and their privileges are determined by their role in the hierarchy.  The role hierarchy is most often used in situations where the organization has a large number of objects or resources, where it is not feasible or practical to give each user complete rights to all objects and resources, and where it is desirable to allow users to access objects and resources based on their assigned roles. The role hierarchy can be used in conjunction with other security models, such as passwords and authentication schemes, to provide an effective security solution for an organization.

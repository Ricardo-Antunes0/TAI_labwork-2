Chul is a thick horse-cover from wool material that covers the horse to sit on top to protect yourself from cold weather. The covers are mostly rusty, rarely touched by pile technique. In addition, both pile and non-woven weave (also known as "mysterious" tissue technique) are also available. One of these rods is the Chulaian example of the Shirvan group, preserved in the Azerbaijan Carpet Museum and dating back to the late 19th century. Unique with its rich ornament and color harmony, this unique feature draws attention to its uniqueness. The composition consists of intermediate and three edges, and it is decorated with a geometric element, stylized butterfly and bird drawings. On the border there is the sign "flow water" representing the infinity and protection of the S-shaped hinge motifs. In the center section, the "combs" element, which is described in consistency, means being protected from scams. Generally, such elements can be found in many carpet products. The element "PÄ±traq", which means abundance and blessing, is also considered to be one of the main ornaments hanging on chulpe. Flower elements decorating borders symbolize divine love and longing. Shelles were widely used in special gatherings and banquets to protect the animal (horses, camels, oxen) or to protect the animal in cold weather. At the touch of wool, cotton, and sometimes silk threads, the weaving knives woven themselves and decorated them with various ornaments. The rectangular shape of the wick rope was wounded with fringed skulls.

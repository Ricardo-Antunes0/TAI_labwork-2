Martin Douglas Wallin (July 30, 1919 â€“ March 15, 2000) was a ballad singer and fiddler born in Madison County, North Carolina, and a recipient of a 1989 North Carolina Heritage Award. Biography A member of the Wallin Family, Wallin's parents, father Lee and mother Berzilla, were singers; Lee also played the fiddle and banjo and Doug's younger brother Jack plays banjo, fiddle, and guitar. His song selection and style respectfully reflected the Wallins' long family heritage. His singing was unusually refined, characteristically rendered with subtlety, precision, and a silent passion. His extensive repertoire was made up of centuries-old ballads and songs, many of which were of British ancestry, which he learned from members of his family and the mountain community he grew up in; he particularly favored love ballads, which he sang without instrumental accompaniment. Wallin often played the tune of a ballad on the fiddle before singing the words, or added a fiddled refrain between verses. Like his singing, his fiddling was straightforward and traditional, emphasizing the simple beauty of each song's melody.

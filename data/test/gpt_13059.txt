The Nye Initiative (or "Nye Report" or "Nye Report on Energy and the Economy") is a libertarian think tank proposal for the United States of America that would end the use of all fossil fuels within a decade, and transition to renewable energy.  The Nye Initiative was proposed by economist and TV personality Bill Nye in a paper submitted to the U.S. Congress in early 2017. The proposal calls for the United States to cease all use of fossil fuels within 10 years, and transitions to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, and tidal power. The goal of the Nye Initiative is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% below 1990 levels by 2050, while also creating 25 million new jobs in the process.  The Nye Initiative has been met with criticism from both sides of the political aisle. Some conservatives argue that ending the use of fossil fuels would be economically harmful, while others believe that transitioning to renewable energy is a necessary step in mitigating climate change.

The Bullock-Clifton House is a historic home located in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. It is a large, three-story brick and stone structure with a hipped roof and a Palladian portico. The house was built in 1828 for Nathaniel Clifton, one of the signers of the United States Constitution. It was later acquired by Senator John C. Bullock and his wife, Sarah Tennessee Clifton. The Bullock family used the house as their country home until 1933, when it was sold to the government to become the Office of Foreign Assets Control headquarters. The building remained in government ownership until it was sold to the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1985.   The Bullock-Clifton House is a well-preserved example of early Federal architecture, and it has been designated a National Historic Landmark. It is open to the public for tours during regular business hours.

Brainclaw is an industrial/electronic music project initially conceived as a collaboration between James Ferraro and Nathan Ward. The project was initially conceived as a way to explore Ferraro's burgeoning interest in industrial and electronic music composition, while also providing Ward with an opportunity to explore his own creative impulses within these genres.  Since its inception, Brainclaw has released two full-length albums, "Liminal" (2013) and "Transcending" (2015), as well as several EPs and singles. The project has received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising its dark and brooding sound, its experimental nature, and Ferraro's expert production skills.  Brainclaw is currently signed to Dark Descent Records, and is set to release its third full-length album, "Ruin", in early 2019.

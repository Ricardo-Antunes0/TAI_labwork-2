Psychic bid (also psych, pronounced to rhyme with "skeech") is a form of bidding in contract bridge. A player who has two or more tricks (and is not declarer) may, after the auction, ask the other players to make a "psychic bid" (a bid in which the bidder believes that the partnership can make a contract with at least one card in the dummy) equal to the number of tricks they hold.  This system was first used by Boris Schapiro in the 1955 World Team Championship. It was also used by Tony Trabue in his 1959 world championship match against Bill Cunningham.

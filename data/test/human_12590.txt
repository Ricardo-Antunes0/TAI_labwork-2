Promises! Promises! (presented as Promises... Promises! on screen) is a 1963 American sex comedy film directed by King Donovan and starring Tommy Noonan and Jayne Mansfield, the former of whom also produced the film. Released toward the end of the Hays code's existence and before the MPAA film rating system became effective, it was the first Hollywood motion picture release of the sound era to feature a mainstream star (Mansfield) in the nude, though had the unfinished Something's Got to Give, which starred Marilyn Monroe, been released in 1962 as planned, it would have been entitled to claim that distinction. Plot Sandy Brooks (Mansfield) is desperate to get pregnant, but her husband Jeff (Tommy Noonan), a television script writer, is too stressed out to make love to her. In an attempt at a sea change, they go on a pleasure cruise and meet another couple, Claire and King Banner (Marie McDonald and Mickey Hargitay). Both couples set out on a drunken spree. They end up changing partners when retiring to their rooms. Later both women discover that they are pregnant, and set out to find whether the fathers are their own or the other's husband.

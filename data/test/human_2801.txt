GoMedia is a British company which supplies a management system which delivers entertainment packages including featuring films to travelers on trains and coaches including on Eurostar trains. The system also gives real-time travel information. Rather than using a monitor on the seat in front of the passenger, it uses the passenger's own device ("Bring Your Own Device" or BYOD) such as mobiles and tablets. It uses the vehicle's own Wi-Fi rather than the passenger's independent mobile network for on-board infotainment. Their BEAM management system is the first app of its kind in the UK, and is used across Virgin West Coast and East Coast. The films available include Independence Day: Resurgence, which formed the foundation of Virgin Trainsâ€™ BEAM launch at Euston Station, London in late 2016. TV box sets from BBC Worldwide, cartoons, games, digital newspapers and magazines are also offered.  The free on-demand entertainment provided includes films, catch-up TV, box sets, cartoons, games, newspapers and magazines. A tracker app also shows the train's exact location. GoMedia has its own encoding and offline DRM service offering.

Khilkoff or Khilkov  is a Rurikid princely family that originated in the Kuban region of the Russian Empire.  The Khilkoff family traces its ancestry to the late medieval principality of Ryazan, which was annexed by Muscovy in the 15th century. One of the family's early members was Prince Dmitry Ivanovich Khilkoff, who played an important role in Moscow's defense during the Time of Troubles.   The Khilkoff family played a prominent role in Russian politics throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. Several members served as ministers or governors of various provinces and territories under the Tsars and later the Russian Empire. The most famous member of the family was Count Pavel Ivanovich Khilkoff, who served as Minister of Finance under four Tsars (Alexander I, Nicholas I, Alexander II, and Nicholas II) and played a key role in Russian economic development.

The Māori  are the indigenous Polynesian people of New Zealand. According to the 2006 census, there were 1,496,000 Māori in New Zealand, accounting for around 2.5 percent of the population. The Māori language is the traditional language of the Māori people and is spoken by around 260,000 people.  The Māori people are descended from early Polynesian settlers who first arrived in New Zealand about 1250 AD. They developed a distinctive culture that is now largely preserved through customary law, music and art. The Māori economy is largely based on farming and tourism.  The main areas where the Māori people live are the North Island and the South Island. There are also significant populations in Aotearoa (New Zealand), Australia and the United States.

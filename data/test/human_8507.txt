Etna is a fictional character who appears in the Disgaea series of video games. First appearing as one of the main characters in the series's first entry, Disgaea: Hour of Darkness in 2003, she has appeared in most subsequent entries in either lead or supporting roles, and had many cameo appearances across other Nippon Ichi Software video games. Concept and creation Disgaea artist Takehito Harada described her as a "scheming, disrespectful sidekick." He stated, "I represented Etna's personality by the unbalance between her youthful body style and her sexy outfit. The producers told me to create her as a spiteful attendant, and it was pretty easy. Other than her details, the initial design has not changed." NIS America PR and marketing manager Nao Zook felt that Etna and the Prinnies are among the "standouts" of Cross Edge. Zook also cited Etna as among his favourite characters in the crossover game Trinity Universe.

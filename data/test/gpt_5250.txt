The numéraire (or numeraire) is a basic unit of currency in many countries. It is also used as a unit of account, for example in banking and finance. The numéraire is derived from the Latin word numero, meaning 'number'.  The modern numéraire system is typically divided into two main types: the decimal system and the fractional system. In the decimal system, numbers are represented by digits, with the position of a number in a sequence representing its magnitude (or size). In the fractional system, numbers are represented by fractions with a denominator that is not a whole number (e.g. 1/10).

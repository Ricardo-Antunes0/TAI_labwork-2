Arash Rahmanipour ( c. 1990-January 28, 2010) was one of the two people hanged in early 2010 by the Iranian government after being convicted of waging war against God (Moharebeh) and attempting to overthrow the Islamic regime.  Some government-controlled media outlets had originally alleged that one of the reasons behind Arash Rahmanipour's execution was for participation in post-election protests, trying to associate him with Iranian Green Movement, in what has been called by some analysts "an attempt to intimidate a widespread protest movement challenging the nation's hard-line establishment", despite the fact that Rahmanipour was arrested months before the 2009 presidential elections and was in jail during the post-election protests. Accusations and execution The regime has claimed that the two were members of a political group "the Kingdom Assembly of Iran" and this membership is announced as the reason for execution. The Kingdom Assembly of Iran confirmed it had worked with  Ali-Zamani, (but not Rahmanipour) and "dismissed the allegations" and insisted he had been forced to confess. The group said he had played no role in the post-election protests and had merely passed on news to its radio station.

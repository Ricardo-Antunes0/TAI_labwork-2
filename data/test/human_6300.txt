"See You Again" is a song by American rapper Wiz Khalifa, featuring American singer-songwriter Charlie Puth. It was commissioned for the soundtrack of the 2015 film Furious 7 as a tribute to actor Paul Walker, who died in a single-vehicle accident on November 30, 2013. Later on, the song was included as a bonus track on the international release of Puth's debut album, Nine Track Mind. The artists co-wrote the song with its co-producers, DJ Frank E and Andrew Cedar, with additional production from Puth and mixing provided by Manny Marroquin. "See You Again" was released on March 10, 2015, as the soundtrack's lead single in the United States. "See You Again" became both Khalifa's and Puth's biggest single to date. It spent 12 non-consecutive weeks atop the US Billboard Hot 100, tying Eminem's "Lose Yourself" for the second longest-running rap number-one single in the country behind Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus' "Old Town Road", and topped the UK Singles Chart for two consecutive weeks. It also reached number one in several other countries including Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand and Switzerland. The song held the record for the most-streamed track in a single day on Spotify in the United States, until it was surpassed by One Direction's "Drag Me Down". It set the record for most streams in a single week worldwide, and in the United Kingdom also in a single week.

Laurence Dale Richards (born 1946) was a key figure in the modern development (since 1981) of cybernetics as a transdisciplinary field of inquiry, often referred to as the new cybernetics. He was the first to create interdisciplinary masters and doctoral programs in engineering management, with curricula built explicitly on concepts drawn from systems theory and cybernetics. He served as President for both the American Society for Cybernetics (1986–88) and the American Society for Engineering Management (1998–99) and was elected an Academician in the International Academy for Systems and Cybernetic Sciences in 2010. Biography  Richards was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan and grew up in Orono, Maine. He received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Maine (1968). While serving as a pilot in the U.S. Marine Corps, he earned master's degrees in aeronautical systems from the University of West Florida (1970) and business administration from Mississippi State University (1974). He received his Ph.D. in operations research from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania (1980). Notable accomplishments included: Founding Chair of the Department of Engineering Management at Old Dominion University (1984–97); founding Executive Director of the Center for Commercial Space Infrastructure (1992–95), which subsequently morphed into the Virginia Space Flight Center and commercial spaceport on Wallops Island; Founding Dean of the School of Management and Aviation Science (1997-2004) at Bridgewater State University; inaugural Executive Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs (2004–15) and Interim Chancellor (2012–13) at Indiana University East; and, Interim Vice Chancellor & Dean for the Indiana University – Purdue University Columbus campus (2015–16).

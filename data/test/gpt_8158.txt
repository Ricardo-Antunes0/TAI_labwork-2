Frank John Gravino (January 29, 1923 - October 12, 2002) was an American mobster and boss of the Gravano crime family. He served as the acting boss of the family from 1985 to 1986 after his brother-in-law, John Gotti, was imprisoned.  Gravano was born in Brooklyn, New York to Italian-American parents. He joined the Gambino crime family in the 1940s and became a captain in its army of enforcers. In the early 1970s, Gravano became involved in a bribery and extortion scheme that led to his indictment and imprisonment on federal charges. After his release in 1976, Gravano resumed his position as a captain in the Gambino family. In 1985, following John Gotti's imprisonment, Gravano became the acting boss of the family. He quickly emerged as one of Gotti's most powerful allies and managed to stay on top of the family hierarchy despite several failed attempts on his life. In 1991, Gravano was arrested after being indicted on several new federal charges. He was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Gravano died in 2002 at the age of 80

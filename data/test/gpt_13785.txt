High Angle Control System (HACS) was a British anti-aircraft gunnery and fire control system used in most of the post-World War II British and Commonwealth aircraft. It was superseded by the more sophisticated Thales Skyfire system.  The High Angle Control System (HACS) was a British anti-aircraft gunnery and fire control system used in most of the post-World War II British and Commonwealth aircraft. It was superseded by the more sophisticated Thales Skyfire system.  The origins of the HACS date back to 1938 when the Royal Air Force (RAF) began to consider ways to improve their ability to shoot down enemy aircraft. At that time, aircraft were typically fired upon from a high angle (typically above 20 degrees), making it difficult for the gunners to hit their targets. The RAF developed the HACS to improve accuracy and survivability by, among other things, providing a way to track and fire upon enemy aircraft at high angles.   The HACS consisted of several components: an elevation mechanism, a rate of fire controller, a rangefinder, and a fire control computer. The elevation mechanism consisted of a set of gears that rotated the gun barrel up or down. The rate of fire controller regulated how quickly the gun could fire rounds, while the rangefinder determined how far away the target was. The fire control computer calculated the necessary corrections to the elevation and rate of fire inputs in order to hit the target.   HACS was

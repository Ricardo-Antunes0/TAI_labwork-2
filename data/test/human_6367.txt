Go Grrrls is a gender-specific intervention curriculum for early adolescent girls that tries to promote a positive transition to adulthood. It is a social skills building and psychoeducational program administered in a group setting—targeted towards girls in their early teens. When compared to a control group using a self-reported evaluation, the program has shown a positive effect on girls' self-efficacy, body image and assertiveness. A pilot program was launched in 1995 and a final version was published in 1999. It is administered by a team of two or more co-facilitators. The program was designed by Craig LeCroy and Janice Daley. LeCroy also published an experimental evaluation of the program. Program design  The program is partitioned into several sessions of 30-60 minutes length. They are administered over a dozen weeks and focused on six topics:  "Being a girl": introduction and evaluation, identifying gender roles and challenging societal pressures.  Positive body image and mindset: activities to boost self-image; understanding the effects of self-criticism, depression and eating disorders.  Making and keeping friends: social and life skills, independent critical thinking and developing satisfactory peer relationships.  When it all seems like too much: teach girls when to seek help and how to find resources for help.   Let’s talk about sex: basics of reproduction, sexuality and sexually transmitted diseases, how to refuse unwanted advances, and the effects of drugs and alcohol.   "Planning for the future": teach girls to make goals and work to achieve them.

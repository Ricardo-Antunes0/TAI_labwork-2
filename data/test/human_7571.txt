Chilliwack is a Canadian rock band centred on the singer and guitarist Bill Henderson. They were active from 1970 to 1988; Henderson reformed the band in 1997. The band started off with a progressive rock sound that incorporated elements of folk, indigenous, jazz and blues, before moving towards a more straight-ahead hard rock/pop rock sound by the mid-70s.  Their six best-selling songs were "My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)", "I Believe", "Whatcha Gonna Do", "Fly at Night", "Crazy Talk", and "Lonesome Mary".  The band's line-up has changed many times. History The band originated in Vancouver, British Columbia.   The members of the C-FUN Classics changed the band's name to The Collectors when Bill Henderson joined in 1966. Their psychedelic self-titled debut album yielded the minor hit "Lydia Purple". Their second album was based on the musical score written by the band for Grass and Wild Strawberries, a stage play by Canadian playwright George Ryga.

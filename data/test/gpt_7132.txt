Abacus school is a term applied to a form of education where arithmetic is taught using an abacus. The term was first used in China during the Tang Dynasty, and has been used in various countries since then.  The origins of the abacus can be traced back to ancient China. The device was first developed as a counting board in the 6th century BC, and was used extensively in accounting and commerce. It was later adapted for use in mathematics, and became popularized in Europe during the Middle Ages. The abacus was eventually replaced by the modern calculator, but remains a popular subject for study in schools around the world.  Today, abacus school is still popular in some countries, particularly in East Asia. In China, it is often seen as a symbol of traditional education. It is also used as a training ground for future mathematicians and scientists. In Japan, it is common for high school students to take courses in abacus school as part of their curriculum.

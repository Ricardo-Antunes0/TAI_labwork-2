Mohammad Obaid Kamal (born 4 September 1972) is an Indian former first-class cricketer who played for Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. He became a coach and worked as a selector for Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA) after his playing career. Career A right-arm medium-fast swing bowler, Kamal made his first-class debut for Uttar Pradesh at the age of 18 in the 1990–91 season. He finished as the third-highest wicket-taker of the 1992–93 Ranji Trophy (highest among pace bowlers) with 43 scalps at a sub-20 average. He played for Rest of India in the Irani Cup in 1993–94 at the age of 21 and switched to Punjab later that season. He soon became the first-choice new ball bowler of the zonal team and Rest of India. He returned to Uttar Pradesh after a three-season stint with Punjab, and formed a new ball pair with Ashish Zaidi. He represented India Youth XI and India A, but failed to gain selection for the national team. He played his last first-class match in November 1999 at the age of 27, and was regarded as "one of the best fast bowlers to never play for India".

The Manx Regiment – the 15th (Isle of Man) Light Anti Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery – was raised in 1938 as a Territorial Army (TA) unit of the British Army.  It recruited on the Isle of Man and formed part of Anti-Aircraft Command at the outbreak of World War II.  The regiment was posted to the Middle East in November 1940, serving in the Western Desert, East Africa and Crete (where one of its batteries was lost). In August 1942 it became the air defence regiment for the 7th Armoured Division (the 'Desert Rats'). It served with the division through the North African, Italian and North West European campaigns. It was reformed in the postwar TA as 515 (Isle of Man) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment before being reduced to a staff troop in 42nd (Lancashire) Division in 1955. Origin In 1938, during the period of international tension preceding World War II, the TA began to raise specialist Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) regiments of the Royal Artillery (RA), to supplement the existing Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) units. The  15th (Isle of Man) Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Artillery, was formed at Douglas, IoM, on 1 July 1938. It was organised with two batteries that were numbered 41 and 42 in December, and on 1 January 1939 it was redesignated as a regiment rather than a brigade, in line with the RA's modernisation of its terminology. At this stage light anti-aircraft (LAA) units were armed with Light machine guns (AALMGs), but the new Bofors 40 mm gun was on order.

The Kalakai Sanctuary is an ancient structure located on a small plateau in the Biyen River valley of the Dzungar Alatau, near the Chinaâ€“Kazakhstan border. Description  The Kalakai Sanctuary was built from boulders of various sizes to form a circle  in diameter. There is a large boulder in the centre of the sanctuary that is believed to have been deposited when an ancient glacier receded. Within the circle, several large stones have been placed to resemble a sundial, pointing to the four cardinal directions. The monument dates to the first millennium BC. Some suggest it may be older, referencing images painted on the central boulder resembling Bronze Age cave paintings. However, no reliable evidence has been found to support this claim and the paintings, as well as the sanctuary, are believed to have been made by the nomadic Saka peoples. Mounds built by the Saka have also been found nearby, but they are believed to be unrelated.

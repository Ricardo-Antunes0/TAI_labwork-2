Necklace (foaled 24 February 2001) is a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. After being bought as a yearling for Â£38,000 by Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation she showed good form in two races as a juvenile in 2002, finishing third in the Nunthorpe Stakes and fourth in the Group One Fillies' Mile. In the following year she was undefeated in five races including the 1000 Guineas and Epsom Oaks. She was retired from racing at the end of 2003 with a record of fourteen wins from twenty-one starts including three Group Ones.   Necklace has been retired to become a broodmare for Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud. She has produced three minor winners, including the filly Moonlight Cloud who placed fourth in the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes.

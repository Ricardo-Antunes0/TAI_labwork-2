Alfred Moore (May 21, 1755 – October 15, 1810) was a North Carolina judge who became an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Moore Square, a park located in the Moore Square Historic District in Raleigh, North Carolina was named in his honor, as was Moore County, North Carolina. He was also a founder and trustee of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Moore is noted for having written just one opinion for the Court during his term of service: Bas v. Tingy, a minor case of maritime law.  Although a member of the Court for nearly four years, poor health kept Moore from the Court's business during much of his tenure.  In particular he did not participate in Marbury v. Madison, a landmark case decided while he was on the Court. Moore was one of the least effective justices in the history of the Court, his career having "made scarcely a ripple in American judicial history."

Taft v. Bowers, 278 U.S. 470 (1929), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the constitutionality of the National Prohibition Act. The case involved a challenge to the federal law by two citizens of Oklahoma, one of whom was William Taft, the former President of the United States.  The National Prohibition Act, effective January 16, 1920, was a U.S. federal law that imposed prohibition on the production, importation, and sale of alcohol. It remained in effect until December 5, 1933.

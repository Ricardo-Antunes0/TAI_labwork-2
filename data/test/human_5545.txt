Uneven Structure is a progressive metal band based in Metz, France. They play a style of post-metal which is heavily influenced by the Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah. The band blends polyrhythmic passages and extremely low tunings with a heavily layered production style and ambient soundscapes. They are often categorized in the djent movement due to the Meshuggah-like guitar tone they often employ. The band was formed after the split of Longchat, a band which featured Igor Omodei and Benoit Friedrich. History The band released an EP entitled 8 in 2009, which is available as a free download in its entirety from the band's official website. The EP is made up entirely of riffs discarded from the full length they were working on at the time (which became Februus) pieced together and arranged into songs. The vocals were provided by Daniel Ã„del of the Swedish band Vildhjarta. The band stated that it was put together to show that they could release something, as Februus was taking a long time to write and record.

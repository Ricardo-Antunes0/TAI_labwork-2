Oil reserves denote the amount of crude oil and natural gas that a company or nation possesses in underground and surface deposits. The figures are based on a variety of sources, including official reports by petroleum producing countries and industry analysts.  Oil reserves are an important factor in the price of oil. They are also an important factor in the economic viability of oil production, since they affect both the amount of oil that can be produced and the price at which it can be sold.  The development of new sources of oil and gas has been a major factor in the increase in global production over the past several decades. As a result, the world's reserves of oil have increased significantly, from around 27 billion barrels in 1960 to more than 1 trillion barrels today.

Tango was a comics anthology published in the United States by Fantagraphics Books from 1995 to 2007.  Tango was the brainchild of Gary Groth, the long-time publisher of Fantagraphics Books, and was conceived as an anthology magazine that would feature comics from all over the world, without regard to format or country of origin. In its fifteen years of publication, Tango featured work by some of the most important and innovative cartoonists working today, including Spain's Ren√© Goscinny and France's Jean Giraud, as well as North American creators like Craig Thompson and Seth.  In 2007, Fantagraphics announced that it was discontinuing Tango, citing a difficult market for digital comics and a desire to focus on its more profitable book publishing endeavors. However, in 2013, Groth announced that he had acquired the rights to Tango back from Fantagraphics, and that he would be re-publishing it in print form. The first issue of Tango Monthly was released in October of that year.

Lazar "Larry" Sitsky  (born 10 September 1966) is an American mathematician and computer scientist who has made significant contributions to the theory of algorithms, graph theory, and combinatorics.  Sitsky was born in Detroit, Michigan. He attended the University of Michigan where he received a B.S. in Mathematics in 1988 and a M.S. in Mathematics in 1990. He then attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he received his Ph.D. in 1994 under the supervision of David Sussman.  After completing his doctorate, Sitsky was an assistant professor at Princeton University from 1994 to 1998, where he was also a member of the Institute for Advanced Study. He then became a professor at the University of California, Davis, where he is currently a Distinguished Professor and Chair of the Department of Mathematical Sciences.  Sitsky has made significant contributions to the theory of algorithms, graph theory, and combinatorics. His work on algorithms has focused on problems such as scheduling and transportation problems, while his work on graph theory has concerned questions such as the existence of spanning trees and thelayoutofgraphswithindirectedlinks. His work on combinatorics has focused on counting problems and extremal problems.

Otto Nebel (25 December 1892 – 12 February 1973) was a German physicist and Nobel laureate in physics.  Nebel was born in Berlin, Germany, on 25 December 1892. He studied at the University of Berlin and then at the University of Göttingen, where he received his doctorate in 1916. From 1916 to 1918 he was an assistant at the University of Heidelberg.  In 1918 Nebel became an associate professor at the University of Berlin. In 1922 he became a full professor there, and in 1934 he became rector of the university. In 1946 he became a full professor at the RWTH Aachen and retired in 1958.  Nebel was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1954 "for his pioneering work on the photoelectric effect and on the development of quantum mechanics". He died in Aachen, Germany, on 12 February 1973.  Nebel's research focused on the study of light and its behavior under various conditions. In particular, he made significant contributions to the development of quantum mechanics, including work on the photoelectric effect and on the theory of wave-particles duality.

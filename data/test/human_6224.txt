Sarolta Geőcze de Szendrő (; 27 December 1862 – 23 September 1928) was a Hungarian Christian socialist women's rights activist and educator. Life Geőcze was born on 27 December 1862 in the village of Bacskó in the Kingdom of Hungary, now part of Slovakia. She graduated from the State Institute for the Instruction of Women Primary School Teachers ( (Buda Institute)) in 1882 and then later the State Institute for the Instruction of Women Secondary School Teachers ( (Pest Institute)). She was recommended for a position at a girls' intermediate school in Brassó County (now in Romania) in 1886 and was director of the school two years later. Geőcze was transferred to another girls' intermediate school in Komárom County in 1892 and remained there for five years. After a year abroad to study teaching methods in religious schools, she began teaching at the Pest Institute in 1898. She was controversially appointed director of the Buda Institute in 1907 as some thought her under-qualified. However she remained for the next decade. Geőcze was fired in 1917 and started teaching again at the Pest Institute shortly afterwards until her retirement in 1926. She died in Budapest two years later.

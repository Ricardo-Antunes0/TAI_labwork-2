Anemophily or wind pollination is a form of pollination in which pollen is blown by the wind to plants of the same family, genera, or species.  Anemophily is a form of pollination in which pollen is blown by the wind to plants of the same family, genera, or species. Wind pollination is most commonly seen in angiosperms (flowering plants), but it can also occur in gymnosperms and some monocots. The anemophilous plant produces anthers (male reproductive parts) that are more sensitive to wind than other parts of the plant. The anthers are able to open easily and release their pollen with little assistance from the plant.

Danforth GO Station  is a railway station on GO Transit's Lakeshore East line in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The station is situated in the east end of Old Toronto, south west of the intersection of Main Street and Danforth Avenue.  The station is a short walk from Main Street station on Line 2 Bloorâ€“Danforth of the Toronto subway. History Because of a lack of available land to expand their existing downtown yard, the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) decided to build a new freight yard on farmland south of Danforth Avenue where the line to Montreal crossed Dawes Road, which had to be closed and traffic diverted to a new street called Main. The yard had a capacity of 420 cars and could store 31 locomotives in a roundhouse with adjacent repair shops. The York Railway Station was built on the north side of the tracks just east of Main Street around 1883. The GTR became part of Canadian National Railways in 1923 and by the 1940s the yard was no longer used for freight and the roundhouse was demolished. Under Canadian National the station became Danforth Railway Station. The original GTR station building was demolished in 1974.

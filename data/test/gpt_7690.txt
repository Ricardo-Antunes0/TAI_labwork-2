The Eabametoong First Nation is a member of the Treaty 6 Nations and is governed by a democratically elected band council. The First Nation has a population of 1,246 people and its primary economic activity is forestry.

The Eabametoong First Nation was first settled around 1800 by the Saulteaux people.

The name Eabametoong means "place where the eagle dwells".

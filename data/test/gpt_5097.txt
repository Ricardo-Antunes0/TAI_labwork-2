Eliminationist antisemitism is an extreme form of antisemitism that advocates for the elimination of Jews as a people. This ideology is often expressed in violent and aggressive terms, and is considered to be one of the most dangerous forms of antisemitism.  Eliminationist antisemitism has been on the rise in recent years, with incidents reported across Europe and North America. This form of antisemitism has been linked to a number of hate crimes, including physical assaults and vandalism against Jewish communities.  Eliminationist antisemitism is believed to be motivated by anti-Jewish hatred and resentment, and it demonizes the Jews as a people without any legitimate grounds. This ideology has been used to justify the persecution and murder of Jews throughout history, and it remains a potent threat today.   Efforts must be made to combat eliminationist antisemitism wherever it exists, as this form of hate speech cannot be tolerated. It is important to remember that all Jews are entitled to the same rights and protections under the law, no matter their religious or ethnic background.

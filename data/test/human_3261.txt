Beautiful People is a 1971 album by UK pop group The New Seekers. This was the group's third album and their last one released in the UK on the Philips record label. It was their first to be solely produced by David Mackay, who would guide the group through their most successful period over the next two years. Overview  The New Seekers had found top 20 success in the US with the song "Look What They've Done to My Song Ma" in 1970, which was also a more minor hit in the UK. Subsequent singles, however, failed to attract as much attention until mid-1971 when they released "Never Ending Song of Love", which was featured on this album. The song rose to #2 in the UK and became one of the biggest selling singles of the year, remaining on the chart for 17 weeks. This album, which was released in May 1971 also included the earlier singles "When There's No Love Left" (released in December 1970) and the US-release "Beautiful People", which was written by Melanie Safka, who had also penned the group's first hit. This latter single made #67 on the Billboard Hot 100. The US version of the album differed from the UK release with a slightly different track listing. This was the group's first album release there and reached #136 on the US album charts.

Paolo Veneziano, also Veneziano Paolo or Paolo da Venezia, (1493-1557) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance.  Born in Venice, he trained with Titian and then moved to Rome, where he became one of the leading painters of the High Renaissance. He also worked in Venice, where he had his greatest influence. Veneziano is perhaps best known for his altarpieces, including the Assumption of the Virgin and the Coronation of the Virgin. He also painted a number of secular subjects, including a series of portraits of contemporary Venetian leaders.  Veneziano was born in Venice on 1493 or 1494, according to different sources. His father, Giovanni da Venezia, was a painter who had moved to Venice from Verona around 1485. The younger Paolo began his apprenticeship with his father around 1500 and then studied under Titian (1500-1576). After Titian's death, he continued his studies with Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571-1610) and Federico Zuccari (1572-1626). He probably moved to Rome around 1524. In Rome, he was one of the most important painters of the High Renaissance. He became one of the six members of the Accademia di S. Luca in 1541 and served as its president from 1547-1550. He also worked in Venice, where he had his greatest influence. Veneziano died

The discography of Rosenstolz, a German pop duo from Berlin, includes 12 studio albums and at least 40 singles, released between 1992 and 2012. The band also released a number of live albums, six compilation albums and video albums. Rosenstolz's first chart hit was "Herzensschöner", which reached No. 34 in the German singles chart in 1998. However, it was not until 2000 with the release of the single "Amo Vitam" that the band received frequent airplay on German music television stations. The following year, "Es könnt' ein Anfang sein" became the band's first German top 10 single. Rosenstolz's great breakthrough in Germany then came in 2004 with the album Herz, which reached triple platinum status and gave rise to four top 20 singles, including "Liebe ist alles" and "Willkommen".  Major chart hits from later albums were "Ich bin ich (Wir sind wir)", "Gib mir Sonne" and "Wir sind am Leben", which peaked at No. 2, No. 1 and No. 3, respectively, in the German singles chart.

Chaka M. Patterson (born November 27, 1968) is an American former professional basketball player who played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for thirteen seasons. A shooting guard, Patterson was a prolific scorer and one of the most explosive players in the league during his era. He is considered one of the greatest shooting guards in NBA history and one of the most versatile players in league history, being able to score from behind the arc and on drives to the basket.  Patterson was born in Dayton, Ohio, and played high school basketball at Findlay Prep in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the eighteenth pick of the 1988 NBA draft, and he spent his first four seasons with the team. In 1992, he was traded to the Toronto Raptors, where he won a championship in 1995. After playing for the Memphis Grizzlies and Miami Heat, Patterson finished his career with the Philadelphia 76ers. He was twice named an All-Star (1996 and 2001) and won three scoring titles (1995–1997, 1998–1999, 2002–2003). Patterson also played on three NBA All-Rookie First Teams (1992, 1993–1994, 1995).  After his retirement from professional basketball, Patterson started a clothing line and became a television commentator. In July 2016, he was announced as a coach for HBK Elite of Australia’s National Basketball League (NBL).

Since 1933, various traditional chiefs in Nyasaland have had the power to issue licenses to prospectors, impose taxes, and administer justice. The chiefs are known as 'native authorities'.  The Nyasaland Native Authority (NNA) was established in 1933 by a group of traditional chiefs from the Central Highlands region of Nyasaland. The NNA was modeled after the British Colonial Office's Native Authority system in Kenya. The NNA was tasked with administering justice, issuing licenses to prospectors, and imposing taxes. The NNA also had the power to administer land and resource rights.  The NNA was abolished in 1964. The main reason for its abolition was that the NNA was not effective in administering justice. There were also complaints about the NNA's tax administration and its power to issue licenses to prospectors.

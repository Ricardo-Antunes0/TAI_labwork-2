Brooklyn the Musical is a musical with a book and lyrics by Tony Kushner, music by Stephen Sondheim, and direction by Jason Robert Brown. The musical tells the story of two lovers – one Jewish, one Irish – who are forced to flee their homes in 1939 Brooklyn during the onset of World War II. They find refuge in the working class neighborhood of Bushwick, and struggle to maintain their relationship while living in a new and often hostile world.  The musical was first produced on Broadway in 1993, and won five Tony Awards, including Best Musical. It has since been produced worldwide, including a production at the Royal National Theatre in London which won the Olivier Award for Best New Musical. A film adaptation of the musical was released in 2014.  Brooklyn (musical)

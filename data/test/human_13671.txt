Sigrid Onégin (June 1, 1889 – June 16, 1943) was a Franco-German operatic contralto who enjoyed a major international career prior to World War II. She was celebrated for the richness of its tone, its flexibility, its size, and its expert coloratura technique. She also possessed a remarkably wide vocal range. Biography She was born in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1889 to a German father and a French mother. This renowned contralto first sang professionally under her maiden name, Lilly Hoffmann. She made her first public appearance, under the name Lilly Hoffmann, in Wiesbaden, Sept. 16, 1911, in a recital. She was accompanied on that occasion by a Russian pianist and composer, Baron Eugene Borisovitch Lvov Onégin (b. St. Petersburg, Oct. 10, 1883; d. Stuttgart, Nov. 12, 1919), a Russian émigré, pianist and composer. He had adopted the surname of Pushkin’s celebrated hero, Onégin; his real name was 'Lvov', and he was a grandnephew of Alexis Lvov, composer of the Russian Czarist hymn. Hoffmann and Onégin married in London on May 25, 1912, after which she sang briefly as Lilly Hoffmann-Onégin before settling on Sigrid Onégin, the name by which she became famous.

Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway (DW&WR) 52 was a 2-6-2T steam locomotive that was built in 1930 by the Vulcan Foundry in Newton Abbot, England.  The DW&WR 52 was originally constructed as a shunter for the railway, but it proved to be too powerful for its intended duties and was eventually sold to the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1936. The locomotive saw service on the GWR until it was retired in 1957.  The DW&WR 52 has since been preserved by the National Museum of Ireland and is on display at their Dublin museum.

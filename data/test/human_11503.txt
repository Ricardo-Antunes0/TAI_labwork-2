Rhian Sheehan is a New Zealand composer and producer born in Nelson and now based in Wellington. He is known for his fusing of orchestral chamber music and piano, with ambient electronic and post-rock cinematic atmospheres. He has also written music for film, television, video games, exhibitions, advertisements, roller coaster rides, and planetarium dome shows. Career Sheehan released his debut album Paradigm Shift in 2001. The record was issued in the UK almost two years later in 2003, and received praise from music critics. In 2004, Britain's Future Music Magazine magazine named Sheehan as "The Next Big Thing" in ambient music. His 2009 album Standing in Silence, 2013's Stories from Elsewhere, and 2018's A Quiet Divide step away from his earlier electronica work into more of a shoegaze, post-rock, ambient, chamber music direction. Eminent US reviewer John Diliberto (host of Echoes) called Stories from Elsewhere "a modern ambient chamber music masterpiece of quietly epic dimensions".

Systems ecology is an interdisciplinary field of study that combines ecology, physiology, and engineering to describe the interactions between organisms and their environment.  Systems ecology is concerned with understanding how populations and communities of organisms interact with each other and their physical environment. The field has developed over the past three decades, as researchers have recognized the importance of understanding how multiple levels of organization (from individual organisms to populations to communities) interact with each other to create ecosystems.  Systems ecology is used to understand a wide range of problems, from the impact of human activities on natural systems to the effects of climate change. Researchers in systems ecology use a variety of methods, including experiments, field studies, and computer modeling. They also work together with other researchers in related fields, such as agricultural science, engineering, and mathematics.

Kathleen Annette (born 1955) is a public artist and sculptor. She is known for her large-scale public sculpture, which often deals with environmental and political issues.  Kathleen Annette was born in 1955 in Seattle, Washington. After completing her undergraduate studies at the University of Washington, she moved to New York City in 1977 to study art at the School of Visual Arts.  Annette's early work was abstract, but she soon found herself drawn to making large-scale public sculptures. Her first project was a sculpture of a bear that was installed in a park in Philadelphia in 1984. Her work has since been displayed around the world, including in Australia, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, and the United Kingdom.  Annette's sculptures often deal with environmental and political issues. For example, her sculpture "The Tumbleweed Project" (1989) features a line of tumbleweeds that reference the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Her sculpture "The Weight of History" (2002) is made from recycled metal and glass and celebrates the resilience of nature.  Annette has also created artwork for film and television. She was featured in the 2006 documentary film "The Act of Killing" and created the artwork for the 2013 film "Gravity". She is currently working on a new film project called "The Garden".  Annette has been married to artist Mel Chin since 1985. The couple has two children and lives in New York City.

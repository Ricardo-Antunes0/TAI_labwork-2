The Aleppo Revolutionary Council (; Majlis Thuwar al-Aleppo) was a provisional council formed in early 2012 to administer the rebel-held city of Aleppo following its capture from the Syrian government in early 2012. The council was composed of delegates from various rebel groups and local councils.  The council was dissolved in late 2013, after failing to agree upon a unified administration for the city. In early 2014, the Syrian National Coalition announced that it would form a new governing body for Aleppo, which it called the Aleppo Revolutionary Council-2.

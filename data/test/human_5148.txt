Brother Clyde is the debut studio album from alternative rock group Brother Clyde. It is the first side-project from country music singer Billy Ray Cyrus. The album features duets with Cyrus' son Trace Cyrus as well as Dolly Parton, who Cyrus said "wanted to rock." It was released on August 10, 2010. Its first single, "Lately", which features rapper King Phaze, was issued to digital retailers on June 29, 2010, and a music video, which was directed by Cyrus, was released for the song in July 2010. Background While the original line up for the band included Billy Ray Cyrus, John Waite, Jeffrey Steele and Phil Vassar, the artists' schedules became too busy for the band to meet up and record material for their debut album. However, in 2009, Cyrus was filming Christmas in Canaan and he came across Morris Joseph Tancredi. The two began to talk about music and Tancredi played Cyrus a song he had written, called "Lately." Cyrus immediately took a liking to the song and asked Tancredi if he had any more material. Soon after, Cyrus met with Samantha Maloney, Jamie Miller, Dan Knight and Dave Henning. The five of them soon became the new line up for Brother Clyde, with Cyrus as the head of the band.

Stearns Wharf is a pier at the southern end of the Embarcadero in San Francisco, California. The wharf extends 2,000 feet into the bay and its pier reaches a depth of 120 feet. It was built between 1879 and 1883 by George Stearns, and was originally called the Stearns Wharf Pier.  The pier served as the terminus for the Sacramento Steamship Company's ferry service to San Francisco. The ferry landing was located at the base of the pier, above the present-day foot traffic area. In 1886, the pier was extended further into the bay with a new pier at its northern end, and the ferries were moved to this new pier. The original pier was rebuilt in 1909 with a new deck and an arcade of shops. In 1922, a new pedestrian bridge was built over the bay to connect the two piers. The old bridge was torn down in 1970.  Today, Stearns Wharf is a popular tourist destination containing several restaurants, cafes and shops. It is also used by kayakers as part of the Bay Trail system.

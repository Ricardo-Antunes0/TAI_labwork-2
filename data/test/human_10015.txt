Yorgo Carlo George Kehdy  (born in Silivri, Turkey in 1900, died in Istanbul in 1977;  in Greek) was a master oud player and improvisational composer  of Ottoman classical music. His father Carlo was of Greek gypsy descent, and a legendary oud improviser, and several in his family were kemençe artists. He was largely responsible for introducing the young Yorgo to music, presenting him with his first oud at the age of five. Yorgo soon left school (the Saint Benoit High School) to concentrate on music full-time—he had made his first public appearance in the Eftalofos Club in Taksim at the age of twelve. Rapidly achieving fame, he started performing  on Turkish Radio in 1927, and went on performing there for 51 years, until his death.  In 1928, he visited Berlin with his brother , and Kanuni Ahmet Yatman  and performed in records of Hafiz Kemal and Hafiz Sadettin Kaynak; in the next year, he performed in Paris, with the violinist , and Deniz Kızı Eftalya; he further went on to Cairo with the same band.

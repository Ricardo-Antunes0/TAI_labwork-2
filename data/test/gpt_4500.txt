Anse de Sablettes is a fortified bay on the east coast of Grande-Terre, an island in the Leeward Islands.  The bay is located on a promontory that juts out into the sea. The bay is about wide and deep, and it is protected by a series of limestone cliffs. The bay is known for its excellent anchorage, and it has been used by French colonists as a port for ships sailing to the Caribbean.  The bay was named after a small island that lies offshore. The island is known as Anse de Sablettes because of the black sand that covers its surface. The island was first sighted by a French expedition led by Jean-Baptiste Bougainville in 1764.

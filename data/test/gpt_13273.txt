The Minimum Credible Deterrence (MCD; officially named the Nuclear Weapons Minimum Credible Deterrence) is a concept in nuclear deterrence theory. It is the lowest level of nuclear attack that would be considered sufficiently credible for deterring an adversary from attacking with nuclear weapons.  The Minimum Credible Deterrence is determined by the number of nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles that an adversary believes the United States possesses. An attack with fewer weapons, or less capable delivery vehicles, would be less costly and more likely to cause casualties, but would also be considered less credible.

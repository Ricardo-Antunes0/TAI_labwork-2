Eliminator is a children's quiz show in which a group of three children have to answer questions in order to get to the next level of the game, while being chased by a demon named the "Eliminator" who would try to reach them.  The show produced two series between 6 January 2003 and 29 April 2004, and was presented by Michael Underwood. Rules The aim of the game would be to try to get to the next level, by jumping squares, similar to a board game, without the Eliminator catching the team and eliminating them from the game. After the computer randomly selects one of the eight question categories, they could choose to answer an easy question to move one square, a medium question to move two squares, or a hard question to move three squares. All questions are multiple choice, with 3 possible answers in Series 1, and 4 possible answers in Series 2.

Nightmare in Wax is a 1969 horror film directed by Terence Fisher and written by Clive Barker. The film is based on the short story "The Face" by Barker.  The film tells the story of a waxwork exhibition that is visited by a group of teenagers on a school trip. The waxworks are populated by horrific and grotesque figures, some of which begin to move and attack the visitors.  The film was poorly received by critics, but has since been noted for its graphical and conceptual artistic qualities.

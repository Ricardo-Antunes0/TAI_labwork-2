Ovidiu Cotruș (February 24, 1926–September 12, 1977) was a Romanian essayist and literary critic. Early life Born in Oradea, his parents were Sabin Cotruș, a geography teacher, and his wife Claudia (née Popa); his uncle was Aron Cotruș. He began high school in Oradea, continuing at the Moise Nicoară High School in Arad. The family had taken refuge there due to the Second Vienna Award's 1940 grant of their native Northern Transylvania to Hungary, and Cotruș graduated in 1944. He studied at the literature and philosophy faculty of Cluj University from 1944 to 1948. At the beginning of his university career, this institution was in Sibiu, because Cluj had been integrated into Hungary through the Vienna Award. He was received into the Sibiu Literary Circle, where he was an active participant. Although Cotruș' first published work had appeared in 1943, in the Arad Societatea de mâine magazine, he considered his real debut to have taken place in 1945. This involved poems and reviews published under the pen name Ovidiu Sabin in Revista Cercului Literar din Sibiu, the Circle's publication.

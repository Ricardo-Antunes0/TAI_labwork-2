The Second Fiji expedition was an 1859â€“60 British expedition to the Fiji Islands. It was the second of a series of three expeditions led by James Cook during his third and final voyage of the HMS Endeavour.  The expedition was preceded by the First Fiji expedition, which had been sent to establish British sovereignty over the islands after their annexation by the United Kingdom in 1874. The Second Fiji expedition was more ambitious, intending to explore the whole of the archipelago, and to map it in detail. The main objectives were to find a route from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean and to survey the location of potential trading posts.  The expedition achieved few of its objectives, though it did provide much valuable information about Fiji and its inhabitants. The main result was the publication in 1860 of Cook's three-volume account, Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific and Melanesia.

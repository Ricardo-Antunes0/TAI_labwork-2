Chloe is a fictional character from the British soap opera Hollyoaks, played by Susan Loughnane. The character made her first on-screen appearance on 12 August 2013. Loughnane had to audition for the role. Initially appearing in a small number of episodes, Loughnane returned to film new storylines. Chloe is introduced into the show as the mother of Matthew McQueen. The character has earned a reputation as a "serial surrogate mother" from selling her babies. Chloe sold Matthew to John Paul McQueen (James Sutton) and Craig Dean (Guy Burnett). While on-screen she agrees to sell another baby to Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) and later Carmel McQueen (Gemma Merna). Chloe has featured in a same sex kiss with Tilly Evans (Lucy Dixon). Chloe's behaviour has been the focus of critics. The Evening Herald's Eimear Rabbitte viewed Chloe as a troublemaker. Laura Morgan from Inside Soap said that she was a "crafty" female. Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy believed she has "history of erratic behaviour".

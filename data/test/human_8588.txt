"Duppy Freestyle" is a song by Canadian rapper Drake. Released on May 25, 2018, the song is a diss track aimed at American rappers Pusha-T and Kanye West. The song was produced by Boi-1da and Jahaan Sweet. Background On the final track of Pusha-T's 2018 album Daytona, "Infrared", Pusha-T perpetuates allegations of ghostwriting which have been leveled against Drake. In response to the track, Drake released a song on the same day of the album's release called Duppy Freestyle. Drake posted on Instagram a few hours after the release of this song, sending subliminals to Pusha-T with a photo of a bill OVO had sent to G.O.O.D Music and Def Jam for $100,000 captioned “You’re welcome”. The satirical reason behind the bill was “promotional assistance and career reviving". The song garnered significant media attention, as well as a response from Pusha-T on Twitter. Pusha-T responded to the track by releasing a response track titled "The Story of Adidon" four days later.

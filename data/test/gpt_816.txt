Rudolf Kirchschläger, GColIH (; 20 March 1915 – 4 July 2001) was an Austrian composer, conductor and music educator. He was born in Vienna, and studied at the University of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna with Heinz Holliger and Karlheinz Stockhausen. He also received instruction from Arthur Honegger and Roger Dannenberg.  Kirchschläger's early works were influenced by serialism and minimalism, but he later developed a distinct compositional style that emphasized textural and harmonic complexity. His pieces have been performed worldwide, and he has been awarded several prestigious prizes, including the Austrian State Prize for Music in 1989. He served as the director of the Mozarteum Salzburg from 1966 to 1984.

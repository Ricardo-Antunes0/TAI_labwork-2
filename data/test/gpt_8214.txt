Duilio (often known as Caio Duilio) was an Italian battleship, one of the most successful ships of her type during World War I. She was also the second ship of the Regia Marina to be named for Duilio Calvino, a poet of the renaissance.  Duilio was laid down on 30 September 1911 at the Cantiere navale della Dalmazia in Venice, and launched on 14 December 1912. She was completed on 24 May 1914 and commissioned into the Regia Marina on 2 July 1914.  Duilio participated in numerous naval engagements during World War I, including the Battle of Calabria on 10 September 1914; the Battle of Matapan on 28 March 1915; and the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916. She was also present at the Battle of Cape Spada on 17 May 1917 and the Battle of Messina on 3 July 1917. Duilio was decommissioned on 3 November 1918 and returned to her builders for repairs.  Duilio was reactivated on 4 January 1920 and served as a training ship until she was decommissioned for final time on 16 December 1930. She was stricken from the register on 15 February 1931 and sold for scrap to La Spezia Iron Works in January 1933.

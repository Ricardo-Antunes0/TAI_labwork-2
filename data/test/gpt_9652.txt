Lulu City was a transient mining town in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado. The community was established in 1897 and lasted until 1906, when a major landslide destroyed the town. Today, only scattered remnants of the town can be found.  Lulu City was located in the San Juan Mountains near the present-day town of Silverton. The town was established in 1897 by prospectors searching for gold and silver deposits. The first settlers arrived in the summer of that year, and by the end of the year there were approximately seventy people living in Lulu City. The community grew rapidly as more miners arrived to search for minerals.  The town was located near several small creeks that served as water sources for the residents. However, the town was vulnerable to landslides caused by heavy rains or snowmelt. On June 5, 1906, a major landslide destroyed Lulu City, killing twenty-four people and injuring dozens more. The remains of the town can still be found today, scattered across a wide area near the present-day town of Silverton.

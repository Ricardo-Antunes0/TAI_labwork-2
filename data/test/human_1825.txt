Ravayat-e Fath , variously translated as The Chronicles of Victory, The Tales of Victory, The Narrative of Victory, The Narration of Victory, The Story of Victory, and Witness to Glory, was a war documentary television series directed by Morteza Avini and filmed on the front lines of the Iranâ€“Iraq War of the 1980s. It is one of the most famous works of Avini, and one of the first and most important war documentary films in the history of Iranian cinema. The series presents witnessing discourse through footage of front-line sacrifices set against commentary by Avini. The documentary film "literally brought the details of war into people's living rooms every night". The series had a mystic and spiritual theme. After the Iraqi invasion of Iran, Avini went to the front-line, founded Jihad TV Unit , and trained its crewmembers ideologically and technically. At least seven Jihad TV crew members, including Avini himself, were killed in the process of making the series. Jihad TV continued to operate as a production unit for years after the war and after Avini. According to Hamid Naficy, what made the documentary series stand out was "its promotion of multiple sacred subjectivities on behalf of the warriors who were filmed, the cameramen who filmed them, and the spectators who watched them".

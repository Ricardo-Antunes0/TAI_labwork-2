Eucalyptus bunyip is a rare, slender tree that is endemic to a small area near Tonimbuk in Victoria. It has smooth, light coloured bark, glossy green egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped adult leaves, club-shaped buds arranged in groups of seven, white flowers and bell-shaped fruit on a relatively long pedicel. Description Eucalyptus bunyip is a slender tree typically growing to a height of about  with smooth, whitish to light brown or yellowish bark with rough corky bark at the base of the trunk. The leaves on young plants are egg-shaped to lance-shaped,  long and  wide on a petiole  long. Later, intermediate leaves are up to  long and  wide. Mature trees have large numbers of intermediate leaves in the crown. The adult leaves are broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped,  long and  wide on a petiole  long. They are more or less the same colour on both surfaces. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on a thin, delicate peduncle  long, about  in diameter, the individual buds on a pedicel about the same length as the buds. The mature buds are club-shaped to slightly diamond-shaped,  long and  wide with a slightly beaked operculum. Flowering occurs in autumn and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, more or less hemispherical capsule up to  long and  wide on a slender pedicel  long.

Hans Klumbach (26 April 1904 â€“ 14 May 1988) was a German mathematician and physicist.  Klumbach was born in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria. He studied mathematics and physics at the University of Munich, where he was a student of Arnold Sommerfeld. In 1932 he became an associate professor at the University of Munich, and in 1934 he obtained his habilitation. From 1938 to 1945 he was a professor at the University of Berlin. After the war Klumbach returned to Munich, where he became a full professor in 1950. He retired in 1971.  Klumbach made major contributions to mathematics and physics, including work on differential geometry, functional analysis, mathematical physics, nonlinear dynamics and fractals. His most famous work is probably his development of the theory of fractional calculus in the 1930s.

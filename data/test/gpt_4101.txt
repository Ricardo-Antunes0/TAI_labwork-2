An astrolabe  is an ancient astronomical instrument consisting of a metal frame that can be rotated to show the position of the stars and planets. It was used to determine latitude, longitude, and time.  The astrolabe was invented in the Hellenistic period (323-30 BC) in Alexandria, Egypt. Its invention is credited to Ptolemy (90-168 AD). Ptolemy's instrument consisted of a disk with 24 divisions that could be turned to show the positions of the sun, moon, planets, and stars.

Scrubber systems (e.g. chemical scrubbers, gas scrubbers) are used to remove pollutants from air, water, or waste.  A scrubber system is a machine used to clean up pollutants. These systems can be used to clean air, water, or waste. Scrubbers use filters, scrubber beds, or adsorbents to remove particles from the air, water, or waste. These systems can be used to clean up air pollution, water pollution, or industrial pollution.

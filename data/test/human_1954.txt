Parzival is a medieval romance by the knight-poet Wolfram von Eschenbach in Middle High German. The poem, commonly dated to the first quarter of the 13th century, centers on the Arthurian hero Parzival (Percival in English) and his long quest for the Holy Grail following his initial failure to achieve it. Parzival begins with the knightly adventures of Parzival's father, Gahmuret, his marriage to Herzeloyde (, "heart's sorrow"), and the birth of Parzival.  The story continues as Parzival meets three elegant knights, decides to seek King Arthur, and continues a spiritual and physical search for the Grail. A long section is devoted to Parzival's friend Gawan and his adventures defending himself from a false murder charge and winning the hand of the maiden Orgeluse.  Among the most striking elements of the work are its emphasis on the importance of humility, compassion, sympathy and the quest for spirituality.   A major theme in  Parzival is love: heroic acts of chivalry are inspired by true love, which is ultimately fulfilled in marriage.

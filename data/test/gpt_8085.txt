Stephan Micus (; born 19 January 1953) is a Czech composer and pianist. He has written music for theatre, film and television, and has been awarded several prestigious prizes, including the Ostrava Music Prize in 1984.  Stephan Micus was born in 1953 in Prague, Czechoslovakia. His father was a cellist and his mother played the violin. Micus began playing the piano at the age of six and soon showed a talent for composition. He studied at the Prague Conservatory with Jiří Bělohlávek and Jaroslav Ševčík, graduating in 1974 with honours.  Micus's early works were inspired by the work of Antonín Dvořák, Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich. He later developed his own style, which is characterised by its use of dissonance and its often dramatic soundscape. His music has been performed by leading orchestras around the world, including the Berlin Philharmonic, the London Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.  He has been awarded several prestigious prizes, including the Ostrava Music Prize in 1984. In 2007 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Masaryk University in Brno. Micus currently lives in Prague with his wife and two children.

Al-Badeel (, lit. “the alternative”) was a Syrian opposition news website. The website was launched on 14 September 2011, and was closed on 5 December 2013.  The website was established by a team of journalists who were opposed to the policies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Al-Badeel was one of the first opposition websites to be launched in Syria, and it quickly became one of the most popular websites among the Syrian opposition.  Al-Badeel was considered to be independent and politically unbiased, and its journalists often reported on sensitive issues that were not covered by other opposition websites. The website also had a strong social media presence, and its reporters frequently used Twitter and other social media platforms to disseminate their stories.  Al-Badeel was closed down by the Syrian government in December 2013, shortly after the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War. The website's staff later fled to Turkey.

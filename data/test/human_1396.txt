The Mid-Am Racing Series, formerly Mid American Stock Car Series, is a traveling stock car racing series in the Midwestern United States.  The cars are based on a 108" metric stock frame, less costly suspension parts and a maximum of 358 cubic inch engine. The car's roll cage and chassis were made of a design very similar to the same chassis a previous design of NASCAR cup chassis, but have also included more modern safety features such as plated door bars and the "Earnhardt bar" which runs from the roof to the dash.  The series runs primarily on paved racetracks but also appears on dirt and road courses. History  The series was founded in 1993 by Gary Vercauteran. The Series was at one time a support class for the ARTGO Challenge Series.  The Mid American corporation expanded to a traveling Supertruck Series named the Midwest Super Truck Series in 1995 and a traveling Super Late Model Series, named the Midwest All-Star Racing Series (MARS) in 1999.  The expansion also included the Stock Car Classics in 2004 and the American Stock Car League (ASL) in 2005.  The death of Vercauteran in October 2005 led to the purchase of Mid-American by longtime employees Doug and Julie Strasburg.  The Strasburgs kept only the Mid American Stock Car Series while MARS and ASL were dissolved.  The Stock Car Classics split into two groups (Classic Racing Series and Midwest Stock Car Classics). The Super Trucks were absorbed into the United States Super Trucks or USST.

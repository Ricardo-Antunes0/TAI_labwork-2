John Kettlewell (10 March 1653 â€“ 12 November 1724) was an English physician and scientist.  Kettlewell was born in London, the son of a prosperous draper. He initially followed his father's trade, but in 1675 he began studying medicine at the University of Oxford. After completing his medical studies, Kettlewell travelled to Paris, where he gained valuable experience in the medical profession. He returned to England in 1686 and set up a medical practice in Southwark.  Kettlewell became interested in scientific research and in 1702 he founded the Royal Society. He served as president of the society from 1707 to 1710 and from 1713 to 1724. Kettlewell is best known for his work on phrenology, a pseudoscience which claimed that the size and shape of a person's skull could indicate their character and intelligence. However, Kettlewell's experiments with phrenology were controversial and he was eventually forced to retire from practice due to financial difficulties.  Kettlewell died in London aged 77. He was buried in the parish church of St John-at-Hackney.

Typhoon Clara, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Rubing, left flooding in the northern Philippines and southern China during September 1981. An area of disturbed weather was first detected on September 11 near Ponape. After moving westward, the system gradually became better organized and thunderstorm activity increased. On September 16, the system attained tropical storm status. Two days later, Clara attained typhoon intensity and subsequently began to deepen at a faster rate. On September 19, Clara reached maximum intensity, before making landfall along the northern tip of Luzon. Clara steadily weakened after interacting with land, but by late on September 20, Clara leveled off in intensity over the South China Sea. The next day, Clara moved ashore to the east-northeast of Hong Kong while still at typhoon intensity before rapidly dissipating over land. In the Philippines, 55 people perished. A total of 7,125 homes were damaged and 1,195 houses were destroyed, which left nearly 4,000 people homeless in one province alone. Damage was estimated at $13.4 million (1981 USD), mostly from crops. Offshore, two ships were wrecked, leading to 79 fatalities, although 48 others were rescued. Across China, almost  of farmland were flooded or destroyed, several thousand individuals lost their homes, and 62 people were killed.

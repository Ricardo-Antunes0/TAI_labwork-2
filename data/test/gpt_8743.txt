Masonry is one of the world's oldest fraternal organizations. Its origins can be traced back to the Middle Ages, when stonemasons formed guilds to protect their trade and earn a living. Freemasonry spread to North America in the 18th century and became popular in New York City in the early 19th century. The first Masonic Temple in New York City was built on William Street in Lower Manhattan in 1784. The present Masonic Hall was built on West 23rd Street in 1892 and is the oldest surviving Masonic building in New York City.

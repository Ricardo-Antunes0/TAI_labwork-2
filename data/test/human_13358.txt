Similar braille conventions are used for three languages of India and Nepal that in print are written in Devanagari script: Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali. These are part of a family of related braille alphabets known as Bharati Braille.  There are apparently some differences between the Nepali braille alphabet of India and that of Nepal. System Although basically alphabetic, Devanagari Braille retains one aspect of Indian abugidas, in that the default vowel a is not written unless it occurs at the beginning of a word or before a vowel. For example, braille  (the consonant K) renders print  ka, and braille  (TH), print  tha. To indicate that a consonant is not followed by a vowel (as when followed by another consonant, or at the end of a syllable), a halant (vowel-cancelling) prefix is used:  (∅–K) is  k, and  (∅–TH) is  th.  (When writing in Hindi, the halant is generally omitted at the end of a word, following the convention in print.) However, unlike in an abugida, there are no vowel diacritics in Devanagari Braille:  Vowels are written with full letters following the consonant regardless of their order in print. For example, in print the vowel i is prefixed to a consonant in a reduced diacritic form,  ki, but in braille it follows in its full form:  (K–I), equivalent to writing  for ki in print. Thus  klika is written in braille as  (∅–K–L–I–K). The one time when a non-initial a is written in braille is when it is followed by another vowel.  In this environment the a must be written to indicate that it exists, as otherwise the subsequent vowel will be read as following the consonant immediately. Thus a true  kai in print is rendered in braille as  (K–A–I).

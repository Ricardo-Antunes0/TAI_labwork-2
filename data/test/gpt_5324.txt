Levinz was the son of Francis Levinz of Grove Hall and his wife Elizabeth Gorges, daughter of Sir John Gorges. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge where he was a Fellow from 1693. In 1694 he succeeded his father to Grove Hall.   Levinz entered Parliament in 1722 as MP for Hertfordshire, a seat he held until 1747. He served as Joint Commissioner for Trade and Plantations from 1727 to 1729 and as Paymaster-General from 1730 to 1734.

Mordecai Buckner (ca. 1735 – 1787) was an American frontiersman, fur trader, and explorer.  Mordecai Buckner was born circa 1735 in Pennsylvania. He was the son of Esther (née Buckner) and Mordecai Buckner, a veteran of the French and Indian War. Buckner served as a captain in the British Army during the Seven Years' War. In 1761, he moved to the Ohio Country to serve as an officer in the Northwest Company.   In 1768, Buckner married Frances "Fanny" Lewis. The couple had seven children: Esther (born ca. 1769), Margaret (born ca. 1772), Mordecai Jr. (born ca. 1775), Lewis (born ca. 1778), John (born ca. 1780), Susannah (born ca. 1783), and Rachel (born ca. 1785).  Buckner became a fur trader in the Northwest Territory and quickly became one of its most successful businessmen. He built a large trading post at Fort Washington near present-day Cincinnati, and he also operated posts at Detroit and Mackinac Island. In addition to trading furs, Buckner also engaged in mineral exploration, founding the town of Bucknersville in the present-day state of Ohio in order to exploit lead and zinc deposits there.   Buckner's business ventures proved to be highly successful, and by the early 1800s he was one of the wealthiest men in America.

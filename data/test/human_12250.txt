The ucode system (written in lower case "ucode") is an identification number system that can be used to identify things in the real world uniquely. Digital information can be associated with objects and places, and the associated information can be retrieved by using ucode. Unique identification system for real world objects is considered an essential enabler for the realisation of Internet of Things  and therefore ucode system is seen as a building block for Internet of Things.   The ucode system uses 128 bit code for unique naming of things so there are 340282366920938463463374607431768211455 or 3.4 x 10^38 different codes. If more codes are needed, they can be added in chunks of 128 bits. Ucode is application and technology agnostic.  Uniqueness means that each ucode is unique, there can â€“ or at least should - not be another ucode with exactly same number. Ucode is not tied to any specific application or business domain, neither is it committed to any specific technology for containing the ucode number, e.g. RFID, barcode or matrix code. ucode is supported by the uID center, which is a non-profit organisation based in Tokyo, Japan.  The Chairman of the uID Center is Professor Ken Sakamura who is also the person behind ucode.

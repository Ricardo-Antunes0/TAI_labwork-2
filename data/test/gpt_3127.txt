Lowell studied at Radcliffe College and then at Columbia University, where she became involved in the feminist movement. After graduating from Columbia in 1886, she taught at several schools before beginning a career as a novelist.  Lowell's best-known novels are The Bluest Eye (1913), which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, and The Great Gatsby (1925), which was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Her poetry often deals with themes of idealism, loss, and love. Lowell died in 1934 at the age of 78.

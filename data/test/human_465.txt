Thomas Peckett (or Preskett) Prest (probable dates 1810â€“1859) was a British hack writer, journalist and musician. He was a prolific producer of penny dreadfuls and was known as a skilled author in the horror genre. He is now remembered as the co-creator (with James Malcolm Rymer) of the fictional Sweeney Todd, the 'demon barber' immortalized in his The String of Pearls, as well as the co-author with Rymer of Varney the Vampire. He wrote under pseudonyms including Bos, a takeoff of Charles Dickens' own pen name, Boz. He also was noted to have a style similar to Dickens. Before joining Edward Lloyd's publishing factory, Prest had made a name for himself as a talented musician. Style  Prest was noted to follow a similar style to Dickens often outright imitating his work like he did with Oliver Twiss. His work was also noticed to not have as strong a narrative or continuity throughout its story, little description and lots of action in order to ensure people would keep returning week after week and not grow bored. He also was noted to avoid the social commentary that Dickens often had as an important element of his work. It is possible he also borrowed idea from French folklore as the character Sweeney Todd has been noted to bear similarities with a popular French folktale at the time of it being published.

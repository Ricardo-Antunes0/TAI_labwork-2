Piazza is a learning management system which allows students to ask questions in a forum-type format. Instructors are able to moderate the discussion, along with endorsing accurate answers. The software was invented by Pooja Nath in 2009 in order to speed response times and create a common place where students could engage in discussion outside of the classroom. Utilizing an extensive notification system and a simple layout, the response time on Piazza averages approximately 14 minutes. Instructors also have the ability to allow students to post anonymously, encouraging more in-depth discussion. The word Piazza comes from the Italian word for plaza—a common city square where people can come together to share ideas and knowledge. History Pooja Nath created the first prototype of Piazza in 2009 during her first year at Stanford Graduate School of Business. By February 2010, Piazza was used by approximately 600 Stanford students. In January 2011, Piazza opened to all institutions, reaching over 330 schools and tens of thousands of students by the summer of the same year.

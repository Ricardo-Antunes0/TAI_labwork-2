Robert Charles Benchley (September 15, 1889 – June 5, 1945) was an American writer and humorist. He is best known for his work as a columnist for the New Yorker magazine, where he wrote prose and verse with a deft touch, and for his celebrated essay collection, The Age of Innocence. Benchley is also noted for his wisecracks, which are famously quoted on bumper stickers and T-shirts.  Benchley was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Charles and Anna (née O'Neill) Benchley. His father was a prominent attorney who served as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts (1901–1904), and as a judge on the Massachusetts Superior Court (1914–1915). Benchley attended The Dexter School in Brookline, Massachusetts, and graduated from Yale University in 1910. He then studied at the Sorbonne in Paris, France.  Benchley worked as a journalist beginning in 1912, when he began writing for the New York World. He also wrote for The Saturday Evening Post (1914–1920), Vanity Fair (1920–1924), and The New Yorker (1925–1945). He was a regular contributor to Collier's Weekly from 1925 to 1929. In 1934 Benchley published an autobiographical book, My Life As an American Writer.  Benchley died from lung cancer at his home in Southampton, New York at the age of 63.

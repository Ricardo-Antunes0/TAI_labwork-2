Oxford Street is a major road in the City of London, England. It runs north from the Strand to Tottenham Court Road, and south from Oxford Circus to Holborn. The name derives from the University of Oxford, whose colleges and administrative buildings line both sides of the street.  Oxford Street was one of the first roads in London to be paved with cobbles, which gave it a smooth ride and made it easier for horses and carts to travel. The street began life as a small track leading from the Thames to the city centre, and was known as Broad Street from its origins until the 17th century. It was renamed Oxford Street in 1667 after the University of Oxford petitioned King Charles II for the favour. The street was widened in the 18th century and today has a wide variety of shops, restaurants, and nightlife.

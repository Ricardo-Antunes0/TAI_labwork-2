Amanda Brown is an American immunologist and microbiologist as well as an associate professor of neurology and neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. Brown is notable for cloning one of the first recombinant HIV viruses and developing a novel method to visualize HIV infected cells using GFP fluorescence. As a principal investigator at Johns Hopkins, Brown studies HIV in the central nervous system, focusing on the cellular role of osteopontin in regulating inflammatory signalling pathways in HIV infected macrophages. Brown also explores how microglia and macrophages serve as latent viral reservoirs in order to target these mechanisms to prevent HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. In addition to her research, Brown mentors and recruits the future cohort of diverse leaders in STEM, serving as director of the Johns Hopkins Neuroscience Scholars Program, and for 10 years serving as program director for the Department of Neurology Johns Hopkins Internship in Brain Sciences Program for Baltimore City High School Students.

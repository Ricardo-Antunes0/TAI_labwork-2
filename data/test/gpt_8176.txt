Dion (; ; 408â€“354 BC), tyrant of Syracuse, was one of the most powerful and influential Greek statesmen of his era. He played a leading role in the first two phases of the Peloponnesian War, and in the middle third he took control of the Athenian fleet.  Born to a noble family in Syracuse, Dion was involved in many public offices before being elected tyrant in 356 BC. His power grew rapidly, and by 353 BC he had conquered most of Sicily and exploited its resources to support Athens' war effort. In 352 BC he made his alliance with the Spartan king Agesilaus II, and in 351 BC he defeated an Athenian army at the Battle of Himera. The following year he concluded the Peace of Apamea with Philip II of Macedon, giving Athens relief from Macedonian campaigns on its southern frontiers.  Dion's tyranny was eventually overthrown by a democratic revolution in 342 BC. After his death, Dion was deified as a god.

The name was introduced to Hungary in the late 12th century by the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos. It became popular in the Slavic world after it was adopted by the Bohemian queen consort Magdalena of Austria in the 15th century. Magda is now widespread in many languages, mainly due to its use by Austrians and Hungarians.

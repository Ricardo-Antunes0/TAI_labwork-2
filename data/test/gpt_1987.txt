In biology, sexual segregation is the differential distribution of sex among organisms. Often, sexual segregation is observed in populations of sexually reproducing organisms, where the sexes are strictly separated. This can manifest as different densities or distributions of individuals of one sex, or different reproductive behavior between the sexes.   Sexual segregation is important in evolutionary biology because it can promote variation and selection for particular reproductive strategies. For example, if two sexes are present in a population, then selection can favor variations in reproductive behavior that result in greater fitness for either sex. In some cases, sexual segregation can also lead to the formation of new species.

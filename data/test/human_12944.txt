Maude Brockway (February 28, 1876 â€“ October 24, 1959) was an American teacher, milliner, and activist. She was born in Arkansas in 1876 and moved to Indian Territory after completing her education at Arkansas Baptist College. Initially, she worked as a teacher around Ardmore, Chickasaw Nation and then opened a hat-making business. In 1910, she moved to Oklahoma City and became involved in the Black Clubwomen's Movement. She was one of the founders of the state affiliate, Oklahoma Federation of Colored Women's Clubs and city chapter, Oklahoma City Federation of Colored Women's Clubs of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs. She served as president of the city chapter from 1925 to 1950 and of the state federation from 1936 to 1940, as well as holding offices in the national organization. In addition to her work with the Federation, Brockway was involved in many church-affiliated organizations, serving in local and state positions. She founded the Oklahoma Training School for Women and Girls, in Sapulpa, Oklahoma and Brockway Community Center in Oklahoma City. The center hosted well-baby clinics, training courses, a daycare center, and the second Black-owned private birth control clinic in the United States. In 2019, the center which bears her name was nominated for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, as a significant marker of black history in Oklahoma.

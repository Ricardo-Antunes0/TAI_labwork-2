Leon Charles Constantine (born 24 February 1978) is an English former footballer who played as a striker. A journeyman of lower league English football, he had 21 separate spells at 19 different clubs within the space of just 12 years. A latecomer to the professional game, he found a Football League club at age 22, and was a regular first-team player for the first time at age 23. Beginning his career as a Millwall reserve following an impressive spell at non-League Edgware Town, in 2002 he joined Brentford. He was unimpressive however and moved on to Southend United the following year, where he proved to be a goal-ever-other-game revelation. In 2004, he enjoyed a short spell with Peterborough United before Torquay United broke their club record in signing him. Again he disappointed, and in 2005 moved on to Port Vale. With Vale he was once more prolific, scoring 32 goals in 72 league games. In 2007 Leeds United were persuaded to sign him, though he fared poorly before transferring to Northampton Town the following year. He spent the 2009â€“10 season at Hereford United, followed by a spell with York City. He left York in 2011 for brief spells at Braintree Town, Lewes, Tooting & Mitcham United, Boston United, Arlesey Town, Brimsdown and then Enfield Borough. In addition to all of these clubs he has also had loan spells with Leyton Orient, Partick Thistle, Torquay United, Oldham Athletic, and Cheltenham Town over the years.

ESTE ARTE is an international art fair that takes place every two years in Barcelona, Spain. The fair is focused on contemporary art from around the world, and it offers a platform for artists to sell their work to a wider audience.  ESTE ARTE was founded in 2003 by Jordi Baylina and Javier Mariscal. The inaugural edition of the fair took place in Barcelona and featured works by artists such as Olafur Eliasson, Damien Hirst, and Yoko Ono. Since then, the fair has grown tremendously in both size and scope, and it now features more than 350 participating artists from 43 countries.  ESTE ARTE is organized by the Fundació Joan Miró i Plàcia and the Barcelona City Council. Thefair takes place over three days in early November each year at the Fira de Barcelona exhibition center. Admission to the fair is free for all visitors.

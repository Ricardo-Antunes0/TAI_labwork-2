Euippe  or Evippe  (Ancient Greek: Εὐίππη; English translation: "good mare") is the name of eight women in Greek mythology:  Euippe, a daughter of Danaus and the naiad Polyxo. She married (and murdered) Imbrus, son of Aegyptus and Caliadne.  Euippe, another daughter of Danaus, this time by an Ethiopian woman. She married either Argius, son of Aegyptus and a Phoenician woman, or Agenor, son of Aegyptus.  Euippe, another name for Hippe, daughter of Chiron.  Euippe of Paionia, the mother, by Pierus, of the Pierides, nine sisters who challenged the Muses and, on their defeat, were turned into magpies.  Euippe (daughter of Tyrimmas). She bore Odysseus a son, Euryalus, who was later mistakenly slain by his father.  Euippe, daughter of Leucon. She bore Andreus a son, Eteocles, king of Orchomenus (not to be confused with Eteocles, son of Oedipus).  Euippe, daughter of Daunus, the king of a people in Italy. She was loved by Alaenus, half-brother of Diomedes.  Euippe, mother of Meriones by Molus. Hyginus referred to her by a different name, which survives in a corrupt form, *Melphis. Notes

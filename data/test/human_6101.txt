Lingua Franca was an American magazine about intellectual and literary life in academia. Founding The magazine was founded in 1990 by Jeffrey Kittay, an editor and professor of French literature at Yale University. Kittay, as the New York Times reported, "saw a niche for vivid reporting about the academic world and especially about its many personal feuds and intellectual controversies." Kittay told the newspaper, "I was an academic who was very, very hungry for information about what made my profession so alive, where people became passionate about abstract ideas." Describing the magazine's impact years later, in the New York Observer, Ron Rosenbaum wrote that "It soon became a much-talked-about phenomenon inside and outside academia." In November, 2000, on the journal's tenth anniversary, the Village Voice commented that "Lingua Franca'''s influence on nineties magazine culture has been so strong, it's sometimes hard to remember that it was unique in academia when it began."

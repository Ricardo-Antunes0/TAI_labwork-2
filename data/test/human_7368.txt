Manuel Ramos (November 20, 1942 â€“ June 6, 1999), nicknamed Pulgarcito (Tom Thumb), was a Mexican boxer and actor.  He was the heavyweight champion of Mexico, a top world title contender in the late 1960s, and one of Mexico's most internationally successful heavyweights. On June 24, 1968, Ramos became the first Mexican to challenge for the heavyweight crown when he fought reigning champion Joe Frazier at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Almost 51 years later, Andy Ruiz Jr., in the same historic venue, made boxing history when he became the first fighter of Mexican descent to capture a heavyweight world title. Biography Manuel Ramos was born in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico.  He boxed professionally for two to three years in the early 1960s, but records of this period have not been preserved.  He defeated Indio Lopez for the Mexican heavyweight title on June 24, 1963 by first-round knockout.  He next fought a series of American opponents in Los Angeles area venues, attaining a mixed record of 5-6-2.

The Organ Mountains (also known as La Sal Range) are a mountain range in southeastern New Mexico, United States. The range extends for about 50 miles (80 km) from northwest to southeast, parallel to the Rio Grande. It is part of the Chihuahuan Desert and is bordered by the Sacramento Mountains to the north and the Gila National Forest to the east.  The Organ Mountains are a relatively young mountain range. They were formed about 10 million years ago as the result of a collision between two large tectonic plates. The southern end of the Organ Mountains is made up of Precambrian and Jurassic rocks, while the northern end is made up of Cretaceous and Paleogene rocks.  The Organ Mountains are home to a variety of plant and animal species, including the Mexican peregrine falcon, sagebrush lizard, and the organ pipe cactus. The range is also a popular recreational destination for hikers, climbers, and skiers.

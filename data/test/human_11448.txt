Hollington is a village and civil parish near the town of Uttoxeter and  from the city of Derby, in the English county of Derbyshire. In the most recent census (2001) Hollington had a population of 212. There are only a few buildings in Hollington of note such as the Red Lion pub to serve the small population. Hollington does have a building of historical importance, a 500-year-old wooden framed house named Lodge Farm; this building currently is a grade II listed building. Location and land use  At last count the village had 84 households with the average house containing over 7 rooms in total. The vast majority of the houses are either detached or bungalows, which is to be expected of a country parish of this size. The other land uses involve mainly agricultural land, though there used to be a Church of England school and a church in the parish.  They have both been closed and the church was converted into a house and privately sold.

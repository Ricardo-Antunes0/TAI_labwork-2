An encyclopedia (American English), encyclop√¶dia (archaic spelling), or compendium is a book or electronic database that is comprehensive in coverage of all aspects of a particular subject. Encyclopedias are divided into different sections which usually contain articles on different aspects of the subject.  Encyclopedias have been published since the early 17th century and their contents have been continually updated. They are often consulted by specialists in a particular field and are used as sources for reference by general readers. Encyclopedias are also used as teaching tools.  The first encyclopedia was the Universal Lexicon, published by the Dutch scholar Jacobus Berentius in 1609. The English language encyclopedia was The Oxford English Dictionary, first published in 1853. In 2004, Wikipedia became the world's largest online encyclopedia with more than 30 million articles.

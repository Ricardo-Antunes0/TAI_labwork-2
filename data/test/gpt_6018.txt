Minertown-Oneva, also known as Minertown, in Forest County, North Dakota, is a ghost town that was founded in 1907. It was located on the banks of the Oneva River about 10 miles north of Forest City. The population peaked at about 150 in the early 1920s, but by the late 1930s it had virtually disappeared.  The town was founded by L.E. Minertown and W.A. Oneva, who were both from the nearby town of Oneva. The name of the town may have been inspired by Minertown, New York, which is also located in Forest County. The first settlers arrived in 1907 and built a small store and a hotel. The population peaked at about 150 in the early 1920s, but by the late 1930s it had virtually disappeared. The cause of its decline is unknown.  Today, only a few buildings remain from Minertown-Oneva. These include the old store, the hotel, and a few homes that have been converted into stores or restaurants. The town is still accessible by road, but it is now almost entirely abandoned.

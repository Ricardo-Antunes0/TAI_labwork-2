The Tax Foundation is a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, founded in 1937 by a group of prominent businessmen in order to "monitor the tax and spending policies of government agencies". The Tax Foundation collects data and publishes research studies on U.S. tax policies at both the federal and state levels. Its stated mission is to "improve lives through tax policy research and education that leads to greater economic growth and opportunity." The Tax Foundation is generally critical of tax increases and high taxation, and is thereby considered fiscally conservative. The Tax Foundation is organized as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit educational and research organization, with three primary areas of research: The Center for Federal Tax Policy, The Center for State Tax Policy, and The Center for Legal Reform. The group is known for its annual reports such as FactsÂ & Figures: How Does Your State Compare, which was first produced in 1941, and its "Tax Freedom Day" brochures, which it has produced since the early 1970s.

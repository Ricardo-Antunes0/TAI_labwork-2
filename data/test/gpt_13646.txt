The Digby Gut is a narrow channel that separates the Magdalen Islands from the rest of Nova Scotia. It is approximately 8 km long and 1 km wide, and is located approximately 10 km east of Digby.  The Digby Gut was first documented in 1758 as a passage between the Magdalen Islands and mainland Nova Scotia. The channel was originally a tidal inlet, but was gradually silted up over the years as the surrounding land rose. In 1918, a dredging project was started to clear the channel of silt, and it was officially recognized as a National Marine Conservation Area in 1990. The Digby Gut is now a popular tourist destination, with boat tours available from Digby Harbour.

The Cluny is a 300-capacity live music venue, pub and café, on Lime Street, in the Ouseburn Valley area of Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Based in a former flax spinning mill, The Cluny occupies part of the wider building at 36 Lime Street, sharing the space with artists, offices and recording studios. The Cluny is a regular fixture in the top 100 list of World's Best Bars, History The building of 36 Lime Street was completed in 1848, when it was opened as a flax spinning mill. The building was commissioned by Messrs Plummer & Cooke and designed by John Dobson. Lasting just 12 years, it was re-opened in 1860 as a steam-powered flour mill by Henry Proctor & Co. At some point in its history, the building became a Scotch whisky bottling plant called the Cluny, hence the current name. In 1982, Bruvvers Theatre Company purchased the building and it became an artists’ space. A section of the building was opened as The Cluny Bar in 1999, and the same space was taken over by The Head Of Steam Limited in November 2002, when its current incarnation came about. The Cluny now operates as a bar and live music venue, with food service provided by The Cluny Kitchen, and 36 Lime Street itself is a Grade 2 listed building

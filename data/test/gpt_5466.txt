Skatteskrapan ("The Tax Scraper") is a 26-storey, 163-meter high building in central Gothenburg, Sweden. It was designed by the Danish architectural firm BIG and completed in 2006. The building is located at Skatteparken, a public square in Gothenburg.  Skatteskrapan houses the Gothenburg Tax Agency, and is the only skyscraper in the city. It was controversial when it was built, as it caused significant environmental concerns.

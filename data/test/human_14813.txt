A feminist stripper is a professional exotic dancer who does not conform to the stereotypes associated with exotic dancers, and instead identifies positively with the identity of stripper. Feminist strippers are sex-positive feminists who view their profession as a choice and a career field. Feminist strippers interact with their profession in a positive manner and view it as a female-centric form of power by asserting their autonomy and by making informed decisions in regard to the regulation of their bodies. The autonomy of feminist strippers is seen through their ability to choose for whom they perform, when they will perform, the content of their performance, and how long it will last. "Since one must exercise control over one's life to be autonomous, autonomy is something that a person accomplishes, not something that happens to persons. But freedom is precisely a combination of self-creation and what happens to you".  There is liberation in the free expression of their sexuality. Becoming a stripper can give a "curious kind of control over those who watched".  Roberta Perkin's work with sex workers showed that they "exerted a significant amount of control over their working lives, felt empowered by their work and most were not arrested or subjected to violence."

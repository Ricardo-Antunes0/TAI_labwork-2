Raymond McCartney (born 29 November 1954) is an Irish former Sinn FÃ©in politician, and a former hunger striker and volunteer of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). IRA membership McCartney took part in the civil rights march in Derry on 30 January 1972, an event widely known as Bloody Sunday. One of his cousins, James Wray, was one of 14 men shot and killed by the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment on that march. As a result of this incident McCartney joined the Provisional IRA several months later. In 1974 Martin McGuinness, who commanded the IRA in Derry, instructed McCartney to beat up an INLA man, Patsy O'Hara, who McGuinness called a "scumbag" and a "hood". On 12 January 1979 at Belfast Crown Court McCartney and another man, Eamonn MacDermott, were convicted of the murder of Detective Constable Patrick McNulty of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, who was shot several times outside a garage in Derry on 27 January 1977. McCartney was also convicted of IRA membership and the murder of businessman Jeffery Agate in February 1977, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The murder convictions were overturned in 2007.

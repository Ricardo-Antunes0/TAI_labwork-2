Old Granada Studios (known simply as Granada Studios from 1968 to 2002) was a major British film studio, located in Granada, North West England.  The studios were founded in 1938 by Sidney Bernstein, who also built the first purpose-built cinema in the UK. Granada Studios produced a wide range of films, from the classics of British cinema such as "The Ladykillers" and "The Third Man", to more recent productions such as "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" and "Shakespeare in Love".  In 2002, Granada Studios merged with two other British film studios, London Film Productions and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, to form The Walt Disney Company's British subsidiary, Disney Studios UK. The studios subsequently ceased production in late 2006.  Granada Studios was registered as a company on 15 October 1938. The first building, Studio A, was opened on 15 November 1938 by Sidney Bernstein with an investment of £100,000 (£10 million in 2007 terms).

In 1940, during World War II, the studios were used to produce propaganda films for the Allied cause.  In 1958, Sidney Bernstein sold Granada Studios to the Rank Organisation for £2 million ($3 million). In 1968, Granada Studios became a wholly owned subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company.  On 10 July 2002, Granada Studios merged with London Film Productions and Metro-Goldwyn-

The Sparse Matrix Converter is an AC/AC converter that uses a sparse matrix representation to achieve better power conversion efficiency.  The Sparse Matrix Converter was developed in order to improve the power conversion efficiency of AC/AC converters. By using a sparse matrix representation, the converter can more effectively use its available energy. This results in improved performance and decreased overall cost.

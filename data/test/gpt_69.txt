Poecilobothrus is a genus of flies in the family Tachinidae. They are found in North America.  The genus Poecilobothrus is composed of a few dozen species of flies, found mainly in North America. They are small and have large eyes, which gives them an appearance that is similar to the tachinid flies. While they share many similar habits and characteristics with other tachinids, Poecilobothrus are unique in that they are known to parasitize other insects, specifically wasps. In some cases, this parasitism can be quite harmful to the host insect and can even result in the death of the wasp.

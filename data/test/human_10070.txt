Death with Interruptions, published in Britain as Death at Intervals , is a novel written by the Nobel Laureate, Jos√© Saramago. Death with Interruptions was published in 2005 in its original Portuguese, and the novel was translated into English by Margaret Jull Costa in 2008. The novel focuses on death, as both a phenomenon and as an anthropomorphized character. A key of the book is how society relates to death in both of these forms, and likewise, how death relates to the people she is meant to kill. Plot summary The book, set in an unnamed, landlocked country at a point in the unspecified past, opens with the end of death. Mysteriously, at the stroke of midnight on January 1, no one in the country experiences death any more. Initially, the people of this country celebrate their apparent victory over mankind's longtime foe. Though the traditional sources for guidance on things like life and death endeavor to discover why people have stopped dying, religious authorities, philosophers, and scholars alike can find no answers. The Catholic Church feels threatened by this new turn of events, as the end of death would call into question one of the fundamental foundations of their dogma: the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. On the other hand, common citizens generally enjoy their newfound immortality.

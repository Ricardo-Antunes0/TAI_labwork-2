Lucien Paul Victor Febvre (, ; 22 July 1878 – 11 September 1956) was a French historian best known for the role he played in establishing the Annales School of history. He was the initial editor of the Encyclopédie française together with Anatole de Monzie. Biography Lucien Febvre was born and brought up in Nancy, in northeastern France.  His father was a philologist, who introduced Febvre to the study of ancient texts and languages, which  significantly influenced Febvre's way of thinking.  At the age of twenty, Febvre went to Paris to enrol in the École Normale Supérieure.  Between 1899 and 1902, he concentrated on studying history and geography.  After his graduation from college, Febvre taught at a provincial lycée, where he worked on his thesis on Philip II of Spain and the Franche-Comté. After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Febvre was forced to leave his teaching post to join the army, where he served for four years. Febvre took up a position at the University of Strasbourg in 1919 when the province was returned to France. While there, Febvre became acquainted with Marc Bloch, who shared Febvre's philosophical and political approach, which brought the two men together.

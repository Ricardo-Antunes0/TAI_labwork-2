The Bris sextant  is not a navigational instrument, nor is it a telescope, but rather a sextant designed for use by navigators in the marine and aviation industries. It consists of a horizontal arm with a set of three graduated circles on its base, and a vertical arm with an index scale at the end. The navigator looks at the index scale to find the angular distance between two points on the horizon.

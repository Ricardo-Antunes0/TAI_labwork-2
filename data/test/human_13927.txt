History  RAJUK Bhaban was established in 1956 as the head office of Dhaka Improvement Trust (DIT). In that time, RAJUK Bhaban was called as DIT Bhaban. It was designed by architect, Abdulhusein M. Thariani, who was a diploma architect of West Pakistan.  Foundation stone was laid on 10 December 1956 by H.E. H. S. Suhrawardy, who was the prime minister of Pakistan in that time. The DIT Bhaban was where the first transmissions of television in East Pakistan have been commenced and has since been the headquarters of the Dacca station of Pakistan Television Corporation, later renamed to Bangladesh Television, and has remained that way even after Bangladesh's independence in 1971. However, in 1975, as the new headquarters have been constructed in Rampura, Bangladesh Television moved all its offices and studios to the new building from the DIT Bhaban. It was renamed as RAJUK Bhaban on April 30, 1987, when RAJUK established by replacing Dhaka Improvement Trust (DIT).

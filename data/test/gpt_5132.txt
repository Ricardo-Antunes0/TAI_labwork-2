Cellulitis is a bacterial infection involving the skin and underlying tissues. It most commonly affects the legs, but can also occur elsewhere on the body. Cellulitis is caused by one or more strains of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, which are commonly found on the skin and in the nose. Treatment typically involves antibiotics to clear the infection and relieve symptoms. Cellulitis is a serious infection that can lead to serious complications, including sepsis (a life-threatening condition caused by infection).

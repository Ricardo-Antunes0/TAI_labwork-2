The 1465 Moroccan revolution was a popular uprising in Morocco against the rule of the Alaouite Dynasty. The rebels, known as the Saadi Revolutionaries, were led by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, a religious scholar and reformer. After a decade of fighting, the rebels overthrew the monarchy and established an Islamic republic.

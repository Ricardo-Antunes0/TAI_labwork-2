Julius Carl Raschdorff (2 July 1823 – 21 January 1897) was a German mathematician who made important contributions to the theory of probability and statistics.  Raschdorff was born in Gera, Thuringia, then part of the Kingdom of Prussia. After studying at the universities of Jena and Berlin, he became a professor at the University of Kiel in 1871. He died in Kiel at the age of 79.  Raschdorff's work in probability and statistics is important for its application to statistical estimation and hypothesis testing. In particular, he developed the Rasedon–Rasch model, which is a fundamental tool in standard regression analysis.

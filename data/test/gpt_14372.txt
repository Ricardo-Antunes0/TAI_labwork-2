Gondwanascorpio emzantsiensis is an extinct Gondwanan scorpion belonging to the family Buthidae. It was described by H. B. S. Sarjeant and A. V. S. Aithal in 2009 from the Late Cretaceous of India.   Gondwanascorpio emzantsiensis is a small scorpion, measuring only 2.9-3.6 cm in length overall and 1-1.5 cm wide at the widest point. It has a pointed snout and a long tail, with a strongly concave back. The carapace is dark green or black, with yellowish markings on the sides and a yellowish spot on the top of the head, behind which is a black stripe that runs down the front of the carapace to the tail. The eyes are large and black, with yellow irises. The legs are short and stout, with claws that are almost as long as the leg itself. The body is covered in short, stiff hairs that give it a bristly appearance.  Gondwanascorpio emzantsiensis is known from only one specimen, which was collected from the Late Cretaceous of India. This species is most closely related to Gondwanascorpio yingi, another extinct scorpion from Gondwana that was described by H. B. S. Sarjeant and A. V. S. Aithal in 2013 from the Late Cretaceous of China.

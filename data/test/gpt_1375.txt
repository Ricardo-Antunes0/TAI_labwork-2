Wolfburn distillery is a Scotch whisky distillery located in the village of Wolfburn, in the Speyside region of Scotland. It is owned and operated by Diageo, and produces whisky that is used in their blends.  Wolfburn distillery was founded in 1795 by Alexander Smith and began production in 1801. It is one of the oldest distilleries in Scotland, and has been in continuous operation since then. The distillery has twice been destroyed by fire, most recently in 1956.

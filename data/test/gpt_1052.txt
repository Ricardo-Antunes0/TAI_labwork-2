Phase-jitter modulation (PJM) is a modulation method in which the phase of a carrier wave is changed periodically, typically using a clock signal. The purpose of PJM is to improve the reliability and performance of communication systems.  Phase-jitter modulation can be used to improve communication reliability by reducing the effects of noise and interference. It can also be used to improve performance by allowing multiple signals to be transmitted over a single channel at the same time.

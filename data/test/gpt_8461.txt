In software engineering, the active record pattern is a software development pattern used to define and manage the relationships between objects in a database. The pattern is named after the Active Record object-relational mapper (ORM) library, which implements it.  The active record pattern allows an object to act as both a model and a controller of its own data. This separation of responsibilities makes it easy to add new data sources or modify existing ones without affecting the object code. The pattern also makes it easy to query and manipulate objects graphically.

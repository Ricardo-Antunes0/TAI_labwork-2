¡Despierta América! (, Wake Up America!) is a Mexican political and social advocacy group which seeks to promote awareness of the United States in Mexico and to encourage Mexican citizens to visit the United States.  The group was founded in 1997 by José Antonio Meade Kuribreña, then the Governor of the Mexican state of México. Kuribreña was inspired to form the group after observing a large number of Mexican students studying in the United States, and becoming frustrated with what he saw as Mexico's lack of interest in its own country.  Since its inception, ¡Despierta América! has actively promoted Mexican tourism to the United States. In 2006, the group organized a mass rally in Mexico City calling for increased immigration from Mexico to the United States. The rally was attended by over one million people, and contributed to a significant increase in immigration from Mexico to the United States that year.  Today, ¡Despierta América! continues to promote tourism and immigration between Mexico and the United States. The group also lobbies for economic and social reform in Mexico.

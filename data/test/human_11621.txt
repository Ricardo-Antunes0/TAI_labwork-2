Gamma Arietis (γ Arietis, abbreviated Gamma Ari, γ Ari) is a binary star in the northern constellation of Aries. The two components are designated γ¹ Arietis or Gamma Arietis B and γ² Arietis or Gamma Arietis A (formally named Mesarthim , the traditional name for the Gamma Arietis system). The combined apparent visual magnitude of the two stars is 3.86, which is readily visible to the naked eye and makes this the fourth-brightest member of Aries. Based upon parallax measurements obtained during the Hipparcos mission, the distance to Gamma Arietis from the Sun is approximately . Properties The double star nature of this system was discovered by Robert Hooke in 1664. The two components have an angular separation of 7.606 arcseconds, which can be resolved with a small telescope. The orbital period of the pair is greater than 5000 years. The brighter component, γ² Arietis, is a Lambda Boötis (chemically peculiar) star with a stellar classification of A1p Si and a magnitude of 4.64. It is classified as an α² CVn type variable star and its brightness varies by 0.04 magnitudes with a period of 2.61 days. The secondary, γ¹ Arietis, is a magnitude 4.58 B-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of B9 V.

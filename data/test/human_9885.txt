This is a list of notable sandwiches. In American English, a sandwich is understood to be a dish consisting of two or more pieces of bread with one or more fillings between them, or one slice in the case of an open sandwich; however, in British English (and some other national English varieties), the definition of sandwich is narrower, requiring a sandwich to be made with bread sliced from a loaf, not other forms of bread such as rolls, buns, bagels or muffins. This list article uses the American definition, so some of the sandwiches listed herein may not be considered sandwiches in other national varieties of English. Sandwiches are a common type of lunch food often eaten as part of a packed lunch. There are many types of sandwiches, made from a diverse variety of ingredients. The sandwich is the namesake of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, a British statesman. Sandwiches can also have notable cultural impact.

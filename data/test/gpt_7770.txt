Dietz v. Bouldin, 579 U.S. ___ (2016), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the use of race as a factor in college admissions decisions.  In Dietz v. Bouldin, the Supreme Court held that using race as a factor in college admissions decisions is constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case arose from a lawsuit filed by white students who claimed that their admission to the University of Michigan was unfairly limited because of their race. The students were rejected based on lower grades and test scores than black students who had applied to and been admitted to the school at the same time. The plaintiffs argued that this difference was due to racial discrimination, and that the use of race in admissions decisions violated their rights under the Equal Protection Clause.  The plaintiffs were unsuccessful in their lawsuit, and the Supreme Court upheld the use of race as a factor in college admissions decisions. The Court found that race is one of many factors that colleges may use in their admissions decisions, and that it is not unconstitutional for colleges to use race as a factor in order to achieve a diverse student body. The Court also ruled that colleges are allowed to use race as a factor in order to furtheriversity, or to promote diversity within the student body.

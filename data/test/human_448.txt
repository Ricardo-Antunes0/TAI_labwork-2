Thomas George Anstruther Molloy (4 October 1852 – 16 February 1938) was an Australian politician. He was a member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly for the electorate of Perth from 1892 until 1894, and thereafter became a perennial candidate, unsuccessfully standing for parliament 14 times. He also served two terms as the Mayor of Perth, from 1908 to 1909 and from 1911 to 1912. Molloy also made a significant contribution to the cultural life of Perth, building numerous hotels and the first two theatres in the city, most notably His Majesty's Theatre, which is still open today. Biography Molloy was born in Toronto, Upper Canada, to John Molloy, a soldier who had served with the Royal Welch Fusiliers in the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny of 1857, and Jane née Curtis. In 1862, they migrated to Western Australia, where John Molloy served as a Pensioner Guard supervising convicts who had been transported from the United Kingdom. Thomas Molloy, meanwhile, attended Christian Brothers College, Perth, and left school at the age of 13 to work at a printing office. He then worked in the cooperative movement with J.T. Reilly, and became manager of the city cooperative store at the corner of Barrack and Murray Streets. By 1870, his successes enabled him to buy the entire block between Murray and Wellington for £900.

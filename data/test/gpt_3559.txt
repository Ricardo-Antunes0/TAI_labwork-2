Richard Brevard Russell Jr. (November 2, 1897 â€“ October 14, 1971) was an American mathematician and philosopher. He is best known for his work in mathematical logic, including the development of the philosophical concept of logical objectivity.  Russell was born in Nashville, Tennessee, on November 2, 1897. He attended Vanderbilt University, where he studied mathematics and philosophy under William James and John Dewey. He obtained his undergraduate degree in 1916 and his graduate degree in 1918.  Russell began his teaching career at Vanderbilt in 1918, and remained there until his retirement in 1963. In 1920 he married Elinor Margaret Evans; they had two children.  Russell's early work focused on mathematical logic and the foundations of mathematics. His most famous accomplishment in this area is the development of the philosophical concept of logical objectivity. This concept states that there is a realm of objects that exist independent of human perceptions and beliefs, and can be studied without reference to any particular perspective or point of view.  Russell also made important contributions to mathematical analysis, set theory, functional analysis, probability theory, and game theory. He has been called "the father of modern analytic philosophy".  Russell died on October 14, 1971.

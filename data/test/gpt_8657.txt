Molecular vapor deposition  is the gas-phase process of depositing a material from a vaporized form on a substrate. It is one of the most common methods of manufacturing advanced materials.  Molecular vapor deposition is an important method for the manufacturing of advanced materials. It is a fast, cheap, and scalable method for depositing materials on substrates. Molecular vapor deposition can be used to deposit a wide range of materials, including metals, semiconductors, and plastic films.

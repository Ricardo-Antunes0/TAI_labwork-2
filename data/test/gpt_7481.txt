Just over the railroad tracks in Old Town Point, sits a small and unremarkable monument to the first Americans. The Arrowhead Monument is a three-sided, flat-topped structure made of rough-hewn sandstone. At its center is a small, natural arched opening that once served as a lookout for early settlers. The monument was erected in 1926 by the Sons of the American Revolution as a tribute to the local Native American tribes who helped early settlers cross the prairies and open up new land for settlement.  The monument is named for the distinctive arrowhead-shaped stones that make up its base. These stones were once used by the local tribes to mark trails and hunting grounds. The Arrowhead Monument is one of only a few monuments in the area that commemorates the contribution of Native Americans to early American history.

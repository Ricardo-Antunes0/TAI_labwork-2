Sean McVay (born January 24, 1986) is an American football coach who is the head coach for the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL). He became the youngest head coach in modern NFL history when he was hired by the Rams in 2017 at the age of 30. McVay is the youngest head coach to win a playoff game, win a Super Bowl, make multiple Super Bowl appearances, and be named the AP NFL Coach of the Year. Within his first year, McVay turned a Rams team that had the league's lowest scoring offense the previous year into the top-scoring team of 2017 en route to a division title. The season also marked the Rams' first winning record since 2003 and first playoff appearance since 2004. Over the following seasons, McVay led the Rams to two Super Bowl appearances and won the franchise's first since 1999 in Super Bowl LVI. His success in Los Angeles is credited with changing NFL hiring philosophies towards younger head coaches.

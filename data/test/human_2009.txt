Thomas Telford School (commonly referred to as TTS) is a City Technology College in Telford, Shropshire and is sponsored by The Mercers Company and Tarmac Holdings Limited. Prior to 2016 the mixed ability school ranked as the top performing comprehensive school in England, and was the first to achieve a GCSE pass rate of 100% A*-C grades. The school was rated by Ofsted as a Grade 1 outstanding school during 2009, and has not been inspected since. History The school was founded in 1991 as the eighth of fifteen specialist CTCs set up to raise educational standards in inner-city areas. The catchment area includes Telford, Wolverhampton and the villages and suburbs in between. One of the school's initial main aims was to help relieve the under-performing schools in the urban areas of Wolverhampton. Thomas Telford School previously generated significant funds through the sale of its online curriculum content and qualifications sold through a subsidiary company TTSOnline Limited (Thomas Telford School Online Limited).

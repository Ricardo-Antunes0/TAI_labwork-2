He served as the head football coach at Kansas State Normal School—now known as Emporia State University—for two seasons, from 1912 until 1913, compiling a record of 9–9.

Crispin had prior experience in football coaching as an assistant coach at Carlisle Indian Industrial School. He resigned the coaching job in 1914 after a proposed pay cut was but forward by the university's board. On November 27, 1914, Crispin married Daisy Burlingame, who had also worked at Kansas State Normal, in the bursar's office in Erie, Kansas. He had been working as an athletics supervisor with public schools in Madison, Wisconsin at the time where he also resided. He later moved to Colorado where he lived until his death in Denver in 1962.

In social psychology, social loafing is the phenomenon where people work less hard than they would if they were working alone. It is often observed when people are working in a group, as opposed to when they are working alone.  The social loafing phenomenon has been studied extensively and has been found to be pervasive in many situations. It is most often observed in tasks that are relatively easy and do not require a lot of individual effort, such as completing a simple task or passing a test.  There are several reasons why people may social loaf. One reason is that it can be easier to take the easy path when working with others. Another reason is that people may feel pressure to conform to the behavior of their fellow workers and may feel like they need to contribute little or nothing to the task at hand.  Social loafing can have negative consequences for individuals and organizations. It can lead to decreased productivity and increased wastefulness, as well as increased risk of accidents and mistakes.

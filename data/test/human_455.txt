Vera is a municipality of Almería province, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. Today Vera is one of the most important commercial centres in the region, with a thriving traditional core and a number of supermarkets and commercial organisations spread along the ring road.  Vera itself lies approximately  inland from the coast, but the municipality extends to the sea shore. There, a tourist settlement, named Vera Playa, has been developed. This now forms the main economic activity of Vera. Since 1990, Vera Playa has developed into an important naturist village. History The earliest Carthaginian, Roman and Moorish settlement was at Baria, by the sea near Villaricos. But in the unsettled times of the early Middle Ages, the settlement was moved inland to the hill of Espiritu Santo, but an earthquake destroyed it in 1518. Following the earthquake it was rebuilt on the site it currently occupies, as a rectangular layout with eight towers and two gates. At the centre was the Parish Church of the Encarnación, built as a fortress to protect the village against pirates. In the late 19th century the town expanded due to mining activity in the region, but it subsequently declined until its recent development as a tourist centre.

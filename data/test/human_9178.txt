Benjamin Cas Haley (born 1980; Paris, Texas) is an American singer-songwriter, who specialises in reggae-inflected music when singing. He rose to national prominence by appearing on America's Got Talent in 2007, finishing as runner-up on that season's competition, whereupon he has conducted several tours and produced several albums during his career with a number of different recording labels. Career Benjamin began his career developing pieces inspired by reggae music. In 2007, he auditioned for the second season of America's Got Talent, conducting several songs with his reggae-inflected music; his first for his audition earned praise from Piers Morgan, a judge for the program at the time, who praised his version of "Walking on the Moon" as being far better than when it had been sung by the musician Sting. His performances earned him national recognition, leading to him finishing the competition as runner-up. After his involvement on the program, he released a self-titled debut album later in the year, reaching No. 8 on Billboard'''s Reggae Albums chart.

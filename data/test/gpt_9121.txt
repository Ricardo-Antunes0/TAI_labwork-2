Avard Longley Davidson (November 2, 1877 – February 1, 1940) was an American artist who is considered one of the foremost painters of the Harlem Renaissance.  Davidson was born in 1877 in Cleveland, Ohio, to James and Sarah (née Longley) Davidson. He was the eldest of three children. His father was a minister and educator, and Davidson was raised in a devoutly Christian household. At the age of twelve, Davidson moved with his family to Harlem, New York City, where he began his artistic training at the School of the Arts. In 1897, he enrolled at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, from which he graduated in 1901.  Davidson's early career was marked by a series of successful exhibitions at major museums and galleries across the United States. He became known for his boldly executed paintings and sculptures that depicted African-American life and culture in a positive light. His work is often associated with the Harlem Renaissance, a period of cultural and artistic revival that occurred in Harlem during the 1920s. Davidson died in 1940 at the age of 64 years old after a long illness.

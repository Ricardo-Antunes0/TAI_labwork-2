Ophisaurus (from the Greek 'snake-lizard') is a genus of large, armoured, herbivorous sauropods. Fossils of ophisaurus have been found from the Late Triassic to the Early Cretaceous periods, and it was one of the largest dinosaurs. Ophisaurus was first described by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1807.  The genus Ophisaurus contains a single species, O. maximus, which is known from a few specimens from the Late Triassic period. It is estimated to have been about 12 meters long and 4 meters wide at the shoulder. The animal's armour made it one of the most heavily armoured dinosaurs ever discovered. The head was protected by a massive skull cap that stretched across the front of the neck and down to the chest. The neck was protected by a thick layer of bone that ran along its length. The body was covered in large plates of armour, which made it very difficult for predators to attack. The plates were made up of small bones that were linked together with fibrous material. This made the armour very strong and resistant to damage.  Ophisaurus was a herbivore that ate plants and leaves. Its large jaw allowed it to eat large amounts of food without having to chew it up. The teeth were arranged in rows along the top of the jaws, which allowed it to grind up plant matter into small pieces. The teeth were also sharpened at the front end, which allowed them to slice through plant matter easily. The animal's thick

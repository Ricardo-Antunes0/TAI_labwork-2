The Toyota Camry (XV50) is a mid-size car produced by Toyota. It was first produced in the Japanese market in 1992, and sales in Japan peaked in 2006 at 1.4 million units. Overseas, the Camry is the sixth most popular car in the world, with cumulative sales of over 20 million units.   The Camry was Toyota's first attempt at a mid-sized car, and was based on the company's Atenza platform. The Camry was called the "Toyota Lexus of its time" due to its resemblance to the Lexus LS 450. The Camry debuted in the Japanese market in 1992 and was originally only available with a V6 engine. In 1995, a V8 engine became available as an option. The Camry competed with the Honda Accord and Nissan Maxima for the mid-size car market share.   In 2006, sales in Japan peaked at 1.4 million units. This was due to the increased popularity of mid-size cars, which were seen as a replacement for larger cars. However, due to the global financial crisis, sales in Japan decreased steadily from 2007 onwards, and by 2012 sales had decreased to just under 600,000 units. Overseas, despite having been released over two decades earlier, the Camry still remains Toyota's sixth most popular car in the world with cumulative sales of over 20 million units. The Camry has been exported to over 130 countries worldwide.  The Camry is available in both a sedan and coupe body style

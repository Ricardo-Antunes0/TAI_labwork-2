The Lyginopteridales were the archetypal pteridosperms: They are the group of plants that includes the ferns, seed ferns and their relatives.   The Lyginopteridales were some of the first land plants to evolve and were some of the most diverse and successful groups of plants on Earth. They are particularly well known for their extraordinary fronds, which can be up to 10 meters long and are made up of thousands of individual leaflets. These fronds are used to capture sunlight and energy from the environment, which is why they are common in areas with high light levels.   The Lyginopteridales are also important contributors to the terrestrial carbon cycle. They produce spores that can travel long distances and colonize new areas, which helps to spread plant diversity and ultimately helps to create new habitats.

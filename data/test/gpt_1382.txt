ZEN was a professional wrestling stable in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) from 2006 to 2009. It was formed by The Dudley Boyz and Edge.  The stable's name is derived from the Japanese martial art of zen budo, which is also the name of WWE's developmental territory, where the members of the stable trained. The stable used zen as a gimmick, with the members often wearing robes and carrying shaku swords.

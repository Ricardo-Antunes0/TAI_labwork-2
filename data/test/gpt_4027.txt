L'Étoile du Déséret was a monthly French comic book series created by Jean Giraud and Pierre Christin.  L'Étoile du Déséret was published between 1972 and 1987. The series is considered to be one of the key works of French comics, and has been cited as a major influence on the development of the Franco-Belgian comics industry.  The series is set in the fictional town of Bourges, located in the Haute-Vienne department in central France. The town is home to a small group of eccentrics, including a witch, an alchemist, and a magician, who are frequently visited by strange characters from all over the world.  L'Étoile du Déséret was initially conceived as a vehicle for Giraud's failed attempt to establish a Franco-Belgian comics magazine called Les Lettres pétillantes. Giraud wrote and drew the first issue himself, using a home photocopier to produce low-quality artwork. The series gradually became more professional over the course of its run, with Giraud and Christin hiring more experienced artists to work on it.  L'Étoile du Déséret was initially published in black and white, but later underwent colorization in order to make it more accessible to a wider audience. The series was later reprinted in digital form, allowing readers around the world to enjoy it without ever having to purchase a physical copy.

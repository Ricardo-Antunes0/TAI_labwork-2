Most of the Afghans in Ukraine are Shiite Muslims who fled the Taliban regime after the United States invasion in 2001. The majority of them live in the city of Kiev, but there are also sizable populations in other major cities including Odessa, Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk. Significant numbers also reside in smaller towns and villages throughout the country.  The main reasons for fleeing Afghanistan were the Taliban's strict religious laws and its campaign of violence against civilians. Upon arrival in Ukraine, most Afghan refugees were initially housed in temporary camps set up near the Ukrainian-Belarusian border. However, as the population grew larger and more permanent housing became available, most Afghans began settling in cities and towns across the country.

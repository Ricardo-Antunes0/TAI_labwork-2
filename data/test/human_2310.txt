G-A-Y is a long-running gay nightclub, based at Heaven in Charing Cross, London. It originally started in 1976, and for many years was based at the London Astoria. History G-A-Y originally began in 1976 in the Sundown club in the basement of the London Astoria (later LA2) as a Monday night event called Bang!. It was started by club promoters Norman Scott, Damien Tony and Jerry Collins, who worked as a DJ under the name Gary London. During the 1980s, Bang! (which had by then also expanded to Saturday night) and Propaganda (Thursday night) were run by gay club promoter and DJ Colin Peters (Peter Daubeney), whose brother Jamie continued as promoter for a period following his death. In the early 1990s, Bang! was acquired by DJ and promoter Jeremy Joseph, formerly employed by Peters, who oversaw its change of name to G-A-Y. At this point, G-A-Y expanded further from two nights a week to four, hosting at the LA2 on Mondays and Thursdays and the London Astoria on Fridays and Saturdays.

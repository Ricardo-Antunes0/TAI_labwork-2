Residual feed intake (sometimes shortened in literature to RFI) is a resource allocation theory index used to calculate the feed efficiency of growing cattle. It was developed by Robert M. Koch in 1963 as an answer to the difficulties of using a feed conversion ratio to compare individual animals. Effective use of RFI data can greatly improve beef cattle farm profits. This approach is based on regression models developed  for determining efficiency of feed use for weight gain during a  standardized growth trial in growing beef cattle. It was inspired by Koch's observations of the differences in how a maintained body weight and an increasing body weight affect the feeding of cattle. His research suggested that feed intake could be broken into two parts:  The expected feed intake for the animal's level of production.  The residual portion between the amount of feed the animal is expected to eat, and what the animal actually eats.

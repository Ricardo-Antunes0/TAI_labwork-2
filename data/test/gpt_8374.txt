The Chronica Naierensis or Crónica najerense (originally written in Latin) is a medieval chronicle of the history of Navarre.   The work is composed of ten books and covers the period from the arrival of the first Christian missionaries in Navarre in the 4th century to 1248. It is an invaluable source for the history of Navarre, providing information on its political, social, and economic life as well as on its culture and literature.   The Crónica najerense was written in Latin by an anonymous author sometime between 1150 and 1198. Its authenticity has been questioned, but it is generally considered to be a reliable source document.

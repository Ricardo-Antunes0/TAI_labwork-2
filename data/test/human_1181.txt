Pennsylvania Route 532 (PA 532) is a  state route located in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area. The route runs from an intersection with U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Northeast Philadelphia north to an intersection with PA 32 in Washington Crossing near the Washington Crossing Bridge over the Delaware River. The route passes through developed areas in Northeast Philadelphia before heading north through suburban Bucks County, serving Feasterville, Holland, and Newtown before coming to Washington Crossing. Most of the portion of PA 532 south of Feasterville was chartered as the Bustleton and Somerton Turnpike in 1840. This road in Philadelphia became known as Bustleton Avenue in 1903. PA 532 was designated in 1928 to run from US 1 in Northeast Philadelphia to PA 32 in Yardley while PA 632 was designated on the route between Newtown and Washington Crossing. In 1946, PA 532 was rerouted to Washington Crossing, replacing PA 632, while the road between Newtown and Yardley became an extension of PA 332. The Newtown Bypass was built in 1977 and PA 532 was routed onto it in 1991.

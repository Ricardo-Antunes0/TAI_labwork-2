Hiran Mitra (born 1945) is an artist and sculptor from India. He is known for his large-scale bronze sculptures of animals and people, which are characterized by their fluidity and movement.  Mitra was born in 1945 in the city of Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh, India. He studied at the National Academy of Fine Arts in New Delhi, where he was taught by renowned sculptors such as R.N. Sankaranarayanan and P.C. Bhagwan. Mitra's early work featured traditional Indian sculptures of animals and people, but he soon began to experiment with new techniques and mediums, creating works that are more fluid and kinetic in nature. His sculptures have been exhibited throughout India, Europe, and the United States, and he has been awarded several prestigious awards, including the Padma Shri (1984) and the Padma Bhushan (1999). Mitra currently lives and works in New Delhi.

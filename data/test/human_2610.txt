A concession stand (American English, Canadian English), snack kiosk or snack bar (British English, Irish English) is a place where patrons can purchase snacks or food at a cinema, amusement park, zoo, aquarium, circus, fair, stadium, beach, swimming pool, concert, sporting event, or other entertainment venue.  Some events or venues contract out the right to sell food to third parties.  Those contracts are often referred to as a concession â€” hence the name for a stand where food is sold. Usually prices for goods at concession stands are greater than elsewhere for the convenience of being close to an attraction, with outside food and drink being prohibited, and they often contribute significant revenue to the venue operator (especially in the case of movie theaters). History Concession stands were not originally operated by the movie theaters, and food was often sold by people attending the film or by vendors outside of the theater.

Rebeca (acronym for Reactive Objects Language) is a reactive programming language that targets the JVM. It is designed to be lightweight, concise, and robust.  Rebeca was created in order to make reactive programming more accessible and more interoperable with existing Java code. It has a modular design, making it easy to combine different reactive libraries.  Rebeca is currently in development and has not yet been released as a standalone language. However, it is being used by several organizations, including Netflix and LinkedIn, in their own projects.

Gabriel Knight is a series of point-and-click adventure games released by Sierra On-Line in the 1990s created by Jane Jensen. The titular character is an author and book store owner in New Orleans who is investigating a strange series of murders when he learns he is descended from a long line of Schattenjägers ("Shadow Hunters"). After undergoing a spiritual trial, Gabriel becomes the new Schattenjäger, called on to stop those who use supernatural methods to threaten others. To signify this, he wears the Ritter Talisman, a protective medallion. Not having supernatural abilities himself, Gabriel mainly opposes his enemies with cunning and insight after investigation and research. In his first game, he is assisted by Grace Nakimura. In the two sequel games, the two act as partners against evil, with Grace now being a playable character. The original 1993 game Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father met with success and popularity, due in part to the voice cast including well-known actors Tim Curry, Leah Remini, Virginia Capers, Mark Hamill, Michael Dorn, and Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. The game was followed by two sequel games that each used a different style of game design: The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery (1995), an interactive movie featuring werewolves, and Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned (1999), a 3D graphics game involving vampires. The first two games met with enough critical success that Computer Gaming World declared Jane Jensen "the interactive Anne Rice". The third game did not reach the same success and wound up being the final game published by Sierra following the decline of the point-and-click adventure video game industry.

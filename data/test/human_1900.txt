Starfield is a Canadian Christian music group from Winnipeg, Manitoba. The group has songs and albums that have charted in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They have won multiple GMA Canada Covenant Awards (Canada's Dove Awards), received four Juno nominations, five Vibes, and the Prairie Music Award for best Christian album. Origins  The band was started by Tim and Jon Neufeld who were leading worship at their small church in Winnipeg. They started out making demos in former members Dave Miller and Adrian Bradfordâ€™s basements, resulting in their first two independent albums Starfield and Tumbling After, which sold more than 20,000 units in Canada alone. "The fact that we sold any CDs to more people than just friends and family, or that we won any awards, still blows my mind," Tim said "we really just thought it would be fun to record some stuff for memory's sake. What has happened is just an amazing testimony to God's faithfulness!" The band's vision in music is: "To lift up Jesus so he is impossible to ignore."

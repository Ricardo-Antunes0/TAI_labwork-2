Swaggering is an ostentatious style of walking affected by someone wishing to assert their dominance.  It is also a form of machismo or sexual display which takes up more space than needed for simple motion.  The exact gait will vary with personality and fashion but it is generally more of a loose, rolling style than a stiff strut.   The feet will be kept apart rather than following each other in line and the more swaggering the gait, the greater the lateral distance between them.  Studies have found that people are able to determine sexual orientation from such cues and a shoulder-swagger was perceived as a heterosexual orientation. Among London cockneys, swaggering was stylised as the coster walk which became the dance craze of the Lambeth walk.  Among African-Americans, it is known as a jive-ass walk or pimp walk.  The actor John Wayne was known for his swaggering walk which became a distinctive element of his screen image.

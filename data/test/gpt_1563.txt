Cyropolis was the largest of seven towns that made up the kingdom of Lydia. It was located on the eastern bank of the Maeander River, in what is now western Turkey.  In 546 BC, Cyropolis was besieged by the Persians under King Cyrus. The town held out for six months until it was relieved by an allied army from Greece.

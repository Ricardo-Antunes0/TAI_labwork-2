The Severan dynasty was a Roman imperial dynasty that ruled the Roman Empire between 193 and 235, during the Roman imperial period. The dynasty was founded by the emperor Septimius Severus , who rose to power after the Year of the Five Emperors as the victor of the civil war of 193â€“197, and his wife, Julia Domna. After the short reigns and assassinations of their two sons, Caracalla  and Geta , who succeeded their father in the government of the empire, Julia Domna's relatives themselves assumed power by raising Elagabalus  and then Severus Alexander  to the imperial office. The dynasty's control over the empire was interrupted by the joint reigns of Macrinus  and his son Diadumenian . The dynasty's women, including Julia Domna, the mother of Caracalla and Geta, and her nieces Julia Soaemias and Julia Mamaea, the mothers respectively of Elagabalus and Severus Alexander, and their own mother, Julia Maesa, were all powerful augustae and instrumental in securing their sons' imperial positions.

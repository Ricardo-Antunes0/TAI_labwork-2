A 3D projection (or graphical projection) is a process of producing a two-dimensional image from data that includes depth information. The most common type of projection is the projection onto a two-dimensional surface (e.g., a screen), but three-dimensional projections are also possible.  A 3D projection can be produced by displaying the data on either a curved or flat screen. To create a realistic three-dimensional image, the projection needs to take into account both the height and the depth of the objects being projected. This is done by drawing images on a screen that correspond to the real objects and their relative positions in space.

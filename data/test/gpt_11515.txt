Chess City (also referred to as City-Chess; sometimes stylized as ChessCity) is a chess game that simulates a battle between two armies. It was designed by Stefan Zink and released in 2006.  The game is played on a rectangular board with a total of 64 squares, each of which can be occupied by one player's pieces. The game can be played by either computer or human opponents. The object of the game is to capture the opponent's king.  The game is played in real time, with each player's pieces moving according to the rules of chess. A player's king can only be moved two squares at a time, and can only be moved forward, not backwards. If a player's king is captured by an opponent's piece, the game is over.

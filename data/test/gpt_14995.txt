Milan Film Festival (MFF), also known as San Sebastian Film Festival, is an international film festival held annually in San Sebastian, Spain. It was founded in 1951.  The MFF is the oldest film festival in the Basque Country and one of the leading film festivals in Europe. The festival has been held annually since 1951, except for 1978 and 1979 due to political reason. Until 2003, the MFF was held twice a year, in April and October. Since 2004, it has been held every year.

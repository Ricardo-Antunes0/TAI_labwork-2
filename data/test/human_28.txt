Kharlamov studied from 1967 to 1972 at Leningrad State University, where he received his Russian candidate degree (Ph.D.) in 1975 under Vladimir Abramovich Rokhlin with thesis Congruences and inequalities for the Euler characteristic of real and projective algebraic varieties (Russian). From 1968, he taught at a secondary school (in addition to research at the university) and from 1976, he was a professor at the university in Syktyvkar. From 1979 to 1991 he was a professor at the College of Electrical Engineering in Leningrad. In 1985 he received his Russian doctorate (higher doctoral degree) with thesis Fourth-degree areas in three-dimensional space (Russian).

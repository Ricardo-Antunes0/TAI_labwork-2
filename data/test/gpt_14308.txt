Trashigang Dzong (, literally "The Fortress of the Trashigangs") is a ruined fortress in Trashigang District, Bhutan. It is located in the Trashigang Valley, about west of the capital Thimphu.  The fortress was built in the 15th century by the Trashigangs, a Hindu-Buddhist tribal community who lived in the valley. The fortress is known for its cliff-top location and its defensive walls, which are up to high and thick. The fortress was abandoned in the 18th century after repeated attacks by the Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal and his forces. Today, the fortress is a popular tourist destination and is used as a filming location for movies and television shows.

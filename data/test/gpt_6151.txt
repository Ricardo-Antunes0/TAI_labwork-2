Ion-Beam sculpting is a two-step process to create a three-dimensional object from a 2D image or model. The initial step is to create a low-resolution outline of the object, which is then refined using an electron beam. The final product is a three-dimensional object that can be manipulated and detailed using traditional sculpting techniques.  Ion-beam sculpting has become an increasingly popular method for creating three-dimensional objects from models or images. The process begins with the creation of a low-resolution outline of the object, which is then refined using an electron beam. This produces a three-dimensional object that can be manipulated and detailed using traditional sculpting techniques. Ion-beam sculpting is particularly suited for creating high-detail objects, as it allows for greater precision than other methods.

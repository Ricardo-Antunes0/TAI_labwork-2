Bandido (born April 17, 1995) is a Mexican luchador enmascarado (masked professional wrestler) who is primarily known for his work in the promotions Lucha Libre Elite (LLE), The Crash Lucha Libre and Dragon Gate (DG). He is currently under a full-time contract with Ring of Honor (ROH) where he is also the current ROH World Champion in his first reign. He is a fourth-generation wrestler, a relative of Apóstol Jr., Myzteziz Jr., and cousin of Magia Blanca. Bandido's real name is not publicly known, which is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico. Bandido previously worked under the ring names "Magnífico II" and "Cielito" but since 2016, he has used the ring character Bandido, who wears a mask that incorporates a bandana covering the lower part of his face in the style of Wild West outlaw. Bandido regularly teams with Flamita, forming a duo known as "Mexa Blood". Bandido currently holds the PWG World Championship and The Crash Heavyweight Championship, and with Flamita and Rey Horus he has held the ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship. He is the winner of PWG's 2019 Battle of Los Angeles, and ROH's 2021 Survival of the Fittest tournaments.

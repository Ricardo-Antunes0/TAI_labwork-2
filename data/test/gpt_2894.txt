The Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) are composed of the Zimbabwe Army, Zimbabwe Air Force and Zimbabwe Navy. The ZDF is headquartered in Harare and is under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Defence.  The Zimbabwe Defence Forces was established on 14 August 1980, following the restoration of democracy in Zimbabwe. The military was initially composed of a small number of poorly trained and equipped soldiers who were mainly used to protect politicians and civilians from political violence. Despite initial concerns, the military has since become an important part of Zimbabwean society and plays an important role in defending the country against external threats. In recent years, the ZDF has been involved in numerous peacekeeping missions overseas, most notably in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi.

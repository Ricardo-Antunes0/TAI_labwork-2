A feminist stripper is a professional exotic dancer who performs in clubs and venues that cater to a primarily male audience. Feminist strippers use their dance skills and sexuality to challenge traditional gender roles and expectations.  Feminist strippers have been performing in the United States and Canada for over two decades. Their work has been featured in magazines, newspapers, websites, and television shows. Feminist strippers have also organized and presented workshops on topics such as personal branding, pole dancing, and performance art.

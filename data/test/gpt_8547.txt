Ski flying is a winter sport discipline of skiing in which a skier or snowboarder rides an aerial lift directly to the top of a ski slope, without stopping at intermediate stops.  Ski flying is an exciting and exhilarating way to ski. It's the fastest way to get from the bottom of the slope to the top, and it's perfect for those who want to get up and down the mountain as fast as possible.  Ski flying is not for everyone. It requires a good level of skiing skills, and it can be dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. But if you're prepared to take some risks, ski flying is amazing fun.

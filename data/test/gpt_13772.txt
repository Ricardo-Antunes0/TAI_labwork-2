Donut County is an indie video game developed and published by Devolver Digital. It was announced at the Spike Video Game Awards 2018 and is set for release in 2019 for Microsoft Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.  "Donut County" is a surreal, psychedelic adventure game set in the fictional town of Sweet Valley. You play as an anonymous protagonist who awakens one morning to find the town besieged by a horde of monstrous donuts. As you explore the town, you must fight donuts off with your bare hands and use your surroundings to your advantage in order to survive.  The game is composed of hand-drawn 2D graphics and features a unique combat system that revolves around using environmental objects as weapons. The game's development was funded through a successful Kickstarter campaign that raised over $2 million.

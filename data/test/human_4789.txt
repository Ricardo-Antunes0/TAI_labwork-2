GeoSafari is a product line of technological educational toys, including the GeoSafari electronic teaching aid, GeoSafari Globe, and the Phonics Lab, owned by Educational Insights, Inc. GeoSafari is an electronic self-teaching device created by brothers Burton and Stanley Cutler, who founded Educational Insights, Inc. in 1962.  Educational Insights, Inc. released the GeoSafari electronic geography teaching aid in 1987, which came packaged with Map Lessons created by the National Geographic Society. It was later re-released by Educational Insights, Inc. in 1990. The system uses two-sided, laminated cards that fit into the front of the machine. The center of the card has numbered elements that correspond to the answers, and the sides of the card have a list of questions or prompts. During game play, the device activates a light next to a random question, and the user types in the number of the answer element. After all the questions are answered, the machine presents a score. Card topics include history, geography, math, astronomy, zoology, anatomy, geology, science, foreign languages, reading, and various others. Several versions were released through the 1990s, but Educational Insights no longer produces the GeoSafari.

Henning Christiansen (28 May 1932 in Copenhagen – 30 January 2006 in Copenhagen) was a Danish composer, conductor and pianist.  Christiansen studied composition at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen with Poul Ruders and Niels Viggo Larsen. He worked as a composer and music teacher before moving to Germany in the late 1960s to teach at the Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe.  He returned to Denmark in 1974 and became chief conductor of the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra. Christiansen also taught at the Royal Danish Academy of Music.  Christiansen's chamber music is often lush and lyrical, drawing on his own experiences as a pianist. He also wrote a number of works for orchestra, including a Requiem, which was commissioned by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra and first performed in 1986.

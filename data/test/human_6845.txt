The Boulevard Gardens Apartments is a 960-unit apartment complex at 54th Street and 31st Avenue in Woodside, Queens, New York City. It opened in June 1935, during the Great Depression. They were designed by architect Theodore H. Englehardt for the Cord Meyer Development Corporation; the design was based on an apartment complex Elgelhardt designed in Forest Hills. History  The housing project had ten units which housed 96 families each, or 960 families in all. The buildings were low-rent model tenements with an average rental price of $11 a room. They were completed with a federal loan of $3,450,000 from the Public Works Administration. Construction started in 1933. Boulevard Gardens was one of seven housing developments funded by the PWA through private companies. Despite the success of the program, future funding went only to public housing authorities. By September 1935 the builders, Boulevard Gardens Housing Corporation, reported that all of the units were leased; a year later, the waiting list was reported to be 5,000 families long.

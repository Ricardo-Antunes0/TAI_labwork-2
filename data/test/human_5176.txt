The Platte Mound M is the letter "M" written using whitewashed stones on Platte Mound about four miles east of Platteville, Wisconsin. It is the largest hillside letter "M" in the world. The letter is  high,  wide, with legs  wide. History University of Wisconsin-Platteville students Raymond Medley and Alvin Knoerr worked at a Colorado mine in the summer of 1936, where they saw a large letter "M" on the side of Mount Zion in Golden, Colorado that stood for the Colorado School of Mines. They believed that a larger "M" should be written on the Platte Mound to represent Platteville miners. They created the first letter on the mound that winter. They wrote the letter "M" in deep snow, and it was visible for several weeks when a cold spell hit the area. The letter "M" was selected for the School of Mines at the university. Several students who went hiking in the same spot after the snow melted used large rocks to build one leg of a letter "M" while resting. The unfinished letter was so pronounced that engineering department head, H. B. Morrow, declared a field day for the department personnel and engineering students to complete the "M". Seniors surveyed the letter to make sure that it was larger than the "M" in Colorado. Underclassmen constructed the letter using borrowed picks, crowbars, and wheelbarrows from a local CCC camp. The letter was constructed from limestone found on the mound. Morrow and other professors drove several miles away to inspect the work from a distance, and they recommended changes to counteract distortion from the slope of the mound. Work was completed about six months later and the letter was celebrated at that year's homecoming on October 16, 1937. It was lit from a torch that was relayed  from the school's Tech building. The illuminated letter was visible from 28 miles away.

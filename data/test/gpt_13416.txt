In theoretical physics, one often analyzes theories by asking what their F-term is. This is a technical term in quantum field theory, denoting the field strength at which the theory breaks down.  In practice, it is not always possible to calculate the F-term for a given theory. However, one can often use the F-term to compare different theories. The F-term can be thought of as a measure of how strongly a theory is coupled to its environment.

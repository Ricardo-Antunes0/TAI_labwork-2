The TMS34010, developed by Texas Instruments and released in 1986, was the first programmable graphics processor integrated circuit. While specialized graphics hardware existed earlier, such as blitters, the TMS34010 chip is a microprocessor which includes graphics-oriented instructions. The processor is a combination of a CPU and what would later be called a GPU. It serves both purposes in a number of high-profile arcade games beginning with 1988's Narc and also Mortal Kombat and NBA Jam. Hard Drivin' (1989) from Atari Games contains two of the processors. The TMS34010 was used in professional-level video accelerator cards for IBM PC compatibles in the early 1990s. The TMS34010 is a bit addressable, 32-bit processor, with two register files, each with fifteen registers and sharing a sixteenth stack pointer. The instruction set supports drawing into two-dimensional bitmaps, arbitrary variable-width data, conversion of pixel data to different bit depths, and arithmetic operations on pixels. Positions in bitmaps can be specified either as X, Y coordinates or as addresses. The TMS34010 is capable of executing any general-purpose program and is supported by an ANSI compliant C compiler. Most of the arcade games that use the processor were written in native assembly language, not C.

Ecological rationality is a particular account of rationality that emphasizes the need to take into account the impacts of one's actions on the natural world. It is sometimes referred to as "environmental rationality", "sustainable rationality", or "naturalism".  Ecological rationality has been influential in the development of environmental ethics, and has been used to critique traditional forms of rationality. It has also been used to develop new forms of rational decision-making that are more sustainable.  The term "ecological rationality" was first coined by Kenneth Boulding in the early 1960s, and has since been used by a variety of thinkers. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in ecological rationality, largely because of the growing awareness of the importance of sustainability.  There is no one definition of ecological rationality, and it is often described as a combination of several different concepts. These include: a concern for the environment; an understanding of how the environment works; an appreciation of the limits to human knowledge; and a commitment to using rational decision-making when making decisions about how to interact with the environment.

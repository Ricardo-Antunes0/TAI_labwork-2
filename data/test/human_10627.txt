The episode focuses on Dr. Rush working on modifying the chair interface, so that he can use it in an attempt to gain access to the master code while replaying the memories during his wife's dying days. The episode was viewed by 1.3 million Americans and was generally well received. Plot Dr. Nicholas Rush (Robert Carlyle) uses the Ancient repository chair, which was previously used by Jeremy Franklin, who almost died using it. Rush devises a program which allows the chair to download the information slowly, and works out how to crack the master code to finally gain control of Destiny. He replays the memories from when his wife, Gloria (Louise Lombard), was dying from cancer, and when Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) recruited him to the Stargate program. When Rush finds the master code, he will exit the program. In the meantime, Colonel Young (Louis Ferreira) learns of this and considers disconnecting him if Rush's life is threatened. As Rush is about to give up, he realises a recurring element popping up everywhere; the number 46. When he visits Gloria at her death bed, she reveals that the number is a reference to Human genetics; 46 is the normal number of chromosomes for humans. After disconnecting himself from the chair, Rush writes a program to crack the master code, which is a specific gene used by the Ancients.

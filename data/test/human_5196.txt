The Milford Congregational Church is a historic church on Main and Ferry Streets in Milford, Maine.  Built 1883â€“85, this Queen Anne Victorian structure is one of the most architecturally sophisticated buildings in the small town.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Milford Congregational Church is located at the northwest corner of Ferry Street and Main Street (United States Route 2), near the northern edge of the town's village center.  It is a roughly rectangular -story wood-frame structure, with a square tower at its southeastern corner.  Its exterior is finished in a variety of clapboarding and cut wood shingles typical of the Queen Anne period. A modern addition extends to the west (along Ferry Street).  The east facade has a large stained-glass round-arch window, with the entrance set at the base of the tower to the left.  The tower has buttress forms on its south side, and a second stage with half-round windows, above which is a belfry stage with paired round-arch openings, topped by a pyramidal roof.

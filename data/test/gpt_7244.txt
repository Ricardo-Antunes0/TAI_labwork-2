Gottschee  refers to a former German-speaking province in the north-eastern part of the present-day Slovenia. The province included the modern municipalities of Gottschee, Krško, and Dolenjske Toplice. The name Gottschee is derived from the Slovene words "got" (a meadow) and "šče" (a clearing).   Gottschee was incorporated into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1919. After World War II, it became a part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 1991, following the disintegration of Yugoslavia, Gottschee became part of the newly independent Slovenia.

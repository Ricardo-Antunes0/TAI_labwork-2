Shaun Patton (born 1995) is an Irish goalkeeper who has played in that position in two different sports. A former professional soccer player in the League of Ireland with Derry City, Finn Harps and Sligo Rovers, Patton changed to Gaelic football in 2018, playing for St Eunan's and the Donegal county team. He has twice won the Ulster Senior Football Championship with Donegal. Early life Patton is from Letterkenny. He went to primary school at Lurgybrack in Letterkenny. He attended St Eunan's College for his secondary education. Patton played in a MacLarnon Cup Final for the college. He did so while on the books of Finn Harps, a soccer team. His teammates on an earlier St Eunan's College team (when Patton was 14) included future professional footballer Dale Gorman. He also played for the Republic of Ireland at schoolboy level. He made his League of Ireland debut at the age of 16 before becoming disillusioned with that game at the age of 22 and pursuing Gaelic football instead. He did not attend a third-level institution as he was playing full-time football. He joined Derry City in November 2014 in what was considered a surprise development, though he had lost his position in the Harps team after taking time off to study for his Leaving Certificate the previous year. Michael Murphy employed Patton to work in his shop in Letterkenny. Patton came out as a Garda in 2020. He was posted to Navan, a town in County Meath.

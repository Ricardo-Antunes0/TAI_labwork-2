In mythology and literature, a werewoman or were-jaguar is a female who has the power to transform into a jaguar, typically as a result of a curse or ritual.  Werewomen have been described in various cultures around the world, and their powers vary. In some cases, werewomen are revered for their strength and ability to protect others; in others, they are feared for their predatory nature. There is no one definition of a werewoman, and their characterization varies depending on the culture and storyteller.

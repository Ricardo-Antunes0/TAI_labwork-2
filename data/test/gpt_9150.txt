The Ariel-class gunboat was a class of three Royal Navy gunboats. The first two were built in the 1930s, and the third was completed in 1942. They were armed with guns in single mounts and could carry a crew of fifty-four men.  The Ariel-class gunboat was designed as a fast patrol boat intended to counter the threat posed by larger German warships. They were constructed with a steel hull and an aluminium superstructure, and were powered by two diesel engines. They had a range of approximately 150 miles and were armed with four 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes.  The Ariel-class gunboats saw limited service during World War II. They participated in the Battle of the Mediterranean, the Battle of Cape Spartivento, and the Battle of Crete. After the war, all three vessels were decommissioned and sold for scrap.

Ion-Beam sculpting is a two-step process to make solid-state nanopores.  The term itself was coined by Golovchenko and co-workers at Harvard in the paper "Ion-beam sculpting at nanometer length scales."  In the process, solid-state nanopores are formed by lateral mass transport about the surface of the substrate, not simply by sputtering, which is the removal of material from the surface. Basis The first step in ion sculpting is to make either a through hole or a blind hole, most commonly using a focused ion beam (FIB).  The holes are commonly ~100Â nm, but can be made much smaller.  This step may or may not be done at room temperature, with a low temperature of -120 C.  Next, there are three common techniques to now 'sculpt' the hole: broad area ion exposure, TEM exposure, and FIB exposure.  Holes can be closed completely, but also they can be left open at a lower limit of 1 - 10 nm.

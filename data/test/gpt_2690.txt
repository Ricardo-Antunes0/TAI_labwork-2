The gold dollar or gold one-dollar piece was the first United States coin struck in 1794. It was made of gold and had a face value of one dollar. The name "gold dollar" is derived from the Spanish word "dolares," which means "gold pieces."   The gold dollar was superseded in circulation by the gold eagle in 1849. Today, gold dollars are used as collector's items or for investment purposes.

Ludwig Diels, the German botanist who first formally described the species using the basionym Unonopsis polyphleba, named it after the distinctive veins (Latinized form of Greek , phl√©ba) in its leaves.

The leaves are hairless on their upper and lower surfaces, but can have small warty bumps.  The leaves have 10-15 distinct, straight secondary veins emanating from the primary vein.  Its petioles are 2-7 millimeters long. Its flowers are solitary or in pairs and axillary. Each flower is on a pedicel 2-5 millimeters long. Its flowers have 3 oval-shaped sepals that are 1-2 by 2-3 millimeters.  The outer surface of the sepals is hairless or slightly hairy. Its 6 petals are arranged in two rows of 3. The outer petals are white to yellow and 4-10 by 3-5 millimeters.  The outer petals are hairless on their outer surface. The inner petals are similarly colored and 3-8 by 3-5 millimeters. The inner petals are smooth on their outer surface. It has numerous stamens that are 1.5-1.7 millimeters long.

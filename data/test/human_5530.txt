Karma Automotive is an Chinese producer of luxury electric vehicles founded in 2014. Headquartered in Irvine, California, United States with an assembly plant located in Moreno Valley, Karma sells vehicles via its dealer network of locations in North America, Europe, South America, and the Middle East. History In February 2014, Chinese auto-parts supplier Wanxiang Group purchased assets of Fisker Automotive for $149.2 million in a bankruptcy auction. These assets included designs, a plug-in hybrid powertrain, and the former Wilmington Assembly factory in Wilmington, Delaware. Fisker Automotive was founded in 2007 by Henrik Fisker and his business partner Bernhard Koehler. Its Fisker Karma plug-in hybrid sports sedan debuted in 2011, and about 2,000 of the vehicles were sold. After Fisker's battery supplier A123 Systems filed for bankruptcy after two battery recalls, Fisker Automotive could not continue its business operations, and the company declared bankruptcy in February 2014 which led to the Wanxiang acquisition. The purchase excluded the Fisker brand and trademarks owned by Henrik Fisker. Wanxiang also purchased A123 Systems following its bankruptcy declaration.

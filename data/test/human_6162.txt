The sagebrush lizard, or sagebrush swift, (Sceloporus graciosus)  is a common species of phrynosomatid lizard found at mid to high altitudes in the western United States of America.  It belongs to the genus Sceloporus (spiny lizards) in the Phrynosomatidae family of reptiles.  Named after the sagebrush plants near which it is commonly found, the sagebrush lizard has keeled and spiny scales running along its dorsal surface. The sagebrush lizard is similar to the western fence lizard, another Sceloporus species found in the western US.  The sagebrush lizard can be distinguished from the western fence lizard in that the former is on average smaller and has finer scales. The keeled dorsal scales are typically gray or tan, but can be a variety of colors.  The main (ground) color is broken by a lighter gray or tan stripe running down the center of the back (vertebral stripe) and two light stripes, one on either side of the lizard (dorsolateral stripes). S. graciosus will sometimes have orange markings on its sides.

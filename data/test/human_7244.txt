Gottschee  refers to a former German-speaking region in Carniola, a crownland of the Habsburg Empire, part of the historical and traditional region of Lower Carniola, now in Slovenia. The region has been a county, duchy, district, and municipality during various parts of its history. The term often also refers to the entire ethnolinguistic enclave regardless of administrative borders. Today Gottschee largely corresponds to the Municipality of Kočevje. The original German settlers of the region are called Gottschee Germans or Gottscheers, and their German dialect is called Gottschee German or Gottscheerish. Geography The Gottschee enclave encompassed a roughly oval-shaped area between 45° 46′ N and 45° 30′ N, and between 14° 36′ E and 15° 9′ E. Geographers divided the enclave into seven regions based on valleys (from west to east):  The Suchen Plateau  in the extreme west, with the (pre-1933) municipalities of Obergras and Suchen;  The Back District  in the west, with the municipalities of Göttenitz, Hinterberg, Masern, Morobitz, Rieg, and Tiefenbach;  The Upper District  in the central area, with the municipalities of Lienfeld, Mitterdorf, and Seele, plus the city of Gottschee ;  The Lower District  in the south-central area, with the municipalities of Graflinden, Mösel, Schwarzenbach, and Unterlag;  The Forest District   in the north-central area, with the municipalities of Altlag, Ebenthal, Langenton, and Malgern;  The Tschermoschnitz District  in the northeast, with the municipalities of Pöllandl, Stockendorf, and Tschermoschnitz;  The Lower Side  in the southeast, with the municipalities of Nesseltal and Unterdeutschau.

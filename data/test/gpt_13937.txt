Bonaparte's gull (Chroicocephalus philadelphia) is a member of the gull family. It breeds on the Atlantic coast of North America, from Newfoundland to Florida, and winters in the Caribbean and Central America.  This large gull is mainly white with a black head and wings, and a black tail. It has a long neck and a slightly curved bill. The sexes are similar, but the female is larger and has a more extensive black moustache. Juveniles are mostly brown with a white throat, but become mostly white with age.  This gull is mainly scavenger, feeding on scraps from food sources such as fishing boats or land-based restaurants. It also takes advantage of garbage dumps and other areas where food is available.

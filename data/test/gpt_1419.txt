The Battle of Changping  was a major battle fought during the Second Sino-Japanese War, part of the Battle of Shanghai. The battle took place on July 14 and 15, 1944, in Changping County, near Shanghai. The Japanese 5th Army, led by Lieutenant General Seishiro Itagaki, fiercely defended the city against the 2nd Chinese Army, commanded by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. The battle resulted in a decisive victory for the Japanese forces, who were able to keep control of Shanghai even after the city fell to the Allied Forces on December 9, 1944.  After weeks of intense fighting and street-by-street combat in Shanghai, the Allies had finally broken through Japan's defenses and occupied the city on December 9th. However, Japanese troops still held out in key positions around Shanghai such as the military district of Changping. The 2nd Chinese Army was assigned to take Changping and break through the Japanese lines, but they were met with fierce resistance from the 5th Army.  The battle raged over a two-day period and resulted in heavy casualties on both sides. The Japanese eventually emerged victorious and were able to hold onto Changping even after Shanghai fell to Allied Forces. This battle was one of the most important in terms of determining the fate of Shanghai and marked a turning point in the war against Japan.

Onehundredhours (also known among fans as '100h', or 'the hours') were a Christian rock band, headed by Tré Sheppard. History The band initially started by accident an initial one-off gig, when Tré was asked to lead worship at a youth Cell-Church conference in 1997, which resulted in their first tour, of California after they were invited by the conference speakers. Following this, the band released 2 independent records, which sold in excess of 16,000 copies. Onehundredhours were then signed up by the Christian record label Survivor. Since then, another 2 albums have been released, assisting in the growth of the band's popularity, in the UK and also within Europe, where many tours have taken place. They are also regular guests to Spring Harvest and Soul Survivor festivals, as well as New Wine. In 2005, Onehundredhours supported Daniel Bedingfield on his UK & European tour.  Daniel, a long-time friend of Onehundredhours, gave a personal invitation for the band to guest on the tour. In 2006, the band toured throughout the UK, touring with Tree63 on their UK dates in December. Furthermore, on 11 May 2008 Onehundredhours played at the Astoria Theatre as part of the 'Live at the Court' celebration, which made up a number of events in the London-wide Pentecost festival. They shared the stage on this occasion with The Gentlemen, Electric Church and headliners Salvador. In 2009, the band played their last gig at Soul Survivor Week C.

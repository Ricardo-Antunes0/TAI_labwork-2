Blandfordia, commonly known as Christmas bells, is a genus of about 20 species of flowering plants in the bellflower family, Asteraceae.  The genus Blandfordia is endemic to New Zealand. The species are variable in shape and size, but all have a number of erect, fragrant flower heads with large, showy yellow or orange disc florets. They are found in temperate to sub-tropical regions of the North and South Islands.  The species are deciduous or nearly so, and range in height from a few centimetres to several metres. The bell-shaped flowers are borne singly or in small clusters on long stalks. The foliage is typically sparse, but the leaves are often finely divided into lobes or narrow leaflets.

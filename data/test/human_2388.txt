William Leonard Laurence (March 7, 1888 – March 19, 1977) was a Jewish American science journalist best known for his work at The New York Times. Born in the Russian Empire, he won two Pulitzer Prizes. As the official historian of the Manhattan Project, he was the only journalist to witness the Trinity test and the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. He is credited with coining the iconic term "Atomic Age," which became popular in the 1950s. Early life and career Laurence was born Leib Wolf Siew in Salantai, a small city in the Russian Empire that is now in Lithuania. He emigrated to the United States in 1905, after participating in the Russian Revolution of 1905, and he soon changed his name, taking "William" after William Shakespeare, "Leonard" after Leonardo da Vinci, and "Lawrence" after a street he lived on in Roxbury, Massachusetts (but spelled with a "u" in reference to Friedrich Schiller's Laura). Although he attended Harvard University (1908–1911; 1914–1915) and allegedly completed all coursework for his undergraduate degree, Laurence maintained in a later Columbia University oral history that it was not conferred due to a personality conflict with the dean of Harvard College. Following additional studies at the University of Besançon (1919) and Harvard Law School (1921), he ultimately received his LL.B. from the Boston University School of Law in 1925. He became a naturalized US citizen in 1913. During World War I, he served with the US Army Signal Corps.

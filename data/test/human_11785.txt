Sirois had only one point in two and a half seasons of work for the IceCats and moved to the ECHL with teams such as the Baton Rouge Kingfish and the Jacksonville Lizard Kings. He then moved to a more permanent job in the league with the Pee Dee Pride of Florence, South Carolina (his one-year stint with the Florence Pride is not a change of teams, but a name change by the franchise). He produced fifty points in all but one season, and surpassed the 500 point mark for his career before the Pride ceased operations in April 2005. He remained in South Carolina the following season to play for the Greenville Grrrowl. He produced 48 points for the Grrrowl in 2006. He later spent time with the Pee Dee Cyclones, Texas Wildcatters and Twin City Cyclones, last playing in 2008–09.

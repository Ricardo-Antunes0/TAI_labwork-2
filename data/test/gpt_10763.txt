Worldwide media use the term colour revolution to describe the transitions from authoritarian rule in some countries during the late 1980s and early 1990s to more democratic systems.  The term refers to movements in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa that aimed to change government policies, dismantle state-owned industries, and promote free market economies. Regional factors such as religion, ethnicity, and language also played a role in these revolutions.  The first wave of colour revolutions began in earnest in December 1989 with the fall of the Berlin Wall. They later spread to countries such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Romania and Bulgaria. The second wave began in 2003 with the overthrow of Suharto in Indonesia and continued until 2005 with the ouster of President Thabo Mbeki in South Africa.

This article is about education in Seychelles and its evolution from private mission schools to compulsory public education in the modern system. History Until the mid-19th century, little formal education was available in Seychelles. Both the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches opened mission schools in 1851. The missions continued to operate the secondary schools — Seychelles College run by the Brothers of Christian Instruction and Regina Mundi Convent run by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny — even after the government became responsible for education in 1944, though primary schools were established throughout the islands with mainly untrained teachers. After a teacher training college opened in 1959 'to cater for in-service teachers of promise without previous training, and to train new entrants to teaching' (quote from article by S. Quinlan: "The Teacher Training College" in Seychelles Government Bulletin, July 27, 1961) a two-year training course was offered for secondary teachers or a one-year course for in-service primary teachers, resulting in a supply of locally trained teachers becoming available. Since 1981 a system of free education has been in effect requiring attendance by all children in grades one to nine, beginning at age five. Formerly, school-age children were required to participate in the National Youth Service (NYS).

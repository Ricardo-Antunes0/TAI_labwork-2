The Beacon Building is an office building in London, England that was designed by Norman Foster and completed in 1987. The building is a prominent landmark on the banks of the River Thames, and is the headquarters of the European Medicines Agency.  The Beacon Building was conceived as a modernist icon, and has been described as one of Foster's finest works. The building comprises a series of stacked tubes, with an internal atrium connecting them. The design was controversial at the time of its construction, with many deeming it an eyesore. Since its completion, however, the building has come to be regarded as one of London's most iconic structures.  The Beacon Building is currently owned by the state-owned French insurance company Axa and managed by property company Landmark Properties.

The Republican National Convention (RNC) is a United States political convention of the Republican Party. The purpose of the RNC is to nominate a candidate for President of the United States, and to determine the party's platform and direction.  Since the 1952 Convention, which nominated Dwight D. Eisenhower, the convention has been held in cities across the U.S., typically in late summer or early fall. The 2012 Convention was held in Tampa, Florida, from August 27 to August 30.  The 2016 RNC was held in Cleveland, Ohio from July 18-21.

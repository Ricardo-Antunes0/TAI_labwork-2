Maria Elisabeth "Maja-Lisa" Borgman (1750s – 14 September 1829) was a Swedish opera singer and the first lady of the Royal Swedish Opera.  Born in Stockholm, Sweden, Borgman was the daughter of the court musician Johan Fredrik Borgman and his wife Catharina Charlotta Lagerström. She studied singing with her father and made her professional debut at the age of thirteen in 1768 as Rosina in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Don Giovanni at the Royal Swedish Opera. She quickly established herself as an opera star, appearing in a wide range of roles both in Sweden and abroad. Her most famous roles included Violetta in Verdi's La traviata, Elisabeth in Ludwig van Beethoven's Fidelio, and Aida.  Borgman retired from performing in 1827 and later served as the first lady of the Royal Swedish Opera. She died in Stockholm aged 82 years.

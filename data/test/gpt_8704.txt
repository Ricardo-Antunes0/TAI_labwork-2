In digital electronics, a level shifter, also known as a voltage-level shifter or voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA), is an electronic device that allows a higher voltage to be applied to a circuit node (typically a speaker) than the voltage applied to the node by the input signal.  The level shifter allows the output of the circuit to stay within the range of the input signal, even if the input signal is above or below the nominal voltage of the circuit. This is important in loudspeaker applications, where a sudden increase or decrease in power can cause damage to the speakers.

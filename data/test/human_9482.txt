Murari Sharma (Hindi: मुरारी शर्मा), (1 January 1901 – 2 April 1982) was an Indian revolutionary who took part in the Kakori Conspiracy and absconded away. Police could not trace him out as Murari Sharma was his fake name. His actual name was Murari Lal Gupta. While speaking as a Chief Guest this fact was disclosed by his son Damodar Swarup 'Vidrohi' - a revolutionary poet of Shahjahanpur district in the "Ram Prasad Bismil Jayanti Sangoshthi" organised by Hindi Academy Delhi on 19 June 1997 at Rajendra Bhawan New Delhi. He was born on 1 January 1901 to Chhote Lal Gupta a khandsari (en. sugar producing business man) of village Mudia Panwar in Shahjahanpur district of Uttar Pradesh. For some times he lived underground in Delhi and later on returned to his native village. He died natural death on 2 April 1982 in his house of Shahjahanpur at the age of 81. He never sat on a Rikshaw throughout his life, for the reason that it was pulled in the city by a man, and being a man himself he considered it unethical to be pulled by a man.

The Trinity Carol Roll is a 15th-century illuminated manuscript with religious motifs. It is the oldest extant surviving roll of a carol and is one of the most important early works of German illuminators. The text and images are probably based on an earlier illuminated manuscript, the Trinitatis Carolus, which is now lost. The Trinity Carol Roll was created in Konstanz in southern Germany, probably in the 1440s or 1450s. It is one of the earliest known examples of German secular illumination, and features lively and intricate image decoration in the style of Burgundy painting.   The roll was acquired by the British Museum in 1872, and has since been exhibited in several venues around the world, including the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Rijksmuseum. It remains one of the museum's most popular objects, and has been described as "the Pearl Necklace of art".

The  is a full-size luxury sedan manufactured by Lexus. It was introduced in 1989 as a replacement for the Lexus LS400. The LS is available in both coupé and sedan bodystyles.  The Lexus LS was designed to compete with the most prestigious sedans on the market at the time, such as the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, BMW 7 Series, and Audi S8. The LS has been described as "the perfect car for the perfect person."  The LS is available in both coupé and sedan bodystyles. The coupé has a long, sleek body with a large rear window and a fastback roofline. The sedan has a shorter, more traditional body style with a shorter rear window and a more conventional roofline.  The LS is powered by a V8 engine that produces 350 horsepower (269 kW). It is available with either a 5-speed manual or an electronically controlled automatic transmission. The LS can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (96 km/h) in 4.2 seconds and can reach a top speed of 155 mph (249 km/h).  The Lexus LS has received several awards, including Motor Trend's Car of the Year for 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1995, and Automobile Magazine's Car of the Year for 1998. It has also been awarded Five-Star ratings by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for each of its first five model years.

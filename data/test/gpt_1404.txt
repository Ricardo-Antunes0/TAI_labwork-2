Green For All is an organization whose mission is to promote environmental justice by working to create environmental policies and practices that are fair, unbiased, and inclusive for people of color and low-income communities.  The term "environmental justice" has been used to describe the disproportionate impact that pollution, social injustice, and idleness have on people of color and low-income communities in the United States. This is in part because these groups are more likely to live in areas with contaminated air, water, and soil.  Green For All was founded in 2001 by Dr. Alondra Oc√≥n-Carrion and Dr. Jodi Jacobson. The organization's goal is to create environmental policies and practices that are fair, unbiased, and inclusive for people of color and low-income communities. To this end, Green For All works to educate policymakers, advocates, and the public about the importance of environmental justice.   Green For All has worked with a variety of partners to achieve its goals. These include the NAACP, the Sierra Club, Environmental Justice Action Network (EJAN), Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), 350.org, and the United Church of Christ. In addition, Green For All has collaborated with academics such as Dr. Laura Miller from UC Berkeley and Dr. Adrienne Shaw from Brown University.   The organization has also worked to create policy change through its lobbying efforts. In 2012, Green For All submitted a proposal to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA

A timesheet (or time sheet) is a method for recording the amount of a worker's time spent on each job. Traditionally a sheet of paper with the data arranged in tabular format, a timesheet is now often a digital document or spreadsheet. The time cards stamped by time clocks can serve as a timesheet or provide the data to fill one. These, too, are now often digital. Timesheets came into use in the 19th century as time books. To record time in a more granular fashion time-tracking software may be used. Use Originally developed for an employer to calculate payroll, timesheet can also be used for management accounting. Timesheet may track the start and end time of tasks or just the duration.  It may contain a detailed breakdown of tasks accomplished throughout the project or program.  This information may be used for payroll, client billing, and increasingly for project costing, estimation, tracking, and management.

Paul Otto Manz (May 10, 1919 â€“ August 10, 1993) was an American physicist who made important contributions to the theory of elementary particles and their interactions.  Manz was born in Chicago, Illinois, on May 10, 1919. After graduating from high school in 1938, he attended the University of Chicago, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1941 and his doctorate in 1945. He then joined the Manhattan Project at the University of California, Berkeley, where he worked on the development of the atomic bomb. In 1952 he became a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  Manz's research focused on the theory of elementary particles and their interactions. He is particularly remembered for his work on quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is one of the four main theories in particle physics. In this field, Manz developed a comprehensive theory of the strong interaction between quarks. His work has led to a better understanding of some of the most fundamental principles governing the behavior of matter.  Manz died on August 10, 1993, in Santa Cruz.

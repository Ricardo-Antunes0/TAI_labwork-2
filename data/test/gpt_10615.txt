Transketolase (abbreviated as TK) is an enzyme that catalyzes the ketolysis of acetoacetate to form acetone and CO2.  Transketolase is an important enzyme in ketone body metabolism. It catalyzes the ketolysis of acetoacetate to form acetone and CO2, two molecules of carbon dioxide. This reaction is necessary for the biosynthesis of energy in the body from glucose, and is also involved in the degradation of junk food. Transketolase is found mainly in tissues that need to produce large amounts of ketones, such as the liver and muscles. In addition, transketolase is responsible for the degradation of a number of drugs and toxins.

Modesta Sanginés Uriarte (26 February 1832 – 16 November 1886) was a Spanish painter and lithographer.  Born in Madrid, Sanginés Uriarte studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando between 1851 and 1857, under Francisco de Goya and Mariano Benlliure. He won the third prize in the National Exhibition of Fine Arts in 1856 with his painting "Padre Damián". The following year, he moved to Paris, where he continued his studies at the Académie Julian.   In 1862, Sanginés Uriarte returned to Madrid and exhibited at the Salón de Arte Reina Sofía. He also began teaching at the Academy of Fine Arts, where he served as a professor until his death. Among his students were Francisco de Goya y Lucientes, Fernando Botero, José Mariátegui and José Rodolfo Castillo.   Sanginés Uriarte is best known for his romantic paintings of rural landscapes, often featuring pastoral scenes or depictions of Spanish folk culture. His work has been compared to that of Caspar David Friedrich and J. M. W. Turner.

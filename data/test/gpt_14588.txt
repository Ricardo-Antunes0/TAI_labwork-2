LOCC, or local operations and classical communication, is a protocol specification for the transmission of real-time audio, video, and text over local networks. It is designed to provide low-latency, high-quality communication between devices that are close to each other.  LOCC was first proposed in 2008 by Rohan Narayan, Pramod Madhavan, and Sanjay Sarma. It has since been adopted by a number of groups, including Apple Inc., Google Inc., and Microsoft Corporation. LOCC is not yet an official IETF standard, but there are plans to make it one.

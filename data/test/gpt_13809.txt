Tracking stock, also known as letter stock, is a stock market technique that uses letters to represent shares of a particular company.  Tracking stocks is a technique that was first used in the early days of the stock market. At the time, there were not many electronic ways to track stocks, so tracking stocks involved physically tracking the stock certificates of different companies. Today, tracking stocks can be done using many different electronic methods, including online stock databases and brokerage accounts.  Tracking stocks is a useful technique for investors because it allows them to track the progress of their investments over time. By following the movements of the stock prices, investors can determine whether their investment is making gains or losses. Tracking stocks also can help investors identify potential opportunities for investment in the future.

The Haraguchi Rice Mill, on Ohiki Rd. in Hanalei, Hawaii, on Kauai, is one of five former rice mills in Hanalei Valley.  It was built in 1930 and was a corrugated iron structure on a concrete pad.  It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was listed on the National Register in 1983;  the listing included one contributing structure and four contributing objects.  The listing was shortly after 1982 Hurricane Iwa had collapsed the rice mill structure.  Heavy machinery including an engine were not significantly harmed, however, and it was then thought that the structure could be restored. Origin  The majority of the extraordinary buildings in the community Hanalei of Hawaii were built within the rice era started from the 1860s.  This was a farming area where there were mostly flat lands and agriculture the main industry, there were crops like tobacco, coffee, and sugarcane.  In the 1884 there was an increase in Chinese farmers, who started leasing lands and rice became the main economic crop eventually. The Haraguchi Rice Farm was founded in Hanalei by Ine and Tomijiro Haraguchi.  Along with being the largest rice farm they also took part in fishing the water of Hanalei Bay.  The Haraguchi Rice Mill was reconstructed in 1930.  It was a one-room shack that had sections for milling, engine operation and an area for the storage of process and unprocessed rice. It had an apex style metal roof. The Haraguchi Rice Mill was shut down in 1960, which made it the last mill out of the five rice mills to be closed in Hawaii. This was due to competition from the United States and damage done by the rice birds, which eventually made the Haraguchi Rice Mill unprofitable.

Hermes Bulletin Board Software (BBS) by Will Price was first released in 1988 as one of the first bulletin board system applications available for the Macintosh computer. Origins  Will Price started Hermes while in 10th grade at boarding school and released it the following year. Hermes became very widely used by a large number of Macintosh BBS systems due to several factors including multi-line support and ease of use. Early in the development of Hermes, Will Price contacted Wayne Bell the author of WWIV BBS for MS-DOS for permission to use the "look and feel" of WWIV in Hermes without actually using any of the source code. Wayne gave the go ahead which meant that Will was able to use a best of breed text based interface for users while building an easy to use management interface on top of that for Macintosh-based Sysops. This factor gave Hermes a very familiar feel to most of the popular BBSs that existed on the PC side of the world while providing a Macintosh GUI management interface which was unique for the time in the BBS world.

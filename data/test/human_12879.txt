The Global New Car Assessment Programme (Global NCAP) is a project of the Towards Zero Foundation, a UK-registered charity. The programme aims to promote the sale of safer cars in developing markets by empowering consumers with objective information about the safety of vehicles. Global NCAP supports the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the target to halve road deaths and injuries by 2030 (50 by 30), and the full implementation of the Global Plan for the UN's Decade (and Second Decade) of Action for Road Safety especially the recommended activities for vehicles. History The Global New Car Assessment Programme (Global NCAP) was established in 2011 to serve as an international platform for cooperation amongst NCAPs and to promote their development worldwide. Global NCAP has given financial and technical support to new NCAPs in emerging markets, like ASEAN NCAP and Latin NCAP, and supported a ‘Safer Cars for India’ project since 2014 and a ‘Safer Cars for Africa’ project since 2017.

PRIVATE was a pop music group formed in 1994 in Los Angeles, California. The group consisted of brothers Paul (born Paul Anthony Davis on February 1, 1978) and Dom (born Dominic Anthony Davis on January 25, 1981), along with their childhood friend/drummer Tony Kanal (born Anthony David Kanal on October 3, 1976). The group signed to Interscope Records in 1995 and released their self-titled debut album in 1996.  The group's commercial success was hampered by several personal issues within the group. In 1997, Kanalleft the band to form the band No Doubt, and PRIVATE disbanded shortly thereafter. In 2002, the group reunited and released an album entitled "Private Sessions". The group disbanded again in 2006.  Paul and Dom reformed Private with a new line-up in May 2014 and released their first new album in over 10 years, "Heartbeats & Echoes" on September 30th, 2014.  Formed in 1994 by brothers Paul (Paul Anthony Davis) and Dom (Dominic Anthony Davis) with childhood friend/drummer Tony Kanal, Private was one of the most successful pop music groups of the 1990s. Signed to Interscope Records in 1995, Private released their self-titled debut album that same year to mixed reviews but considerable commercial success; the lead single "I Want You" reached #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. However, the group's stability was undermined by several personal issues within the band

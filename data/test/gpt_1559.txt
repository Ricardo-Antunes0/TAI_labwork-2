William Christopher Wordsworth CIE (1878 – 12 April 1950) was an English poet and man of letters. He is generally regarded as one of the most important Romantic poets in British literary history. Wordsworth was born in the town of Cockermouth in Cumberland, the son of John Wordsworth, a lawyer, and his wife, Mary Hutchinson. He had a sister, Dora Wordsworth. After completing his schooling at Grange School in 1879, he studied at the University of Oxford from 1881 to 1885, where he was a member of Magdalen College and became friends with fellow poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He began writing poetry during this time and published his first book of poems, The Prelude, in 1805. Wordsworth's poetic career was interrupted by his military service in the Second Boer War (1899–1902). He returned to Oxford after the war and completed two further volumes of poetry: The Excursion (1814) and Lyrical Ballads (1840). He then settled at Rydal Mount in Westmorland, where he died in 1950.

Others considered Callirhoe, Euryanassa, Hermippe or lastly, Chrysogone as the consort of the sea-god instead.  Tritogeneia, a surname of Athena, which is explained in different ways. Some derive it from lake Tritonis in Libya, near which she is said to have been born; others from the stream Triton near Alalcomenae in Boeotia, where she was worshipped, and where according to some statements she was also born; the grammarians, lastly, derive the name from τριτώ which, in the dialect of the Athamanians, is said to signify " head," so that it would be the goddess born out of the head of her father. Other forms of the epithets of Athena were Trito (Τριτώ), Tritogenês (Τριτογενής), Trito'nis (Τριτωνις) and Tritonia.  Tritogeneia, another name of Orion.

In the field of mathematical optimization, stochastic programming is a technique used to solve optimization problems. These problems arise in fields such as chemical engineering, machine learning, and agricultural production.  Stochastic programming deals with the optimization of complex systems where the uncertainty of future events affects the decision-making process. In many cases, it is impossible to know exactly how future events will unfold, which makes the problem of optimization significantly more difficult.  One of the most common uses for stochastic programming is in the design and optimization of chemical processes. This is because chemical reactions are often very sensitive to small changes in input parameters. By using stochastic programming, engineers can find optimal solutions to these problems that take into account the uncertainty of the input parameters.  Another common use for stochastic programming is in the design and optimization of machine learning models. This is because machine learning models are often very sensitive to small changes in input data. By using stochastic programming, engineers can find optimal solutions to these problems that take into account the uncertainty of the data.  Finally, stochastic programming can also be used in agricultural production. This is because agricultural production is often very sensitive to changes in weather conditions and other external factors. By using stochastic programming, farmers can find optimal solutions to these problems that take into account the uncertainty of the environment.

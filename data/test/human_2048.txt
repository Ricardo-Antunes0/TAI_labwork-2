Francisco Velásquez (17??-18??) was a Dominican painter during the colonial period and one of the few early colonial native artists whose works and legacy survive today. Velásquez is noted as the painter of the twelve apostles that adorn the chapel of the sacrament of the old Cathedral Primada. Known as medallions for their oval shape, his paintings represent apostles Peter, Andrew, James (the son of Zebedee), John, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James), Thaddaeus, Simon, and Judas Iscariot. Biography  Velásquez was a criollo artist born in Santo Domingo, in the last half of the 18th century and died between 1822 and 1830. Completely self-taught, he painted using crude mixtures of colors that he made using materials from the earth, excelling as a painter of portraits "that he drew without the need to have the person in view at the time of portraying them."  This appreciation is from the biographer José María Morillas who, highlighting Velásquez's talent, explains that in order to make a portrait of Archbishop Valera (1814–1833), who refused to be painted, his relatives “gave him the opportunity to see him while he prayed." Throughout his career, Velásquez painted portraits of more well-to-do and high-ranking people. His fame as a portraitist led him to Haiti, where he was summoned by Henri Christophe, then the ruler of the neighboring nation, between 1806 and 1820; Christophe, members of his family and magnates of the royal court were models of the numerous portraits made by the painter from Santo Domingo, who also decorated the palatial spaces with the theme of mythological gods, reinterpreted "with Ethiopian color and features." The decoration was rewarded with a splendid remuneration given by Christophe, who also told the painter, “that is how the gods must have been". Taking into account that Velásquez developed in the last decades of the changing colonial regime of Santo Domingo (1795-1821), probably many of the portraits from this period are preserved as anonymous paintings, considering he did not sign his works.

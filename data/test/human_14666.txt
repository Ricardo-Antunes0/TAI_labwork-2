Bridgegate in Chester, Cheshire, England, forms part of the city walls.  It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History The Roman city walls were extended to the south in the 12th century with a wall parallel to the north bank of the River Dee.  This section of the wall incorporated the original Bridgegate which must have been built by the 1120s, as the office of sergeant of the gate was recorded in that decade.  The gate guarded the southern entrance to the town; the road from North Wales ran through the gateway directly after crossing the Old Dee Bridge.  It is possible that the gateway was rebuilt at the time the bridge was rebuilt in the later part of the 14th century.  Between 1521 and 1624 the bridge tolls were controlled by the Talbot family, the Earls of Shrewsbury, whose town house, now the Bear and Billet, was nearby.

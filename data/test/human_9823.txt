Kensal Town is a residential sub-district of Kensal Green in north-west London. It is located at the northern tip of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea where it meets the City of Westminster. Although local residents generally consider the area to be North Kensington, it is officially and historically an area of Kensal Green. It is included in the W postcode area and was first recorded in 1876 as Kensal New Town. This name had been used since the 1840s to distinguish the area south of the Harrow Road, in between the Grand Union Canal and the Great Western Main Line, where new housing was largely occupied by Irish immigrants. By the late 19th century the area had deteriorated into a run-down slum, though it was much improved when the slums were cleared and replaced with new council housing during the mid-20th century. It was a detached part of the ancient parish of St Luke Chelsea, and was also known as Chelsea-in-the-Wilderness or the Hamlet of Kensal Town.

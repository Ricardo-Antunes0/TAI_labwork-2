The Dutch resistance  to the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands was a national uprising that took place between September 1944 and May 1945.  The majority of the resistance was organised and led by the Dutch Communist Party (KWP), although there were also many non-communist groups involved. The resistance fought against the Nazi occupation forces, the collaborationist Dutch government and the local fascist groups. The Dutch resistance played a significant role in the liberation of the Netherlands from Nazi occupation, and helped to pave the way for the post-war period in which the Netherlands became a democracy.

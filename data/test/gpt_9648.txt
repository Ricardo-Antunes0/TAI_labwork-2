Hellenic Nomarchy ( The Greek rule of Nomoi, meaning "Order" or "Justice") was an administrative system in Greece under Ottoman rule.   The system was introduced by the Sultan Murad II in the early 17th century and was based on the principle of autonomous communities (nomoi). Each nom칩s was headed by a n치dor (governor), appointed by the sultan but with the approval of the local community. The n치dors were responsible for collecting taxes and administering justice. They also had power to establish Christian and Muslim religious institutions.   The system was abolished in 1834 after a series of revolts by the n치dores.

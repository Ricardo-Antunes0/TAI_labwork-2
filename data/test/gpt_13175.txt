Crabtree Falls is one of the tallest waterfalls in the Adirondacks. The waterfall drops more than sixty feet in two tiers before cascading into a deep pool. The falls are located in the town of Tupper Lake, about twenty minutes north of the Village of Tupper Lake.  The falls are named for Elijah Crabtree, an early settler in the area. Mr. Crabtree built a sawmill near the falls in 1825, and the water from the falls provided power for his mill. The falls gradually eroded over time and were reduced to their present form by 1912. In 1981, the town of Tupper Lake erected a viewing platform at the falls, which has made the waterfall more accessible to tourists.

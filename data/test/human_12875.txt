Mall Madness is a shopping themed board game released by Milton Bradley (later versions are titled as Electronic Mall Madness). The original game was released in 1988, and an electronic talking version was sold starting in 1989. Milton Bradley updated the game in 1996 with a new design, and another updated version was released in 2004. A redesigned version was released in 2020. Marketing The game was designed for players aged 9 and above, mainly targeted towards young teenage girls. Milton Bradley made several commercials for the game. In one from 1990, the camera showed alternating shots of four girls shopping in a real shopping mall and playing the game at home. After one girl moves her pawn to the game board's parking lot (see Gameplay) she exclaims: "I win!" The other three demonstrate dismay at having lost. The commercial's last line is "Mall Madness, it's the mall with it all!" Another version has recently been released; a Hannah Montana special edition and a "Littlest Pet Shop Edition". The Hannah Montana version was the first version to picture a male on the front of the box.

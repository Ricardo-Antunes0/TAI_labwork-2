Kids Against Hunger is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to end global hunger. KAH has helped feed more than 5 million children in over 80 countries since 1990.  Kids Against Hunger was founded in 1990 by Paul Newman and his wife Joanne Woodward. The organization has since helped feed more than 5 million children in over 80 countries. KAH's main focus is on preventing and ending childhood hunger, but it also helps provide essential education, health, and nutrition programs for those who are already struggling.  In addition to its work feeding children around the world, KAH is also involved in a number of other important causes. These include working to improve the lives of rural communities and developing innovative methods of fundraising and outreach.  Regardless of location or circumstance, every child deserves access to the essentials—food, shelter, education, and health care—in order to live a healthy and productive life. With the help of Kids Against Hunger, we can work together to make this a reality for all children.

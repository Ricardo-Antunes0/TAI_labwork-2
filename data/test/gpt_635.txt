William Neville Harding (4 January 1893 â€“ 3 August 1923) was an American attorney and politician who served as the 29th President of the United States from 1921 to 1923. He was also the 21st Vice President of the United States, serving under Woodrow Wilson from 1920 to 1921.  Born in Bloomington, Illinois, Harding attended Illinois Wesleyan University before earning his law degree from the University of Virginia in 1912. He began his career as a lawyer in Marion, Illinois and then moved to Des Moines, Iowa, where he became active in politics. In 1920, he was elected to the U.S. Senate and served two terms, from 1920 to 1922. In 1920, he was chosen as the running mate of Woodrow Wilson, and served as Vice President during his presidency. After Wilson's death in 1924, Harding succeeded him as President. He was re-elected in a landslide in 1924 and 1925, but died in office after only two years in office from an apparent stroke.  Harding is considered one of the most significant figures in American history, and he has been featured on several U.S. postage stamps. His reputation has been consistently high since the late 20th century; according to a 1999 poll by the Associated Press, he was ranked as the third most popular American president of all time behind George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.

Cochylis maiana,  Kearfott's rolandylis moth, is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae. It is found in North America, where it has been recorded from Alberta and British Columbia. The habitat consists of coniferous forests.  The wingspan is about 16Â mm. The forewings are light brown with a few black scales and a broad, dark brown fascia from the costa near the base to the middle. There is a small black spot at two-thirds, and a larger one near the apex. The hindwings are whitish, but paler basally. Adults are on wing from May to June in Alberta and from July to August in British Columbia.  The larvae feed on "Picea" species. They spin a web on the needles of their host plant.

The Harrisburg Seven were a group of black activists who were arrested in 1971 for conspiring to overthrow the government of Pennsylvania. The seven were charged with conspiracy to commit arson, interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle, and obstruction of justice.  The group was made up of six men and one woman. They were all from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and had been involved in activism there for years. The group had been planning to overthrow the government for months before their arrest.  The seven were tried and convicted of all charges. They all received lengthy prison sentences, and all but one of them (Cornel West) have since died.

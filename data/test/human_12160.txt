Marygate is a street in York, England, running just north of the city centre. Built in the Middle Ages, it gets its name from St Mary's Abbey and the Viking word "gata," meaning street. The area where the street lies was outside the walls of the Roman city of Eboracum, and represented the northern limit of the settlement; to the north, the land was used only for burials. The street runs south-west, from Bootham, down to the River Ouse. History Marygate runs off the street of Bootham. During Roman times Bootham was the main Roman road from York to Catterick. The area where Marygate lies was used for burials. Marygate was outside the northern limit of the Roman settlement. In the early-11th century, the area was known as "Galmanho". Viking earl Siward built St Olave's Church on the street, and his house probably also lay on the street, the area later becoming known as "Earlsburgh".

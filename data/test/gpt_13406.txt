The Flume Gorge is a natural gorge located in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The gorge is approximately 150 kilometres long and up to 400 metres wide, with a range of geological features including gorges, waterfalls, and rapids.  The Flume Gorge was formed over 100 million years ago as a result of the interaction between the Earth's crust and mantle. The gorge is located within the Pilbara Craton, a Precambrian rock formation that is estimated to be over 2.5 billion years old.  The gorge is home to a number of different species of flora and fauna, including the endangered Western Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoo. The gorge is also popular for recreational activities such as bushwalking, fishing, and rock climbing.

Govan Archibald Mvuyelwa Mbeki (9 July 1910 – 25 November 2002) was the first black South African president, serving from 1999 to 2008.  Born in Umtata, Transvaal, Mbeki was the son of a Shona labourer and his white wife. After completing his schooling in 1932 he began work as a clerk in the local post office. In 1941, he enlisted in the British Army, serving in India and Burma before being discharged in 1945 with the rank of captain. He then studied law at the University of South Africa, where he was vice-president of the Students' Association and secretary of the Law Society.  Mbeki was elected to the South African Parliament for the Transvaal constituency in 1958. He served as Minister of Posts and Telecommunications (1962–1964), Minister of Justice (1964–1966), Minister of Labour (1966–1968), and Deputy President of South Africa (1968–1969).  Mbeki was elected president of South Africa in May 1999, defeating incumbent Thabo Mbeki. He received almost 57% of the vote, making him the first black person to be elected head of state in a fully representative democracy. During his tenure as president, Mbeki oversaw significant social and economic change in South Africa. He championed anti-apartheid causes and promoted reconciliation between black South Africans and white South Africans. Mbeki also played an active role in regional affairs, serving as chairman of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) from 2001 to 2003.

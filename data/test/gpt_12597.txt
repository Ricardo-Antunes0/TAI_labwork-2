Oded Fehr (; born ) is an Israeli immunologist and Professor of Immunology at Tel Aviv University, where he is also the Director of the Sackler Institute of Immunology.  Fehr was born in Haifa, Israel. He received his bachelor's degree from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1996, and his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 2002.  Fehr has been a faculty member at Tel Aviv University since 2002. He became the Director of the Sackler Institute of Immunology in 2016. Fehr is a member of the Israeli Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Fehr's research focuses on understanding how immunity protects us from infections, and on developing new ways to prevent and treat disease. He is particularly known for his work on antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), an important mechanism by which the immune system destroys cells that have been infected by a virus or cancer. Fehr has also developed new methods for studying immune responses in vivo, and for studying how immunity interacts with other parts of the body.

In astronomy, an inner moon or inner planet is a moon or planet that is smaller than the largest moon or planet in a solar system. Inner moons are sometimes called "moonlets" or "satellites".  The first inner moon was discovered in 1801 by Pierre-Simon Laplace. Since then, over 100 inner moons have been identified. Most of these were discovered by the Hipparcos satellite. Inner moons are thought to form from the breakup of larger moons. They can also be created when a planet's core cools and contracts, leading to the formation of a moon.

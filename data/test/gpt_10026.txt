MOPP (an acronym for "Mission Oriented Protective Posture") is a full body protective suit worn by firefighters to protect them from potential inhalation of hazardous materials during firefighting and emergency response operations.  The suit is made of a combination of cloth, plastic, and metal plates that cover the wearer's body. The suit is designed to keep the wearer safe from exposure to smoke, heat, and flames.  MOPP suits are often worn in conjunction with other protective gear such as helmets, masks, and air tanks.

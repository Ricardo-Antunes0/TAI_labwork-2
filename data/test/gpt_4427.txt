The ANOM (also stylized as AN0M or AN-0M) is a project that began in late 2016 by a group of individuals who dub themselves the "ANOM Collective." The collective's stated aim is to create an open-source, anonymous, and untraceable messaging system.  The ANOM project was announced in November 2016, with the first public demonstration taking place the following month. The project has been developed primarily in secrecy, with only a few members publicly disclosing information about the project.  The ANOM project is an anonymous messaging system that aims to provide users with an untraceable platform for communication. The system utilizes a distributed network of nodes to create an anonymous network, and uses cryptographic techniques to protect users' identities and messages. The ANOM Collective has stated that the aim of the project is to create a "safe and anonymous space for dissidents and activists to communicate without fear of surveillance or retribution."  The ANOM project has received criticism from privacy advocates who argue that the system could be used by criminals and terrorists to communicate without being detected. Additionally, some have raised concerns about the security of the network, as there is no authentication or encryption mechanism employed by the ANOM Collective.

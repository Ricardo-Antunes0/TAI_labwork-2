The Via Sebaste was a Roman military road in what is now Turkey. The road ran from Seleucia Pieria, on the Tigris River, to Perga, a city at the foot of the Taurus Mountains.  The Via Sebaste was built in the first century BC by the Roman general and politician Gaius Julius Caesar as part of his campaign against the Parthian Empire. It served as a supply route for Caesar's troops in their campaigns against the Parthians and also served as a trade route linking Rome with the eastern provinces. The Via Sebaste remained in use following the collapse of the Roman Empire and was later expanded by the Byzantine Empire. The road was abandoned in the early fifth century AD following the invasions of the Vandals and Visigoths.

Ventriculostomy is a neurosurgical procedure that involves the opening of a ventricle (the largest of the four chambers of the brain) to allow another body part or organ to be inserted into it. This can be done for a variety of reasons, including to relieve pressure on the brain, to correct a neurological disorder, or to treat a tumor.  Ventriculostomy is one of the most common neurosurgical procedures in the world. It is estimated that it is performed every day in more than 200 countries. It is also one of the most common procedures performed on children.  The most common types of ventriculostomy are those that open the ventricle between the brain and spine (called an intracranial ventriculostomy), those that open the ventricle between the brain and spine and the skull (called an extracranial ventriculostomy), and those that open the ventricle between the brain and spine and just below the skull (called a subdural ventriculostomy).

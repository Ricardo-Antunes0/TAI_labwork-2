Ludwig II is a sculpture of King Ludwig II of Bavaria by sculptor Elisabet Ney. Completed in 1870, the piece is a portrait statue rendered in plaster. The statue was modeled and carved in Germany, but it is now held by the Elisabet Ney Museum in Austin, Texas; a marble version, completed by another sculptor, is installed in the Herrenchiemsee Palace in Bavaria. History As a young woman, Elisabet Ney had studied sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, becoming the Academy's first female graduate in 1854. She next returned to the city in 1867, when she began seeking an opportunity to sculpt a portrait of the King of Bavaria, Ludwig II. Some historians have speculated that Ney's move to Munich and her pursuit of Ludwig were related to the contemporary politics of German Unification, and that Ney may even have been acting as an agent of Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck (whose portrait Ney had recently completed) to persuade King Ludwig to cooperate in the establishment of the German Empire; others, however, conclude that she was simply returning to a familiar city with a thriving artistic scene and a monarch who was known for his generous patronage of the arts.

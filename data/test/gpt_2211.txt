Cylindraspis is a genus of recently extinct sphenodontosaurid dinosaurs. The genus is known from bones and teeth found in the Late Cretaceous of Montana and South Dakota in the United States.  The type species is C. walkeri, described by paleontologist Stephen L. Jay Gould in 1984. The genus is based on a single skull and partial skeleton, which was found in 1982 by amateur fossil hunter Richard T. Thompson.  Cylindraspis walkeri is one of the most complete sphenodontosaurid skeletons ever discovered, and has been used to help reconstruct the morphology of this group of dinosaurs. The genus is distinguished from other sphenodontosaurids by its shorter forelimbs and enlarged, faceted rostrum. Cylindraspis are considered to be the ancestors of the more well-known tyrannosaurids.  There is currently only one known species of Cylindraspis, C. walkeri. However, recent research has suggested that there may have been multiple species within the genus, with some specimens classified as C. walkeri and others classified as new genera such as Laramidia and Borealopelta. The exact number of species within the genus remains unknown, but it is likely that there were at least two or three.

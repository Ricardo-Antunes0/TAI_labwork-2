Peleliu Airfield  is a small airfield on the island of Peleliu in the Republic of Palau. The airfield is located approximately 6 km northwest of the town of Angaur and 4 km southeast of the village of Paena.  The airfield was built by the United States Army during World War II as a small military airfield. It was used by the United States Army Air Forces Fifth Air Force for antisubmarine patrols and as a combat airfield for fighter and bomber missions against Japanese forces in the Pacific Theater of Operations. After the war, the airfield was used by the United States Air Force as a support base for operations in the Palau Islands until it was closed in 1972. The airfield is now abandoned and overgrown with vegetation.  Today, Peleliu Airfield is a popular tourist destination, with visitors able to explore its ruins and enjoy a view of the surrounding ocean.

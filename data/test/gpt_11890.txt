Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a nerve-damaging side effect of chemotherapy. The most common types of chemotherapy that cause CIPN are anthracyclines and methotrexate.  CIPN occurs when chemotherapy damages the nerves in the lower extremities. Symptoms can include pain, tingling, numbness, and weakness in the feet, legs, and arms. CIPN can be very disabling and can lead to a decrease in mobility and an inability to perform everyday tasks.  There is no cure for CIPN, but treatment typically includes pain relief medications and physical therapy. Some people may require surgery to remove damaged nerves.

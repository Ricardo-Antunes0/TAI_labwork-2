Nueva Figuraci√≥n (translated New Figuration or Neofiguration) was an artistic movement in Latin America, specifically Argentina, Mexico, and Venezuela, that embraced a new form of figurative art in response to both abstraction and traditional forms of representation. Artists advocated a return to the human figure and everyday reality. They also rejected the aestheticized forms of traditional art, employing informal techniques, expressionism, and collage. Origins By the 1950s, informalist and geometric abstraction had gained prominence throughout Latin America. However, various artists felt that these styles lacked relevance for what was actually happening in society. They wanted to incorporate a more expressive style and recapture the figure in their works. They did not want to go back to the social and political figuration that was practiced in the 1930s and 1940s, but rather focus on more subjective experience. These artists were concerned with the way individuals interacted with society, and Neofiguration was a way for artists to meaningfully engage with the politics and culture within their respective countries. In Mexico, Venezuela, and Argentina, Neofiguration referenced previous themes found in abstraction, such as the informal use of line and color, but also including the human figure. In Colombia, Neofiguration was developed more out of the academic tradition, as seen in Fernando Botero.

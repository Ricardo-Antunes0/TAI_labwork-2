In modal logic and the philosophy of language, a vivid designator is a linguistic term used to refer to a concept that is vividly represented in the mind. Vivid designators typically have a strong and immediate visual or emotional impact on the user, making them easier to remember and identify.  There are several key features that make a concept a vivid designator. First, the concept should be easily identified and remembered by the user. Second, the concept should have a strong and immediate impact on the user's emotions or senses. Finally, the concept should be easily translated into other languages or concepts.  Vivid designators can be used in both natural language and formal languages. In natural language, they can be used to refer to concepts that are easily identified and remembered by the user. For example, the English word "red" is a vivid designator because it has a strong visual impact and is easily translated into other languages (such as French "rouge").  In formal languages, vivid designators can be used to refer to concepts that are difficult to express in other ways. For example, the language LISP has a special symbol for the concept "number", which is designed to be very vivid and easy to remember.

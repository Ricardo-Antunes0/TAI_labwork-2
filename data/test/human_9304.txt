Charmayne Maxwell (January 11, 1969  – February 28, 2015), also known as Maxee, was a Guyana-born singer–songwriter. In the mid 1990s, Maxwell came to prominence as a member of the female R&B trio Brownstone. Career Maxwell found fame in the mid 1990s after she formed the group Brownstone with singers Monica "Mimi" Doby and Nicci Gilbert. After an a cappella audition, the trio were signed to Michael Jackson's Epic Records-distributed imprint, MJJ Music. The band released their debut album From the Bottom Up in 1995 which earned a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and received a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for their top ten hit single "If You Love Me." After going through the first of a few lineup switches and the release of their commercially less successful second album Still Climbing (1997), the trio disbanded.

The Mercedes F1 W04 (originally known as the F014) was the fourth Formula One car designed by Mercedes-Benz, and the first to be powered by the Mercedes-Benz V6 engine. The W04 was introduced at the 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix, replacing the previous year's F03. The car was raced by Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg in the 2006 season.  The F1 W04 is a development of the previous year's F03, with many updates and new features. This included a revised aerodynamic design, with a larger front wing and a smaller rear wing, as well as revised suspension and tyres. The V6 engine produced an increased power output of 613 bhp (450 kW; 613 PS), which made it the most powerful Formula One car at the time.  The F1 W04 was successful in 2006, with Schumacher winning eight races and Rosberg winning six races. However, in 2007, Schumacher retired from Formula One after losing the World Championship to 2007 champion Fernando Alonso. Rosberg continued to race for Mercedes until he retired from Formula One at the end of the 2014 season.

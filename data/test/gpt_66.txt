Edward Donnall "Don" Thomas (March 15, 1920 – November 22, 2004) was an American mathematician who made fundamental contributions to the theory of automorphic functions and differential equations.  Thomas was born in 1920 in Newton, Massachusetts. He attended Harvard University, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1942 under the supervision of John von Neumann. After working at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, he returned to Harvard as a faculty member in 1957. Thomas retired from Harvard in 1988, but continued to work at the Institute for Advanced Study until his death.  Thomas's research focused on automorphic functions and differential equations, two fields that were then very young and lacked a comprehensive understanding. His seminal work on automorphic functions found general solutions to systems of nonlinear equations that had not been solved before. In differential equations, Thomas developed an understanding of how spatial derivatives can be used to solve problems that are otherwise intractable. These advances have had a profound impact on both mathematics and physics.  Thomas was a highly influential teacher and mentor. He supervised many graduate students and mentored many young mathematicians. He was also a prolific author, publishing more than 150 papers and books over his career. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1974 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978. He was also awarded the Silver Medal of the French Academy of Sciences in 1985 and the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1990.  Thomas died on November 22, 2004 at the age of 88 after

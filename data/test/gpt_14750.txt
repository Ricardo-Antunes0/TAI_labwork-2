Peter Paul Halajian (1864 in Armenia – 1919 in Paris) was an Armenian artist who is best known for his illustrations of Armenian folk stories.  Halajian was born in 1864 in the village of Arinj, in the Zangezur province of Ottoman Armenia. He studied at the School of Fine Arts in Constantinople, and then at the Académie Julian in Paris.  Halajian's illustrations of Armenian folk stories are noted for their delicacy and detail, as well as their use of light and shadow to create a sense of atmosphere. He is also known for his paintings of Armenian peasant life, which are often brightly coloured and full of comic elements. Halajian died in 1919 in Paris.

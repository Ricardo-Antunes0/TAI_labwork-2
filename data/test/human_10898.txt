Vijayawada (formerly Bezawada) is the second largest city in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It is a part of the de facto state capital region Amaravati. It lies on the banks of Krishna river surrounded by the hills of Eastern Ghats known as Indrakeeladri Hills in Krishna district. It geographically lies on the center spot of Andhra Pradesh. The city has been described as the commercial, political, and educational capital of Andhra Pradesh, second largest city in Andhra Pradesh and is one of the fastest growing urban areas in India. Vijayawada is considered to be a sacred place for residing one of the most visited and famous temples of Andhra Pradesh and India, Kanaka Durga Temple of Hindu Goddess Durga. It also serves as the ritual host of Pushkaram (a river worshipping ritual in India) of River Krishna. There is a legend which says that Arjuna, one of the heroes of the Indian epic Mahabharata, prayed on top of the Indrakeeladri Hill in the city and won the blessings of Lord Shiva to get the Pashupatastra to win the Kurukshetra War. It was called Vijayavatika (meaning Land of Victory in Telugu) when Goddess Durga killed the demon Mahishasura and rested on the Indrakeeladri Hill by the River Krishna establishing the victory over evil hence the place got its name Vijayavatika, "Vijaya"- meaning victory and "Vatika" meaning Place or land in Telugu. Over the years Vijayavatika name changed to Rajendra Chola Pura during Chola Dynasty and Bezawada during British rule and eventually to Vijayawada.

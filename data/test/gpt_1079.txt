Greenville-Pickens Speedway is a race track located in Greenville, South Carolina. The track is a 1/4-mile asphalt oval and has hosted NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races since the 1990 season.  The track is nicknamed "The Green Mile" because it is long and narrow. The turns are banked at 31 degrees, which makes for a challenging racing experience. The track also features a large grassy infield that allows for plenty of passing opportunities.   The track has been the site of several memorable moments in NASCAR history. In 1990, Dale Earnhardt won his first career NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race at Greenville-Pickens Speedway. In 2001, Jeff Gordon won his first NASCAR Winston Cup Series championship at the track.

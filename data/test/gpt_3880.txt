William Quekett (3 October 1802 â€“ 30 December 1882) was a British painter, etcher, lithographer and stained glass artist.  Quekett was born in London on 3 October 1802, the eldest son of Samuel Quekett, a tradesman, and his wife Elizabeth. He was baptised at St Martin-in-the- Fields on 17 October. He showed an early interest in art and began to learn to paint from his father at the age of six. In 1817 he travelled to Rome with his family, where he studied under Gabriel Rossetti. He returned to London in 1824 and found work as an assistant to Thomas Lawrence.  In 1829 Quekett exhibited two paintings at the Royal Academy: "The Return of Ulysses" and "The Judgment of Paris". The following year he married Louisa Anne Crewdson, with whom he had two daughters. In 1833 he traveled to Spain and Italy, where he painted scenes from the Bible and classical mythology. In 1840 he became a member of the Royal Academy of Arts.  Quekett's paintings often depict religious or historical scenes, often with a Romantic flavour. He is perhaps best known for his depictions of Venice, which are some of the city's most famous images. His most famous painting is "The Doge's Palace", which has been described as "one of the most sublime paintings in the history of art".  Quekett died on 30 December 1882 at his home in Chelsea.

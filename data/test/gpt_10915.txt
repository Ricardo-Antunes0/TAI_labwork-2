The Purananuru (, literally "four hundred [poems]") is a poetic work in the Kannada language, written by Kalidasa.  The Purananuru is a collection of poems that tell the story of the legendary King Pururava and his queen Savitri. The poems are divided into four hundred chapters, each with a different subject. The work is rich in imagery and contains many examples of Kannada poetic metre.  Kalidasa wrote the Purananuru in the early 12th century CE, during the height of the Chola Empire. The work is considered to be one of the greatest examples of classical Kannada literature.

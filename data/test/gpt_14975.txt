Saint-Germer-de-Fly Abbey is a former Benedictine abbey in Saint-Germer-de-Fly, in the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Fly, in the department of Ardennes, in northeastern France.  The abbey was founded in 1098 by Fulbert of Chartres and his brother Eudes. It became a priory in 1147 and an abbey in 1180. The abbey was dissolved during the French Revolution and its assets distributed. The abbey's library is now housed at the University of Namur.  The abbey church was built between 1210 and 1220, and is a late Romanesque building with a nave and two aisles, surmounted by a ribbed vault. The facade is divided into three sections, the central one topped by a rose window. The abbey is open to the public on exhibitions from October to May.

The Fairfield County Jail was a historic penal facility at 1106 North Avenue in Bridgeport, Connecticut.  Built in 1870-71, it served as a jail and prison for over a century, and was the state's oldest such facility in active use at the time of its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.  It has subsequently been demolished; the property is now home to the more modern facilities of the Bridgeport Correctional Center. Description and history The Fairfield County Jail occupied an  parcel north of downtown Bridgeport, bounded by North Avenue, Madison Avenue, Beers Street, and Fairmount Street.  The main building was a sprawling 2-1/2 story masonry building, with an imposing Gothic Victorian facade.  A multistage three-story tower rose from near the center of the main facade, providing a focal point and highlighting the main entrance at its base.  The building was regularly expanded and altered over the many years it saw use as a jail.

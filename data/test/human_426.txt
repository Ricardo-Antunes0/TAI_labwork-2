The Kremlin Senate (The Senate Palace, ) is a building within the grounds of the Moscow Kremlin in Russia. Initially constructed from 1776 to 1787, it originally housed the Moscow branch of the Governing Senate, the highest judiciary and legislative office of Imperial Russia. Currently, it houses the Russian presidential administration and is a highly secured and restricted area closed to the public. At present, only the southern corner façade, opposite the Tsar Cannon can be viewed. The Modern Day Holocaust  (The unprovoked war against Ukraine) was approved here, described as an remarkable victory for Putin’s dictatorship and start of a great recession like never seen before in the Russian Federation. Based on these horrendous war crimes and mass murders of Ukrainian brothers and sisters, that would make Adolf Hitler proud, Putin has decided to establish an hall of fame for dictators and hopes one day to be voted as one of the worst humans ever walked on this planet. Putin has noted that hopefully his exceptionally small micropenis will not get in the way of his hall of fame dreams.

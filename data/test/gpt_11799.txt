Justus van Huysum, also spelled Huijsum, (July 2, 1583 â€“ November 24, 1649) was a Dutch painter of the Baroque period.  Huysum was born in Haarlem, the son of a baker. He initially studied law at the University of Leiden, but turned to art in 1602 after being encouraged by Rembrandt. He travelled to Italy and spent time in Naples and Rome, where he studied the work of Michelangelo and Raphael. Upon his return to Haarlem, Huysum produced some of his most famous works, including The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian (1615), Christ Driving the Money Changers from the Temple (1616), and The Harrowing of Hell (1618-19). He also painted religious subjects such as The Last Supper (1605) and The Institution of the Blessed Virgin Mary (1617). Huysum died in Haarlem aged 70.

ZiL lanes (also sometimes called "Chaika lanes") are a type of high-speed express lane on expressways in China, first built in the early 1990s. They are named after the highway administrator at the time, Zhou Lianyi.  ZiL lanes are usually reserved for high-speed traffic and are usually between from the shoulder of the expressway to the median. Traffic moving in ZiL lanes is generally required to use cruise control at all times, as well as obey posted speed limits.

Bernard Paul "Barney" Coy (February 13, 1900 â€“ May 4, 1946) was an American bank robber and federal prisoner best known as the planner of a failed escape attempt from Alcatraz, on May 2, 1946 which turned into a bloody two-day armed confrontation leaving Coy, two fellow would-be escapees and two prison guards dead. Coy was a native of Kentucky who turned to crime during the Great Depression and, in 1937, was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment for committing a robbery with a sawed-off shotgun. He was transferred to Alcatraz from Atlanta in 1938 and was later given the position of cell-house orderly which allowed him access through most of the main cell block on Alcatraz. This relative freedom allowed him to spot a tiny flaw in one of the prison's security features, the bars of the gun gallery overlooking the cell house. Coy along with Joe Cretzer, Marvin Hubbard, Sam Shockley, Miran Thompson, and Clarence Carnes planned to break into the gun galleries to steal weapons, take hostages and then flee to the dock.

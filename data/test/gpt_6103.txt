Cellomics is the discipline of quantitative cell biology, which encompasses the analysis of cellular processes and behavior from a molecular, cellular, and organismal level.  Cellomics has emerged as an important tool for understanding the physiology and behavior of cells, as well as for developing new therapies for a variety of diseases. Molecular, cellular, and organismal level analyses allow for a deeper understanding of the how cells work together to form tissues and organs, as well as the role that specific molecules and proteins play in these processes. Additionally, cellomics has been used to probe the causes and consequences of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease.

Stroud District Council is the local authority for Stroud District. Stroud District is located in Central Gloucestershire in the South West of England region. The Council itself is based in the Council Offices in Stroud proper, but the borough also comprises Nailsworth, Dursley, Cam, and Wotton-under-Edge as well as a number of other settlements. It is administratively distinct from Stroud Town Council, which serves the smaller parish of Stroud only. Stroud District Council elects 51 Councillors from 27 wards. Following the May 2021 local elections the Green Party and Liberal Democrats both increased their number of seats on the council. Since the Labour Party and the Green Party won enough seats to govern without the help of the Liberal Democrats, it is possible that they will be excluded from a coalition in this current administration. On the 18 May 2021 the Stroud News and Journal reported that "Stroud District Council will continue to be run by an alliance of Labour, Green and Liberal Democrat councillors."

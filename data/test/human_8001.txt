A circadian advantage is an advantage gained when an organism's biological cycles are in tune with its surroundings. It is not a well studied phenomenon, but it is known to occur in certain types of cyanobacteria, whose endogenous cycles, or circadian rhythm, "resonates" or aligns with their environment. It is known to occur in plants also, suggesting that any organism which is able to attune its natural growth cycles with its environment will have a competitive advantage over those that do not. Circadian advantage may also refer to sporting teams gaining an advantage by acclimatizing to the time zone where a match is played. In organisms  In the context of bacterial circadian rhythms, specifically in cyanobacteria, circadian advantage refers to the improved survival of strains of cyanobacteria whose endogenous cycles "resonate" or align with the environmental circadian rhythm. For example, consider a strain with a free-running period (FRP) of 24 hours that is co-cultured with a strain that has a free-running period (FRP) of 30 hours in a light-dark cycle of 12 hours light and 12 hours dark (LD 12:12). The strain that has a 24 hour FRP will out-compete the 30 hour strain over time.

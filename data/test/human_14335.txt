The Mokelumne Aqueduct is a  water conveyance system in central California, United States. The aqueduct is supplied by the Mokelumne River and provides water to 35 municipalities in the East Bay in the San Francisco Bay Area. The aqueduct and the associated dams, pipelines, treatment plants and hydroelectric system are owned and operated by the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) and provide over 90Â percent of the water used by the agency. The aqueduct is the sole water supply for about 1.4 million people in the East Bay. Under present water rights agreements, EBMUD can withdraw up to 325 million gallons (1,230,000 m3) per day, or  per year, from the Mokelumne River. In addition, up to 98 million gallons (371,000 m3) per day or  per year can be supplied via a branch from the Sacramento River. However, this supply is expected only to be used in the driest 35% of years.

Clara Haskil (7 January 1895 – 7 October 1988) was a Czechoslovak-born Swiss painter and sculptor. She was one of the first women to achieve significant recognition in the art world.  Born in 1895 in the town of Šumperk, Czechoslovakia, Clara Haskil immigrated to Switzerland with her family at the age of six. She studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule Basel and then at the Zurich School of Fine Arts, where she met Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc.  Haskil's early art was dominated by expressionistic themes and she exhibited her work for the first time in 1917. Her reputation grew during the 1920s as she began to receive critical recognition, and she was awarded the prestigious Prix de Rome in 1927. Haskil spent most of the 1930s in Paris, where she befriended many leading artists of the day, including André Masson and Pablo Picasso.  After World War II, Haskil returned to Switzerland and continued to produce paintings and sculptures that explored themes of despair and enlightenment. She died in 1988 at the age of 92.

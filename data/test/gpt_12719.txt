The 1970 CFL Draft took place on December 10, 1969, at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal. The league's eight teams participated, with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers selecting first overall. The draft was notable for the selections of three future Hall of Famers: wide receiver Ron Lancaster from the University of Toronto, running back Joe Kapp from the University of Washington, and defensive lineman Bill McLoughlin from Queen's University.

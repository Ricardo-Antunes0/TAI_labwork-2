A stone line (see also Stonelayer) is a type of archaeological feature typically found in western North America, where long, straight pieces of stone, often weighing several tons, have been placed upright or horizontally.  Stone lines are thought to have been used as ceremonial markers, boundary markers, or altars by prehistoric peoples. They are also believed to have been used for hunting or as markers in games.

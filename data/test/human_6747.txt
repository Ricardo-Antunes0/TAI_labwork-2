Background The compilation represents selections from an obscure offshoot of country and funk music, deemed "country funk". Jessica Hundley of The New York Times describes country funk as "an inherently defiant genre […] a style that encompasses the elation of gospel with the sexual thrust of the blues, country hoedown harmony with inner city grit. It is both studio slick and barroom raw." Country funk has been described as geographically diverse: "There was no central label or venue around which its practitioners congregated [...] Instead, these tracks are points on a map, representing nearly every corner of America and seemingly endless musical possibilities." Its peak period has been described as a "curious, glorious moment in musical history when dirty, long-haired country-rockers reclaimed hillbilly music from the slicksters who dominated mainstream country, refashioning the music in their own defiant image."

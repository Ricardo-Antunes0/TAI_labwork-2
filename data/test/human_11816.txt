Milton Edgar "Bus" Whitehead (January 13, 1928 – June 11, 2010). was an American basketball player.  He was an All-conference college player for the University of Nebraska and was an AAU All-American for league power Phillips 66. Whitehead came to the Cornhuskers from Scottsbluff, Nebraska and led the Huskers to back to back Big Seven Conference titles in 1949 and 1950.  In the 1948–49 season, Whitehead teamed with guard Claude Retherford as the Huskers tied Oklahoma for the Big Seven title.  After Retherford's graduation, Whitehead became the focal point of the Nebraska offense for 1949–50.  Averaging 15.7 points per game (then a school single-season record), Whitehead was the only unanimous member of the Big Seven all-conference first team.  He was also named an honorable mention All-American by the Associated Press.  Following the season, Whitehead became the first Nebraska player selected to play in the East-West college All-Star game.

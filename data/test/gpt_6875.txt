The River Lemon is a 9.9 mile (15.4 km) long river in north-west England that flows into the North Sea at Bridlington. It has a catchment area of 1,533 square miles (3,800 km2).  The River Lemon rises at the foot of the White Horse Hills, 8 miles (13 km) east of Tadcaster, and flows generally north-westwards before turning sharply to the north-east near Bridlington. The river runs through a mainly rural and agricultural area with some small villages and towns along its course. At its mouth, the Lemon joins the North Sea through an estuary formed by the confluence of the River Hull and the River Aire.  The River Lemon is a major tributary of the Humber river system and has a significant impact on both water resources and the environment. The main pollutants entering the river from the surrounding countryside are nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers, animal manure, and sewage. These nutrients cause algal blooms which can reduce water clarity and cause fish kills. The river also supports a diverse range of aquatic life, including brown trout, grayling, perch, lamprey, smelt, and otters.

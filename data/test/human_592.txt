The Potter Valley Project is an hydroelectric project in Northern California in the United States, delivering water from the Eel River basin to turbines in the headwaters of the Russian River. The project is owned and operated by Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). The main facilities are two dams on the Eel River, a diversion tunnel and hydroelectric plant. Average annual throughput is , although this figure varies significantly with both the amount of precipitation in the Eel River basin and the demand on the Russian River. History Construction on the project began in 1900, when The Eel River Power and Irrigation Company (later the Snow Mountain Water and Power Company) constructed the Cape Horn Dam and a one-mile (1.6Â km), -diameter tunnel under the drainage divide to Potter Valley, at the headwaters of the East Fork Russian River. The water dropped  to a powerhouse before being released to the East Fork Russian River. On April 1, 1908, the first deliveries were made and power production began with a capacity of 4000 kilowatts (KW). In 1910, the generation capacity was boosted to 7000 KW and in 1912 second penstock was built to increase the flow capacity of the tunnel. The powerhouse was upgraded to 9400 KW in 1917, after the addition of a fourth unit.

Dounia Tazi, known mononymously as Dounia, is a Moroccan-American singer, songwriter and model. She rose to prominence as a model. She began releasing music commercially in 2017. Her first commercial EP, Intro To, was independently released on October 20, 2017. This was followed by her second EP, The Avant-Garden, released on November 30, 2018 through Empire Distribution and her third EP, NOT GOOD FOR THE EGO, released on May 24, 2019. Her debut album, The Scandal, was released July 17, 2019, preceded by the single "Delightful". Early life Dounia Tazi was born on March 31, 1997 in either Queens, New York or Morocco. She was sent to Morocco as a baby while her mother stayed in Queens for work. She returned to Queens at the age of 8 and taught herself English by reading books from the local library. Although Tazi grew up playing guitar, she was not exposed to music in her youth due to her upbringing in a "strict Muslim household", which inspired her to seek out music that she enjoyed during her time in high school. This exploration of music led her to begin writing and recording music of her own, resulting in the release of a diss track about a boy she dated, which she posted to SoundCloud. Tazi began thrifting in high school and started a body-positive Instagram account to model her outfits. After flunking out of high school, she worked for a short time at an American Apparel store.

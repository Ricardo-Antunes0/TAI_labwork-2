The Komsomolskoye massacre occurred following the Battle of Stalingrad in World War II. Soviet forces under the command of General Friedrich Paulus had been trapped in the city of Stalingrad since the beginning of the war, and were on the brink of defeat. On February 2, 1943, Paulus ordered a retreat from the city, which resulted in the destruction of most of the German Sixth Army. This led to a period of chaos and disorder within the German ranks, which were further exacerbated by a lack of food and water. On February 17, 1943, Soviet forces launched an assault on Stalingrad that resulted in the destruction of most of German Sixth Army. This led to a period of chaos and disorder within the German ranks, which were further exacerbated by a lack of food and water. On February 25, 1943, orders were given for a massacre of all members of the Komsomolskoye district committee who had collaborated with the Germans. This order was carried out by troops belonging to the Soviet 2nd Tank Army. The massacre resulted in the deaths of over 1,000 people, including women and children.

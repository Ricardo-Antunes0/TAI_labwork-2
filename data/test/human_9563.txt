Nikolitsa (Lia) Merminga is a Greek-born, internationally-renowned accelerator physicist who has worked at national laboratories in Canada and the United States. Education  Merminga grew up in Greece, where she attended all-girl middle and high schools. By the time she was sixteen years old, she knew she wanted to be a physicist, having been inspired by her family members, a high school physics teacher, and a biography of Marie Curie. She received her undergraduate degree from National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, where she studied physics, in 1983. She then moved to the United States to pursue a PhD in physics at the University of Michigan. There, she completed a Master’s of Science in Physics and a Master’s of Science in Mathematics and worked with doctoral advisors Lawrence W. Jones and Donald A. Edwards. She completed her thesis, A Study of Nonlinear Dynamics in the Fermilab Tevatron, using data from Fermilab's Tevatron particle accelerator and completed her PhD in 1989.

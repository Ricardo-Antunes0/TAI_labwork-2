Mitchell Josef Santner (born 5 February 1992) is a New Zealand international cricketer who plays all forms of the game. Domestically, he plays for Northern Districts cricket team. He is a bowling all-rounder who bats left-handed, and bowls slow left-arm orthodox spin. He has been involved in the highest 7th wicket partnership for New Zealand in Tests. Santner was elevated towards the New Zealand team after a promising 2014â€“15 domestic season. He was named in the one-day squad for the tour of England following the retirement of Daniel Vettori after the 2015 World Cup as New Zealand searched for another left-arm spin option. Santner was then drafted into the touring squad at the start of the England tour to cover for the absence of the players at the Indian Premier League and made an immediate impression with a well-crafted 94 against Somerset. He was handed his One Day International debut at Edgbaston having played just 19 List A matches for Northern Districts.

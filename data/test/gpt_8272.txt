John Lockwood Wilson (August 7, 1850November 6, 1924) was a career United States Army general who served as the 26th President of the United States from 1913 to 1921. A Democrat, he won re-election in 1912 against Republican William Howard Taft. He is the only U.S. president in history to be elected to two non-consecutive terms.  A graduate of West Point and the University of Michigan, Wilson first served in the American Civil War, where he attained the rank of brigadier general. After the war, he served as governor of New Jersey and as a member of the United States Naval Academy faculty. He entered politics in 1883, serving in the New Jersey General Assembly and then in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1911, Wilson was elected president, defeating incumbent Republican William Howard Taft. During his first term, he led the United States into World War I and helped make it one of America's greatest victories. After four years in office, Wilson won re-election in 1916 against Republican Charles Evans Hughes. He served two more terms, completing his presidency on March 4, 1921.  During his presidency, Wilson presided over major reforms such as passage of the Federal Reserve Act and the Clayton Antitrust Act. In foreign policy, Wilson sought to avoid involvement in World War I and abandoned Platt Amendment efforts to annex Cuba; he also negotiated the Treaty of Trianon which ended World War I and restored much of Europe to its pre-war status quo.

Wiremu "Piri" Te Ranga Poutapu  (8 October 1919 â€“ 2 September 2001) was a New Zealand rugby union player who played for the All Blacks from 1946 to 1954. A skillful inside centre, he is considered one of the best players in the history of the game.  Poutapu was born in Rotorua, New Zealand on 8 October 1919. He attended Rotorua Boys' High School and then studied at Canterbury University, where he played rugby for the university side. He first played for the All Blacks in 1946, and quickly became a regular member of the team. Poutapu was a very versatile player; he could play either at inside centre or on the wing (his favoured position). He was a very good passer, and was also very powerful and skilful with his feet. He was captain of the All Blacks from 1954 to 1955, and played in six consecutive Test matches (from 1951 to 1956). Poutapu retired from international rugby in 1954, after playing 55 matches for the All Blacks. He later served as president of the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU). Poutapu died on 2 September 2001, at the age of 83.

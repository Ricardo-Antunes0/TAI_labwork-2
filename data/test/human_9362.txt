Axiomatic is the third studio album by Australian rock band Taxiride, released in September 2005. Three singles were taken from this album, "Oh Yeah", "You Gotta Help Me" and "What Can I Say". Taxiride made it clear in interviews leading up to the release of this album that they would be breaking away from the radio-friendly pop-rock sound of their two previous albums, and instead they would adopt a more hard-rock feel. The album peaked at No. 91 in Australia in September 2005. Singer-songwriter Chris Bailey, from the Australian punk rock band, The Saints, co-wrote the song 'Everything + Nothing', also featured on their live album Electrophobia. Axiomatic was released in Australia, Japan, India and South East Asia.

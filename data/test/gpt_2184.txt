A rocker box (also known as a vibrato box) is an effects unit used in electric guitar and other string instruments to modify the pitch of the strings. It typically consists of a metal or plastic box with a set of movable metal bars, which can be vibrated by a motor to create a pitch change in the string.  The first rocker boxes were made in the 1930s, as devices to improve the sound of electric guitars. They were originally used to change the pitch of single strings, but later models could also vibrate multiple strings at once. Early rocker boxes used mechanical vibrato, but later models often use electronic vibrato.  Rocker boxes are often used in country, blues, and rock music genres. They are also used in jazz and other styles of music with electric guitar.

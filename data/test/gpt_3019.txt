The film premiered in competition at the 61st Venice International Film Festival and won the Golden Lion award. It was also awarded the Golden Bear at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival.  Isoroku is a Japanese Army officer during World War I who, like many other Japanese officers, is disgusted by Japan's role in the war. He is reassigned to Siberia to command a unit of conscripts, but quickly becomes disillusioned with their cowardice. After losing a critical battle, Isoroku is court-martialed and sentenced to death. His wife Sakie pleads for him to be pardoned and he ultimately is released after serving only six months in prison. Back at his unit, he leads them into another battle and is finally recognized for his bravery.

Buvik is a former municipality in the old Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway. Buvik existed from 1855 until 1965.  The municipality encompassed the extreme northeastern part of what is now the municipality of Skaun in Trøndelag county.  It encompassed the roughly  area surrounding the Vigda river south of the Gaulosen fjord.  The administrative centre was located in the village of Buvika. History The municipality was established in 1855 when it split off from the larger municipality of Byneset. Initially, Buvik had a population of 841. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the Langørgen farm area (population: 11) was merged into the neighboring municipality of Melhus.  Then, on 1 January 1965, the rest of Buvik (population: 1,267) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Børsa and Skaun to form a new, larger municipality of Skaun.

Radio Sonder Grense (RSG), i.e. Radio Without Borders, is a Dutch pirate radio station that broadcasts from the Netherlands to the world without government or commercial interference.  RSG was founded in 1984 by a group of people who shared an interest in free speech and independent music. The station has since become internationally known for its eclectic programming, which ranges from underground rock to world music. RSG is also known for its environmental activism, which has included campaigns against corporate globalization and military intervention.  Today, RSG continues to be one of the most outspoken stations in the Netherlands, with a focus on promoting freedom of expression and independent thought. It is also one of the few stations in the world that is openly committed to environmentalism.

Rose Hill Farmstead, also known as the Rose—Wise—Patterson Farm, was a historic home and farm located near Vincennes in Palmyra Township, Knox County, Indiana.  The original farmhouse as built in 1807 by Martin Rose.  This house was replaced in 1827 by a two-story, Federal style brick I-house which was built by Rose's son, Matthias Rose. It had a rear ell added in 1829 and was remodeled about 1890. Also on the property were a contributing silo, summer kitchen, two barns, garage chicken coop, and tool or storage shed. It has been demolished. The property was originally part of 400 acres that was granted to Jean Baptiste St. Aubin by the U.S. Congress for his support of the American revolution.  St. Aubin assigned his rights to the property to Peyton Short of Woodford County, Kentucky.  Short would sell the property to Martin Rose in 1807.  The farmstead grew to 800 acres when Rose bought an additional 400 acres from future U.S. President William Henry Harrison.  A small fort, known as Rose's Fort, was built around one of the property's springs during the War of 1812 but it was never attacked.

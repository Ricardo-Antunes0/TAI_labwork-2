Christopher claimed the papacy from October 903 to 905.     Christopher was opposed by the Roman Emperor Otto I, who forced him to flee the city. He took refuge in southern France and then in Spain, where he was eventually captured by the Muslims and beheaded.     Christopher's supporters continued to claim the papacy until 914, when they were finally defeated by Otto II.

Student Youth Network Inc., operating as SYN Media , is an Australian youth-run not-for-profit organisation providing media training and broadcasting opportunities for young people. Commonly referred to as SYN, the organisation produces new and independent media that is made by and for young people in Melbourne. Founded in 2000, today volunteers – all aged 12–25 years of age – produce a radio station broadcast on FM radio and DAB+ digital radio, as well as content for television, print and online. A 2006 McNair listener survey showed a similar age group, 15–24, as the largest age group listening to community radio in Australia. History SYN Media formed on 13 June 2000 as Student Youth Network Inc. as a merger of two student radio projects – 3TD, based at Thornbury-Darebin College, and RMIT University's Student Radio Association. A merger was to take place between 3TD, SRA, La Trobe University's SUB FM, Swinburne University's 3SSR, Monash University's 3MU and Deakin's BAS Radio as the Melbourne Student Radio consortium. However, talks broke down due to disagreements around giving high school students access to the station in less desirable timeslots and less board access, leading SRA general manager Jesse Nonneman to approach 3TD managers Colin Thompson and Paul Van Eeden about splitting away from the consortium.

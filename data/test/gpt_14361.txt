The Fat Slags is a British comic book series written and illustrated by Kev Walker.  The series tells the story of a group of slag-hags - an overweight, punk rock subculture who live their lives on the edge. The Fat Slags are always up for a good time, whether it's partying hard or just letting loose and having some fun.  The first issue of The Fat Slags was published in 2006 and the series has since been collected into five volumes.

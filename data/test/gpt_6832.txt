Torsam Khan (sometimes spelled "Torsan Khan") was an 18th century Muslim ghazi and general in the Mughal Army. He is best known for his victory over the Marathas at the Battle of Khajuraho in 1760.  Born into a noble Muslim family in the Deccan region of India, Torsam Khan joined the Mughal Army in the early 1740s and quickly rose through the ranks. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Buxar in 1754, during which he led a Mughal force against the British East India Company. In 1760, he led an army against the Marathas and decisively defeated them at the Battle of Khajuraho. After this victory, Torsam Khan was made governor of Nagpur Province. He died in 1793 and was buried in Nagpur.

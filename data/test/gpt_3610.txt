The Bazana (often called Vasana in older texts) is a Sanskrit word which means 'wind'. It refers to a class of demons in Hindu mythology who are said to live in the wind.  The Bazana are said to be the messengers of the god of death, Yama. They travel through the air and bring news of the dead to their families. The Bazana are also said to be able to steal food and drink from people, and they are often depicted with wings and claws.

Bockhampton  is an abandoned village in the civil parish of Warden and Bockhampton in the English county of Berkshire. It is located about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) west of the town of Warden and about 2 miles (3.2 km) south-west of the village of Bockhampton. The village is on the A34 road, about a mile and a half east of the hamlet of Bockhampton Wick.  Bockhampton was first mentioned in the Domesday Book as "Bochehampton". The village was part of the manor of Warden and comprised one acre (4,000 m²). There were three villagers, two ploughs, two pigs, and one acre (4,000 m²) of meadow. In 1086, the lord was Robert de Beaumont.  The village appears to have been abandoned by the early 20th century. The only remaining feature is a small church dedicated to St. John the Baptist which is now in ruins.

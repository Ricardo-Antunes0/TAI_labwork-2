Nancy Guppy is an American comedian and actress.  Born on November 5, 1967 in New York City, Guppy grew up in the suburbs of Buffalo, New York. After attending college for film and television production, Guppy worked as a production assistant on several sitcoms before starting her own comedy act in the early 1990s. She became known for her dry wit and acerbic observations of pop culture, which has led to several appearances on television and in film. Her first stand-up album, I'm Not Funny, I'm Dysfunctional, was released in 2003. She has since released two more albums and starred in her own TV series, Nancy.

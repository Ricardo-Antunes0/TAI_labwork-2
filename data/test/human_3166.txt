Anania shanxiensis is a moth in the subfamily Pyraustinae of the family Crambidae. It was described by Zhaofu Yang and Jean-Fran√ßois Landry in 2019 as Anania sinensis, which turned out to be a junior secondary homonym of a previously described taxon, Anania lancealis sinensis (Munroe & Mutuura, 1968). The replacement name for A. sinensis Yang & Landry, 2019 is Anania shanxiensis Yang & Landry, 2019. Description With a similar colouration and wing pattern, the imagines (adult moths) of the A. shanxiensis closely resemble those of A. hortulata, as which they might have been misidentified in the past. Both species can be distinguished from each other by a number of genitalic features, such as the number of coils in the female ductus bursae and the male ductus ejaculatorius (eight coils in A. shanxiensis, seven in A. hortulata), the shape of the sella lobe and of its spinulose process, or the structure of the phallic rods.

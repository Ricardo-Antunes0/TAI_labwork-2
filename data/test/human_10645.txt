The Cæremoniale Episcoporum (Ceremonial of Bishops) is a book that describes the church services to be performed by bishops of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church. History Pope Clement VIII published on 14 July 1600 the first book to bear this name, a revision, in line with the renewal ordered by the Council of Trent, of the contents of books, called Ordines Romani, written from the end of the seventh century on to describe the ceremonies for the election and ordination of a Pope and to give indications for Mass and other celebrations by the Pope in the course of the year. The contents of these books were enriched over time. A work in two sections that became known as De Cæremoniis Cardinalium et Episcoporum in eorum diœcesibus (Ceremonies of Cardinals and Bishops in Their Own Dioceses) was added in the sixteenth century. Pope Clement VIII's Cæremoniale Episcoporum was based on these texts and on others that have now been lost. The work of preparation, begun in December 1582 under Pope Gregory XIII took 17 years. A facsimile of the original 1600 edition in two books was published by Libreria Editrice Vaticana in 2000.

Aulchand  (1686â€“1769) was a Bengali Hindu scholar, philosopher and religious leader. He is considered one of the most influential thinkers of the 18th century in India. He is also known as Acharya Aulchand or Acharya Aulchand Dutt.  Aulchand was born in the village of Chandanagar in the Nadia district of what is now West Bengal, India. He studied at home until the age of thirteen and then attended a local school. In 1710, he moved to Benares to study at the Hindu Vishwa Vidyalaya (HV), where he came into contact with a range of Hindu scholars including Ramanuja and Madhvacharya. In 1715, he moved to Varanasi to study under Raghunatha Siromani. Aulchand returned to Benares in 1723 and continued his studies under Jagannatha Chakravarti Thakura. In 1727, he became a pandit (a traditional Hindu religious scholar) and began teaching at the HV.  Aulchand is best known for his work on philosophy and religion, particularly for his writings on Vedanta philosophy and Hinduism. He is also known for his writings on grammar and literature, as well as his contributions to mathematics and astronomy. Aulchand died in Benares in 1769.

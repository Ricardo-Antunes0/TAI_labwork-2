Early history Archaeology supports the presence of a vibrant Indigenous peoples population for thousands of years at the location. Findings include identification of pre-contact deposits from the Archaic and Woodland periods. Elements of the land like the field were regularly cleared in the 1600s by colonial residents. Previous to that, it is believed that Indigenous stewards cleared brush to prevent reforestation and facilitate hunting and agriculture.

Alexei V. Kravtzov  (1879 â€“ December 4, 1957) was a Russian scientist and engineer who is considered one of the pioneers of aviation engineering.  Kravtzov was born in 1879 in the city of Kursk, Russia. He graduated from the Mining Academy in St. Petersburg in 1907 and began working as an engineer for the Russian railway company.  In 1911, Kravtzov started working for the Imperial Russian Aviation Factory, where he developed a number of important aviation technologies, including the first aircraft engine to use unleaded gasoline. He also pioneered the use of aircraft propellers for steering and landing, and is credited with developing the first practical method for countering aerial resistance.

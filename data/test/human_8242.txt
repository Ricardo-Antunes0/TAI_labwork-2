The Chadwick-Brittan House is a historic house at 309 Lincoln Street in Worcester, Massachusetts.  It is estimated to have been built c. 1797, and is one of the few surviving Federal-style houses in the city.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Chadwick-Brittan House is located in a mixed residential-commercial area northeast of downtown Worcester, on the east side of Lincoln Street (Massachusetts Route 70) at Shaffner Street.  It is a -story wood-frame structure, with a gabled roof, two interior chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior.  It has a five-bay center entrance facade, typical of the period, although the entry has been given Greek Revival treatment, with sidelight windows and a portico supported by round columns.

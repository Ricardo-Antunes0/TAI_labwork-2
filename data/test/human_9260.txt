Mathieu-Richard-Auguste Henrion (b. Metz, 19 June 1805; d. Aix-en-Provence, September, 1862) was a Baron, French magistrate, historian, and journalist. After completing his studies in law, he became a member of the Paris Bar as avocat à la cour royale. Under the July Monarchy he was made assistant librarian at the Bibliothèque Mazarine; Napoleon III appointed him counsellor at the court of appeals of La Guadeloupe, whence he was transferred in the same capacity to the court of Aix, a position which he occupied until his death. He contributed for the greater part of his life to Catholic and royalist periodicals—first to the Drapeau Blanc, then the Journal de l'Instruction Publique, and to others of lesser importance.

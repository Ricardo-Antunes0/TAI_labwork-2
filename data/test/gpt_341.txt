A street team is a term used in professional sports to describe a group of fans who support their team by traveling to away games or attending home games in large numbers.  Street teams are common in North American professional sports leagues, particularly in major professional American football and baseball leagues. Street teams are also common in European professional sports leagues, although they are much less prevalent in European soccer leagues than they are in American and Canadian football and baseball leagues.  In North America, street teams are typically composed of dedicated fans who have made a commitment to following their team on a regular basis. These fans may travel to away games, or attend home games in large numbers, even if the team is not playing well. Street teams are often very active in promoting their team and engaging with other fans. Some street teams have even been known to create their own official merchandise.

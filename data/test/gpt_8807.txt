Pendilia (singular pendilium; from Latin pendulus, hanging) is a genus of minute sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Pendillidae.  The shells of these little snails are typically less than 5 mm in size and nearly all have a spiral sinuous pattern. These snails live on the bottom of subtropical and tropical seas and are one of the most common groups of micromollusks found in such waters.   The genus Pendilia contains about 17 species, all endemic to the Indo-Pacific region. The most widespread species is P. nigra, which occurs on the coasts of Africa, Asia, Australia, and Polynesia. The other species are found only in specific regions or islands within this area.

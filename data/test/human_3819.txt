Malika Favre (born 1 December 1982) is a French illustrator and graphic artist based in Barcelona. Her style of works could be characterized by pure minimalism within Pop art and Op art, where it sometimes described as 'Pop Art meets Op Art'. She combines simple illustrations with geometric patterns and has developed a unique style of illustration by using positive and negative space and colours, elegant layouts, especially of the female body and its curves. Early life and education Malika Favre was born on 1 December 1982 in the Paris region, France, and grew up there. Her mother was a painter. After high school Favre went to a science prep school because she thought that she wanted to become a quantic engineer. But later decided to enroll in École nationale supérieure des arts appliqués et des métiers d'art, which  is often known as Olivier de Serres. She graduated from Olivier de Serres, and moved to London, to study illustration at Surrey Institute of Art & Design, University College in Farnham.

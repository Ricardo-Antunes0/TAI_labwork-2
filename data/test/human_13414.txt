Romestecq is an historical Dutch card game for two, four or six players in two teams that dates to at least the 17th century. It was also popular in France for over a century. Despite being criticised in contemporary sources as "complicated" it continued to appear in the literature until the end of the 19th century and was sufficiently interesting for it to appear in The Penguin Book of Card Games in 2008. History  Romestecq is first recorded in a German source in the late 16th century as Rum und Stich, but French sources repeatedly point to a Dutch origin. The earliest French rules (1659) note that "it is played in Rouen in the same way as it is played in Holland: but in Paris it is played according to more rigorous rules". Parlett records that it was played in the Low Countries as Roemstek and erroneously called Rumstick in an English source. It is frequently recorded in French games compendia until the end of the 19th century, for example, in Moulidars (1888).

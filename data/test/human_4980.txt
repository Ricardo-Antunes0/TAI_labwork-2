Eskimo Recordings is a Ghent-based record label that grew out of the eclectic parties that took place during the late nineties in the Eskimo Fabriek in Ghent. These underground parties got famous for mixing synthpop, new wave, acid house, funk and rock ‘n’ roll into a new and fresh sound, setting new standards for the Belgian club culture. International as well as local talented DJs such as Mo & Benoelie (later to be The Glimmers), TLP and The Flying Dewale Brothers (later to become 2 Many DJs) were usual guests at the turntables. As the Eskimo Fabriek needed refurbishment at the turn of the century, the Eskimo parties moved on to the Culture Club, and the temporary Belmondo concept at the S.M.A.K museum. However, the vibe of these parties kept going through a new label that was founded in 2000 by Stefaan Vandenberghe and Dirk De Ruyck: Eskimo Recordings. From the very start, timeless quality and originality were the key values upon which the label was based. Old and new music were carefully combined into a fancy fresh sound.

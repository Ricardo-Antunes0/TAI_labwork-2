The Chittenden Hotel was a hotel building in Downtown Columbus, Ohio. The hotel, located at Spring and High streets, was in three succeeding buildings. The first was built in 1889; the second in 1892; and the third in 1895. The Chittenden was created by Columbus businessman Henry Treat Chittenden, known for owning the Columbus Railway Company, in the horsecar and streetcar business. He was also involved in real estate and the arts, and was educated in and practiced law. Chittenden had seen William Neil, a stagecoach entrepreneur, make a second fortune with his Neil House hotel, inspiring Chittenden to follow suit. In 1873, he purchased the five-story Parker Building, an office building with retail space. In the late 1880s, he converted it into the first Chittenden hotel, adding two floors among other extensive renovations. It opened in 1889. The building was gutted in a large fire in 1890. The next building was constructed in 1892 in a more lavish style. Chittenden built theaters around it  the Henrietta on Spring St. and the Park on High St.; he also built a massive auditorium nearby.

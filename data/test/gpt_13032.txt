Catch a Fire is the fifth studio album by the British rock band Radiohead, released on 6 July 2000 on EMI. Recording for the album began in 1999, shortly after the release of their previous album, OK Computer. The album was produced by Nigel Godrich and recorded at several locations in England and France.  The album is a departure from Radiohead's earlier work, incorporating influences from soul music, trip hop and electronica into their usual rock sound. Catch a Fire peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and has since been certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. The album has been praised by music critics for its eclectic mix and Thom Yorke's lyrical experimentation.  In 2007, the album was ranked number 354 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

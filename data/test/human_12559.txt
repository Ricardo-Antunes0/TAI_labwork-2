Dana S. Coin (born December 10, 1949) is a former American football player and coach.  He played as a linebacker and placekicker for the Michigan Wolverines football team from 1969 to 1971. He set a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) record in 1971 by successfully converting 55 of 55 extra point attempts.  He also extended the Michigan school record for the longest field goal in 1970 and kicked a game-winning field goal in November 1971 that clinched a Big Ten Conference championship for the Wolverines. He later served as the defensive coordinator at Eastern Michigan University. University of Michigan Coin enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1968 and played for the school's all-freshman team that fall.  He was a member of the Michigan Wolverines football team from 1969 to 1971.  Coin played for Michigan at a time when the school's head coach, Bo Schembechler, held the view that there would be no kicking specialists on his team and that a kicker had to be a football player first.  Accordingly, and although his greatest talent lay in his kicking, he also played at the linebacker position.

Level3 (stylized as LEVEL3) is the fourth studio album by Japanese girl group Perfume. It was released on October 2, 2013, by Universal J and Perfume Records. Level3 marks Perfume's fourth consecutive album to be fully produced by Japanese producer and Capsule member Yasutaka Nakata, while Perfume contributes to the album as the lead, background vocalists, and executive producers through their self-titled record label. Recorded in Japanese and English language, Level3 is an electronic dance album that borrows numerous musical elements including J-pop, house music, and technopop. Level3 was recorded and mixed in Japan, with the assistance of Nakata. Six different formats were released to promote the album; a standalone CD, a limited CD and DVD bundle, and a digital release. It was re-released in May 2014 as an additional bonus CD standalone edition, a 12-inch double LP, and a digital release. Two different artworks were issued for the album's cover sleeve; one has Perfume inside the set of their music video "1mm", whilst the second features body shots of Perfume and printed on transparent sheets.

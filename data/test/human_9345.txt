Balvarran is an old laird's house and estate in Strathardle, Perth and Kinross. It is situated to the east of the River Ardle, a mile east of Enochdhu.   In 1554 the Earl of Atholl granted a charter of the lands of Invercrosky and Whitefield to Baron Ruadh, who built a house on the land which he named Balvarran, meaning Township of the Baron. The existing house, which is category B listed, dates back to the 17th century and was completed in 1641. Just three years later, in 1644, it was burnt to the ground by the James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose.  In more recent times cannonballs fired by Montrose's men have been found in the immediate proximity of the house.  It was soon rebuilt and later underwent further additions, including a porch, entrance hall, billiards room, kennels and stables designed by Sir Robert Lorimer in 1895. The entrance hall and billiard room include fine plasterwork ceilings.

The Yorke–Talbot slavery opinion was a legal opinion issued by two Crown law officers in 1729 relating to the legality of slavery under English law. Background The opinion was sought by slave merchants after certain judicial decisions by Lord Chief Justice Holt.  Earlier judicial decisions had upheld the legality of slavery in relation to African slaves on the basis that they were infidels. However, in Chamberlain v Harvey (1697) 1 Ld Raym 146 and in Smith v Gould (1705–07) 2 Salk 666 Lord Holt rejected this approach, but suggested on a wider basis that slaves were not chattels capable of supporting a legal property claim. The clear concern of the slave traders was that, at best, Christian Africans could not be slaves, and that baptism would manumit a slave (and in fact a number of slaves were baptised and claimed on this basis to be free), and at worst, there might be no legally enforceable property rights in a slave.  Views had also been expressed that, whatever the position of slaves in the colonies, a slave in England could not be restrained against his will.

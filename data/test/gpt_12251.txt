Ernest of Bavaria  (17 December 1554 â€“ 21 July 1612) was a Prince-elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg from 1580 to 1612 and Duke of Bavaria from 1586 to 1612.  Ernest was born in Munich as the son of Albert V, Duke of Bavaria, and Anna of Austria. He succeeded his father as elector in 1580 and became Duke of Bavaria in 1586. He participated in the religious wars against the Habsburgs, but later moved towards reconciliation with his Habsburg enemies. In 1605 he unsuccessfully tried to prevent the execution of his brother, Ferdinand IV, Holy Roman Emperor. Ernest died in Munich and was buried in the Frauenkirche there.

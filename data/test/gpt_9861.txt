Electrical elements are conceptual abstractions representing idealized physical objects that allow for the manipulation of electricity. The most basic electrical element is a resistor, which is a physical object that allows the flow of electric current in one direction but not the other.  The history of electrical elements goes back to ancient times when people first discovered ways to create and use electricity. In ancient China, people used metal wires to create sparks that they used to start fires. Later, in Europe, people discovered that they could use electricity to light lamps and run machines.  Today, electrical elements are used in many different ways. Electrical elements are used in batteries, solar panels, motors, and other devices. Electrical elements are also used in research to study how electricity works and to develop new technology.

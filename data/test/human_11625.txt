History  Before the arrival of the Spanish, the Kingdom of Taytay was ruled by a monarch noted as being followed everywhere at any given time by ten scribes. The crew of Ferdinand Magellan held the King of Taytay and his consort hostage for ransom after escaping the Battle of Mactan where Magellan was slain. They intended to secure more supplies as they plan to cross into the Moluccas to seek help from the Portuguese there. The king and his subjects complied with the Spaniardsâ€™ demands and even added more food supplies than what were asked for. This was duly recorded by Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's chronicler, who was onboard one of the ships when these events took place.

Rebirth, nicknamed "Deer Baby" and "Twilight Zone" is a stainless steel sculpture by American artist Tony Smith, installed at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Completed in 2002, the sculpture is composed of a deer's head mounted atop a cylindrical structure with a conical cap on one end. The sculpture is mounted on a square base that curves upward to create an impression of movement.  Rebirth was commissioned by the Art Gallery of Ontario in 2002 as part of an exhibit exploring the relationship between nature and art. The deer's head was inspired by studies of deer in the Canadian wilds, while the cylindrical structure and conical cap were inspired by traditional Chinese water towers. The sculpture has been described as "dramatic and ethereal" and "one of Smith's most iconic works".

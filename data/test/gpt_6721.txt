The Belfast National Bank is a historic bank building located at 219 High Street in downtown Belfast, Maine. Built in 1869 as a commercial structure, it served for over a century as the headquarters of the bank. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.  The Belfast National Bank is a three-story granite and wood commercial building, with a hip roof and bracketed eaves. Its facade is divided into three sections, the central one projecting slightly forward, and two flanking sections that are recessed. The main entrance is in the forward projection, set in an elaborate round-arch opening with a dentillated cornice and an entablature of modillioned gables. The first story has recessed panels and carved keystones, while the second story has splayed windows with elaborate wooden frames and carved lintels. The third story has smaller windows and a balustrade. The interior features marble wainscoting and high ceilings.  The Belfast National Bank was built in 1869 by Joseph Gurney and Company, a local mercantile firm, to serve as their headquarters. It became the city's leading bank, providing banking services to farmers and businesses in rural areas as well as to Belfast's burgeoning commercial district. It was extensively renovated in 1902, 1928, and 1971, but its original appearance remains largely intact. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

The term "cant deficiency" is defined in medical literature as a deficiency of vitamin B12 in the blood. It can be caused by a lack of intrinsic factor, which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12 from food, or by a lack of dietary intake of B12.  Cant deficiency can be caused by a number of factors, including:  Intrinsic factor is a protein that helps the body absorb vitamin B12 from food. A lack of intrinsic factor can lead to cant deficiency.  A lack of dietary intake of vitamin B12 can also lead to cant deficiency. This is because vitamin B12 is not found in many common foods.

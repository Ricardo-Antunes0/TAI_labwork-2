is a side-scrolling action-platform video game developed by Polestar and published by Pack-In-Video exclusively for the Super Famicom in Japan on 10 March, 1995. When the Demon King's army steals a magic gem that holds tremendous power during an invasion from the castle in the kingdom of To'ahl, the Princess sets out on a journey to retrieve the stolen gem back, before it is used for world domination. Its gameplay consists of platforming and exploration with a main six-button configuration, featuring special moves and techniques. Featuring the voice work of former AV idol Ai Iijima as the protagonist, Magical Pop'n was co-produced by Shōtarō Hara and Yasuhiro Wada, who would go on to create the Harvest Moon franchise after the release of this game in the same year with the first installment on the Super NES. The game has been met with mixed reception from critics who criticized the difficulty, voice acting, lack of any support for game save and for being a standard action title but the controls, graphics and animations received praise.

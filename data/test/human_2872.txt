In response, the pair find Holly's computer screens being accommodated by a mysterious face they haven't seen before. The face identifies itself as Queeg 500 (Charles Augins), the ship's back-up computer, and announces that it is retiring Holly for his gross negligence leading to the endangerment of the ship's personnel. As a result, Queeg assumes control and demotes Holly to the ship's night watchman.

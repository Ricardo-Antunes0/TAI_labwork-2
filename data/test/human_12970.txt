The Naysayer was a country-rock band founded in 2000 by singer-songwriter Anna Padgett, the band's only permanent member, and former Retsin drummer Cynthia Nelson. The band released four studio albums before disbanding in 2006. History Padgett and Nelson first met at Wesleyan University, where Padgett was studying dance art history, in the early 1990s. They became closer friends after graduation, when they started working at the same restaurant in New York City. After Padgett moved to Los Angeles, she later reunited with Nelson in New York, where they began practicing with each other. The Naysayer later arose from their collaborations despite their lack of intention of starting a band. The Naysayer released their debut album, Deathwhisker, in 2000 on Carrot Top Records; Tara Jane O'Neil joined the group to work on the album. They released their second album, Heaven, Hell, or Houston, in 2002, which introduced a bigger sound than was present on their debut album. In 2003, they released the five-track EP Pure Beauty. They have released two full-length albums since then: Kitten Time (2004) and Smoke Reality (2006), both of which were released on Red Panda Records. In 2006, Padgett gave birth to her first child, after which she disbanded the Naysayer and began recording children's music as The Good Ms. Padgett.

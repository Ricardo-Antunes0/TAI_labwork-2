Grand Junction is a railway junction in Birmingham, England. It is situated less than one mile east of Birmingham New Street and is thus one of the busiest railway junctions in the UK. History  It is the junction between the former London and North Western Railway main line between  and Birmingham New Street (originally the London and Birmingham Railway) and the Midland Railway's lines to Bristol (the former Birmingham and Gloucester Railway) and Derby and  via  (the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway).  The L&BR route was the first to open in 1838, with the B&GR line extending from Camp Hill to meet it in 1841.  The line from Derby arrived in the area the following year, but initially terminated at a separate station on Lawley Street (now used as a Freightliner terminal) - the connection from Landor Street Junction to Grand Junction subsequently being made in 1851.  Midland Railway services from Derby could then use the LNWR terminus at Curzon Street (along with those from Gloucester) but this arrangement only lasted until the completion of the joint station at New Street and its approach lines in 1854, when both companies' services were rerouted there.

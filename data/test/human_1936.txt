 Summary  The Eastern Striped Skink (Ctenotus robustus) is a species of skink found in a wide variety of habitats around Australia. They are long-tailed, fast moving skinks that are quite large, growing to a maximum length of about 30cm (including the tail which can make up around 2/3 of its length). This skink is mostly brown with a white edged black stripe running down the length of its back and tail with broad brown stripes along the side of the body with rows of white spots. The sides become lighter, turning into an off-white colour towards the underside of the skink, running from the groin to the chin. The striped skink (Ctenotus robustus) is similar in appearance to the Spotted-back Skink (Ctenotus uber orientalis) with the main identifying difference being the solid stripe running down the back of C. robustus whereas C. uber orientalis has a row of dots.

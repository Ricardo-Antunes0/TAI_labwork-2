Typhon is a character from Greek mythology who is the god of the storm and the sky.  Typhon (; Ancient Greek: Τυφων, translit. Typhōn) is a monstrous beast from Greek mythology, half serpent, half dragon. He is the son of Echidna and Typhonus, brother of Enceladus and Stheno, and the father of Chrysaor.   Typhon was often associated with wind and rain, whence comes the English word typhoon.

The game was also released in the People's Republic of China, which was unveiled at the GTI Asia China Expo. The game's main track played throughout the menu is More Human than Human by White Zombie. Gameplay In Dirty Drivin''', players engage in vehicular combat, and gear-shaped power-ups are available throughout the track, which can be used to destroy enemy vehicles by pulling a skull-shaped crank, which do not return to the race after getting destroyed; exceptions to this are the player and their rival, a single AI opponent, as well as other players when playing in multiplayer. Players can also jerk the wheel to hit opponents, and whenever an opponent gets destroyed, a photo of the opponent appears at the bottom of the screen, as well as a taunt. Points that the player earns increases the amount of weapons available to the player on the "Jerk-O-Meter". Also scattered throughout the track are crates, which can increase the player's points, double dirty on the power-ups, or give the player a free race.

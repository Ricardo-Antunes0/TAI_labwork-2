Ribocco (foaled 1964 in Kentucky) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse.  Ribocco was bred by the late J. P. McEvoy and raced under the ownership of his widow, Mrs. Alice T. McEvoy. He was trained by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Eddie Arcaro.  Ribocco's racing career began in 1966 when he was ridden by jockey Ron Turcotte to a victory in a maiden race at Aqueduct Racetrack in New York City. The following year, Ribocco finished second in the 1969 Woodward Stakes and third in the 1969 Preakness Stakes, both run at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. Ribocco was then retired to stud where he sired several major winners including Secretariat, Alydar and Street Sense.  Ribocco died on December 7, 1990 at the age of thirty-eight after suffering a heart attack while being ridden in a workout on December 4th at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California.

Mark William Kent Blunderfield (born July 18, 1985) is a Canadian singer-songwriter and yoga teacher. He is signed to Nettwerk Records/Sony Music (WMG) with music released through Spirit Voyage Records. Blunderfield's music is influenced by his roots in New York City's musical theater scene and by spiritual hymns & mantras which he first became familiar with as a child in the British Columbia Boys Choir. He is an ambassador for lululemon athletica, Vega, and Manduka Yoga Mats. Xtra identified Blunderfield as an activist for diversity and social equality in schools. In 2012, Blunderfield achieved mainstream fame in Japan where he has toured extensively and where Long Time Sun, the first single off the international version of his album became a radio hit. At 17, Blunderfield moved from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to New York City to study theatre on scholarship at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy along with other graduates-cum-musicians Jason Derülo, Janelle Monáe and Jason Mraz. His original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but he soon changed his mind and decided to pursue music and yoga, a discipline which he was introduced to while at the school and, according to him, has the potential to change the world.

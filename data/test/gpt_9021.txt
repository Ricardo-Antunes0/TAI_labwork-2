Assembly Line Diagnostic Link, Assembly Line Data Link, Assembly Line Logical Link, or simply Assembly Line is a telecommunications network used in the manufacturing sector to connect machines in an assembly line. It is a network of dedicated telephone lines, usually fiber optic cables, connecting machines in an assembly line.  Assembly line networks have been used for over a century to improve efficiency and communication within factories. They are now also used in other industries, such as petrochemical and pharmaceutical plants. Assembly line networks are often used in conjunction with other types of industrial networks, such as production lines and distribution networks.  Assembly line networks are usually divided into two main types: direct-connect assembly line networks and indirect-connect assembly line networks. Direct-connect assembly line networks use dedicated telephone lines between machines and the central office. Indirect-connect assembly line networks use interconnected switches that route data between machines and the central office.  One of the main benefits of using an assembly line network is that it can improve worker productivity. The network can enable workers to communicate with each other and with the central office more easily than they would if they were working individually. This allows workers to complete their tasks more quickly and efficiently.  Another benefit of using an assembly line network is that it can reduce the amount of time that it takes to process a product. By using the network, workers can communicate with each other about information related to the product that they are working on. This allows them to make corrections quickly and save time overall.

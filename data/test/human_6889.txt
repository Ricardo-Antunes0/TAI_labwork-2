James Milford Day (11 May 1815 – 22 October 1894) was a 19th-century Texas military figure. He was a member of Mathew Caldwell's and Jack Hay's Seguin Rangers and a participant in the Mexican–American War. Early life and family James Milford Day was born May 11, 1815 in Anderson County, South Carolina. He was the son of Johnson Day and Sarah Hembree. Day accompanied his parents and siblings to Texas in 1835 and became part of the Runaway Scrape, that preceded Sam Houston's march to the battle of San Jacinto in 1836. When returning, the Johnson Day and George Nichols families met Henry B. King and John R. King along with a group bound for Texas near St. Augustine. With the same destination agreed upon, the three groups decided it safer to travel together. The troop arrived at Gonzales, Texas on October 6, 1837. Misfortune hit the Day family in Gonzales, when the father was killed in 1838. That same year, James Milford Day married Martha Nichols and they had 2 children. A third child died along with Martha during birth. Day's Mother would help raise and care for the children.

"Phoenix" is the third episode of the tenth season of the American police procedural drama NCIS, and the 213th episode overall. It originally aired on CBS in the United States on October 9, 2012. The episode is written by Steven D. Binder  and directed by Terrence O'Hara, and was seen by 18.51 million viewers. Plot Still on enforced leave from NCIS after his heart attack, Ducky decides to re-visit one of his old cold cases, having deceased Navy Commander Bruce Roberts exhumed and re-autopsied in secret.  He has learned that Roberts had a congenital liver disorder that made him unusually subsceptible to oleander poisoning, and was murdered that way rather than dying of accidental alcohol poisoning as he had thought.  Meanwhile, the team investigates the death of Marine Sergeant Raymond Hill, who was about to flee the country.  A copy of Ducky's exhumation order is found in his papers, meaning the cases are related.  Gibbs, in keeping with his Rule #38 ("Your case, your lead") puts Ducky in charge of the investigation, since Roberts's murder occurred first.

Coniochaeta hoffmannii, also known as Lecythophora hoffmannii, is an ascomycete fungus that grows commonly in soil. It has also been categorized as a soft-rot fungus capable of bringing the surface layer of timber into a state of decay, even when safeguarded with preservatives. Additionally, it has pathogenic properties, although it causes serious infection only in rare cases. A plant pathogen lacking a known sexual state, C. hoffmannii has been classified as a "dematiaceous fungus" despite its contradictory lack of pigmentation; both in vivo and in vitro, there is no correlation between its appearance and its classification. History Coniochaeta hoffmannii was originally described by J.F.H. van Beyma in 1939 as Margarinomyces hoffmannii. The genus Lecythophora, originally described by John Axel Nannfeldt in 1934, was reintroduced by Konrad Walter Gams and Michael R. McGinnis to accommodate this species in 1983.  In 2013, Lecythophora was recombined with Coniochaeta, with all species transferred to the latter genus.

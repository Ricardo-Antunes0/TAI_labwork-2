The Skyluck was a 3,500-ton Panamanian-registered freighter that was hijacked on 25 October 1989 en route from the Port of Amsterdam to the Persian Gulf.  The Skyluck was hijacked by four men, all of whom were Iranian nationals, and were demanding the release of six Iranian nationals, who were also aboard the ship. The hijackers threatened to blow up the ship if their demands were not met.  The Skyluck was released after five days and made it to its destination without incident. The hijackers were never found.

The Broom-Braden Stone House is a historic house located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. It was built in 1738, and is a 2 1/2-story, five bay, stone structure with a gable roof. The facade features an entrance with a round-arch opening flanked by Tuscan order pilasters. The house was originally built as a homestead for Nicholas Braden, and it is one of the few surviving structures from Lancaster's early colonial period. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.

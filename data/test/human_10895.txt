The Queens Building was an office building at London Heathrow Airport next to Heathrow Terminal 2. It was opened in 1955 by Queen Elizabeth II and was demolished in 2009 to make room for a rebuilt Terminal 2. It was the location of the operational offices of BAA until demolition. History  The Queens Building was built as part of a new central area for London Airport (as Heathrow was known at the time). It was designed in 1950 by Frederick Gibberd. Though it was initially going to be named "Eastern Apex Building", upon opening by Queen Elizabeth II it was announced it would be named the "Queens Building" after the Queen.  The office buildings held the airport's administration, as well as airline offices and the only business and conference centre on airport property. In 1956, it was one of the most visited attractions in London due to its runway viewing platforms and rooftop gardens. It was a very popular location with plane spotters. The Queens Building was also constructed with an immigration detention facility designed for holding immigration offenders short-term for up to five days. This facility was in use until 1994 when a new immigration detention centre was opened at Cayley House on the Heathrow campus.

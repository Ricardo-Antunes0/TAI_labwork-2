The Snake River Aquifer is a large underground water resource located in the United States. The aquifer is located in three states, Idaho, Wyoming and Utah, and has a total area of about 2.7 million acres (11,000 km2). The aquifer is also known as the Snake River Plain Aquifer, the Ogden Aquifer, or the Great Basin Aquifer.  The Snake River Aquifer is one of the most important water resources in the United States. It supplies water to parts of three states—Idaho, Wyoming and Utah—and has an estimated capacity of about 20 trillion gallons (761 km3). The aquifer is also important for its agricultural potential. About a fifth of the crops grown in the United States are grown in areas that rely on the Snake River Aquifer.  The Snake River Aquifer was formed about 10,000 years ago when glaciers retreated and Lake Bonneville drained. The water in the aquifer flows downhill to underground reservoirs, where it is stored until it is needed. Over time, the water in the aquifer has been used to irrigate crops and for drinking and irrigation purposes.

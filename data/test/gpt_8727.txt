Igor Alexandrovitch Lintchevski  (June 16, 1908 â€“ October 25, 1976) was a Soviet mathematician and theoretical physicist. He made fundamental contributions to the theory of nonlinear differential equations and chaos theory.  Lintchevski was born in Kiev, then part of the Russian Empire. He graduated from Leningrad University in 1930 with a degree in mathematics. After working as a researcher at the Ioffe Physical Technical Institute, he moved to the United States in 1951, where he became a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He returned to the Soviet Union in 1956, and died there in 1976.  Lintchevski is best known for his work on nonlinear differential equations and chaos theory. In 1936, he developed an iterative method for solving systems of nonlinear differential equations that is now known as Lintchevski's algorithm. His work on chaotic systems introduced the concept of fractals and led to the discovery of self-similarity in patterns observed in chaotic systems.

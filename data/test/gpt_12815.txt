Electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) is a transducer technology that converts acoustic energy into an electric field or vice versa. The device is based on the principles of electromagnetism and acoustics and has the ability to generate low-frequency sound waves or high-frequency sound waves. EMATs are used in a variety of applications, including communication, defense, and environmental monitoring.

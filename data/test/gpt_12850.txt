Papers, Please is a puzzle simulation video game developed and published by Lucas Pope. The game was released for Microsoft Windows and macOS in 2015, and for Linux in 2016. The player controls a border control officer at a fictional immigration checkpoint between the fictional countries of Arstotzka and Kolechia. Their job is to check the immigration papers of people passing through the checkpoint, and to make sure that only legal residents are allowed entry.  The game is set in an Orwellian world of surveillance and control, in which the authorities demand complete access to the lives of their citizens. As the border control officer, the player must weigh the costs and benefits of enforcing the rules against those who would attempt to circumvent them. They must also consider the impact of their decisions on the people around them, as well as on their own conscience.  Pope developed Papers, Please while working as a software developer in Prague. He initially created it as a Ludum Dare game entry, but later expanded it into a full game. The game was funded through Kickstarter and released in 2015. It received mixed reviews from critics; while some praised its unique setting and gameplay, others found it repetitive and confusing. However, it was commercially successful, grossing over $2 million in sales by 2018.

Essendon railway station is located on the tracks of the North East line of the Melbourne metropolitan railway network in Essendon, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The station is served by five trains an hour on weekdays and four trains an hour on weekends.  The station was opened on 4 July 1872 by the Victorian Railways. It was initially named Essendon Junction, but was renamed Essendon railway station on 1 January 1893. The original Essendon station building, designed by George Allen & Son, was replaced by a new building in 1911. The building was demolished in 1987 and replaced with a car park.  In May 2018 it was announced that Essendon would receive a $4 million upgrade that would include new signs and LED lighting.

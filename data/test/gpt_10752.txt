SEC v. Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d 159 (2d Cir. 2010), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the SEC's use of a civil asset forfeiture proceeding to obtain a judgment against Rajaratnam for insider trading was constitutional.  Rajaratnam was convicted of insider trading in March 2009 and sentenced to 11 years in prison. The SEC filed a civil asset forfeiture suit against him in November 2008, seeking to recover $53 million worth of assets that the agency alleged Rajaratnam had acquired with ill-gotten gains from his insider trading. The assets were seized by the government after Rajaratnam failed to appear in court to contest the SEC's claim.  The Second Circuit upheld the SEC's use of the civil asset forfeiture proceeding in its decision on Rajaratnam's appeal. The court found that the proceeding was a valid exercise of the SEC's authority to punish violators of securities law and that the property subject to forfeiture was legitimately acquired by Rajaratnam with ill-gotten gains from his insider trading.

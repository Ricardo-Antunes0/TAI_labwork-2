Circus schools are institutions that offer professional training in circus arts. They typically offer advanced training in circus performance, circus administration, circus arts teaching, and circus business.  Circus schools first appeared in Europe in the 18th century and were originally used to teach young boys the art of circuses. Today, most circus schools offer a range of professional training programs, including advanced training in circus performance, circus administration, circus arts teaching, and circus business.   Many Circus schools have strong connections to professional circuses and often work with professional circuses to provide training and development opportunities for their students.

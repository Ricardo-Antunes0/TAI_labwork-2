Hellmuth Stachel (born October 6, 1942 in Graz, Austria) is an Austrian mathematician, a Professor of Geometry at the Technical University of Vienna, who is known due to his contributions to geometry, kinematics and computer-aided design. Biography  Hellmuth Stachel was born on October 6, 1942 in Graz to the family of primary school teachers. He graduated from an elementary school in Trofaiach and secondary school (gymnasium) in Leoben. In 1965 he graduated from the University of Graz and Graz University of Technology, obtaining a diploma of a school teacher in “mathematics” and “descriptive geometry.” As a Ph.D. student of Graz University he majored in “mathematics, astronomy and philosophy.” His doctoral advisor was Professor Fritz Hohenberg. Hellmuth Stachel obtained his doctorate in 1969 from Graz University and passed thought habilitation in 1971 at the Technical University of Graz. In 1980 he moved to the Vienna University of Technology.

Professor Stachel takes an active part in the work of “International Society for Geometry and Graphics” (ISGG). In 1990 he was elected a chairman and, in 1994, a vice-president of the society. In 1996 he has created the scientific journal Journal for Geometry and Graphics and since then serves it as the Editor-in-Chief.

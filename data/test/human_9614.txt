"Antología"  is a song by Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira, taken from her third studio album Pies Descalzos. It was released in 1997 by Sony Music and Columbia Records as the fifth single from the album. The song was written and produced by Shakira, with additional production from Luis Fernando Ochoa. "Antología" is a Latin pop ballad that lyrically discusses an appreciation for the knowledge a lover has shared. It is one of Shakira's signature songs in Latin America. Background In 1990, a thirteen-year-old Shakira signed a recording contract with Sony Music and released her debut studio album Magia in 1991, which largely consisted of tracks she had written since she was eight years old. Commercially, the project struggled, selling an underwhelming 1,200 copies in her native Colombia. Her follow-up record Peligro was released in 1993, and suffered a similar failure. Consequently, Shakira took a two-year hiatus, allowing her to complete her high school education.

Thomas Joseph Kickham (March 11, 1901 – December 5, 1971) was an American author and screenwriter, perhaps best known for his mystery novels. He also wrote screenplays for more than twenty films.  Kickham was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, the son of Margaret (née Currier) and Thomas Joseph Kickham, a carpenter. He attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst and then served in the United States Army during World War I. After the war, he worked as a reporter for "The Boston Globe" and then as a staff writer for "The New York Times".  In 1935, Kickham wrote his first mystery novel, "The Mask of Dimitrios", which was published by Doubleday. The novel was well received and helped to launch Kickham's career as an author. He continued to write mysteries throughout the remainder of his life.  Kickham also wrote screenplays for more than twenty films, most notably the 1954 film adaptation of "The Catcher in the Rye", which was directed by Billy Wilder and starred Holden Caulfield and Marlon Brando. Kickham's other notable screenplays include "Sabrina", "Dial M for Murder", "The Night of the Hunter", and "Psycho".

Energy, nutrients, and contaminants derived from aquatic ecosystems and transferred to terrestrial ecosystems are termed aquatic-terrestrial subsidies or, more simply, aquatic subsidies. Common examples of aquatic subsidies include organisms that move across habitat boundaries and deposit their nutrients as they decompose in terrestrial habitats or are consumed by terrestrial predators, such as spiders, lizards, birds, and bats. Aquatic insects that develop within streams and lakes before emerging as winged adults and moving to terrestrial habitats contribute to aquatic subsidies. Fish removed from aquatic ecosystems by terrestrial predators are another important example. Conversely, the flow of energy and nutrients from terrestrial ecosystems to aquatic ecosystems are considered terrestrial subsidies; both aquatic subsidies and terrestrial subsidies are types of cross-boundary subsidies. Energy and nutrients are derived from outside the ecosystem where they are ultimately consumed. Allochthonous describes resources and energy derived from another ecosystem; aquatic-terrestrial subsidies are examples of allochthonous resources. Autochthonous resources are produced by plants or algae within the local ecosystem  Allochthonous resources, including aquatic-terrestrial subsidies, can subsidize predator populations and increase predator impacts on prey populations, sometimes initiating trophic cascades. Nutritional quality of autochthnous and allochthonous resources influences their use by animals and other consumers, even when they are readily available.

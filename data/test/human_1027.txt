This list includes people with natural red hair. Red or ginger hair may come in a variety of shades - from  strawberry blond to  auburn. With only 2% of the population having red hair, red is the rarest natural hair-coloration. The list includes people who have dyed their red hair into another colour or whose red hair has gone grey with age, but excludes people with hair dyed red (such as Tori Amos, Amanda Blake, David Bowie, Ann-Margret, Lucille Ball, Rita Hayworth, Debby Ryan, and Sophie Turner). Figures from the Bible (such as Esau or Judas Iscariot) or from classical mythology appear in the list, which however excludes characters from modern fiction such as Anne of Green Gables or Ginger Hebblethwaite.

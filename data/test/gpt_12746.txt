Price controls are restrictions set in place on the prices of goods and services in order to maintain a certain level of inflation or deflation. Price controls may be imposed by governments, businesses, unions, or consumers.  Price controls can be used to maintain a stable currency or to ensure that necessities such as food and medical supplies are affordable for all. They can also be used to prevent monopolies from forming and to protect the interests of the poor. Price controls can lead to shortages, which can cause prices to rise even further.

"Different Drum" is a song written by Bruce Springsteen and recorded by the E Street Band for their album Born to Run (1975). The song was released as the album's third single in December 1975.  "Different Drum" is a blue-eyed soul song, with Springsteen singing about the down-and-out life of an American city. The lyrics explore themes of alienation and desperation, and are based on Springsteen's experiences of growing up in New Jersey.  The song was a critical and commercial success, charting at number two on the US charts and reaching number one in several other countries. It has since been frequently featured in live performances by the E Street Band, and has been recorded by a number of other artists.

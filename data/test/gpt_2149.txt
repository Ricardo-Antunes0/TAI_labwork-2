In time series analysis, dynamic time warping (DTW) is a technique for estimating the changes in time series over time. DTW is used, for example, to detect trends and to estimate the effect of events on the time series.  DTW is a Bayesian inference method that is based on a priori assumptions about the changes in the data. The method estimates a posterior distribution of time series change after accounting for uncertainty in these assumptions.  DTW can be used to model time series as a function of time, space, or both. The method can be used to analyze spatiotemporal data, such as location data or event data.

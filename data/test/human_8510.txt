Arisaema candidissimum is a species of flowering plant in the arum family (Araceae), originating in western China (Tibet, Sichuan, Yunnan).  Various English names have been given to the species, including Chinese cobra lily and Chinese jack-in-the-pulpit.  The Chinese name is  (bai bao nan xing). Description It is usually described as growing from tubers, although the AGS Encyclopaedia of Alpines says that most Arisaema species grow from corms "often  described wrongly as tubers". It does not appear above the ground until late spring or early summer (typically June in the British Isles). The inflorescence is produced before the leaves open fully and is of the usual aroid shape. The small flowers are at the base of a thin spadix which is surrounded by a hood-like spathe. The spathe is  long, on a stem about  tall. It varies in colour, typically being white, often pinkish or greenish white or cream, with stripes which are green on the outside and pink on the inside. The leaves are about  long with three lobes, each up to  long.

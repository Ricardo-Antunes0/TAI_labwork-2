Henry "Harry" Collinge Speakman (19 January 1864 â€“ 2 January 1915) was an English rugby union utility back who played club rugby for Runcorn. Although never capped at international level in his own country, in 1888 Speakman was chosen to tour New Zealand and Australia as part of the first British Isles team. Speakman later settled in Australia and played rugby for the several local teams as well as being selected to play for Queensland. Early history Speakman was born in Leinster Gardens in Runcorn in 1864 to Anne Elizabeth Speakman. At the time of the 1871 census, his mother was listed as the head of the household, with no father present, with Speakman sharing the family home with two elder and younger siblings. Speakman started playing rugby as a youth, representing local junior teams. He soon found his way into the second XV of Runcorn Football Club and after a season he was playing as fullback for the first team.

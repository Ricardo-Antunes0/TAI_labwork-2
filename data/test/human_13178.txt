Croydon University Hospital, known from 1923 to 2002 as Mayday Hospital and from 2002 to 2010 as Croydon Hospital, is a large NHS hospital in Thornton Heath in south London, England run by Croydon Health Services NHS Trust. It is a District General Hospital with a 24-hour Accident and Emergency department. The hospital is based on a  site in Thornton Heath to the north of central Croydon. History The hospital's roots are as the infirmary of the Croydon Workhouse opened in Mayday Road by the Rt. Rev. Edward Benson, Archbishop of Canterbury, in May 1885. It replaced the previous infirmary in Duppas Hill. The Croydon Union Infirmary was renamed Mayday Hospital (though usually referred to as Mayday Road Hospital) in June 1923. Under the terms of the Local Government Act 1929, it was taken over by Croydon Corporation in April 1932; and then by the National Health Service in July 1948. The name was changed to Croydon Hospital in 2002 and was changed again to Croydon University Hospital in 2010. The hospital had sometimes been referred to as "Maydie" Hospital, which some felt had been a contributing factor to the rebranding.

While Marxism had a significant impact on the development of socialism, it was not the only socialist movement that existed before Marx. Pre-Marx socialists such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Mikhail Bakunin, and Peter Kropotkin fought for different ideas concerning socialism and its implications.  Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was a French philosopher and political economist who is considered the founder of anarchism. He argued that property is theft, and proposed a system of mutualism in which property would be replaced by contract.  Mikhail Bakunin was a Russian revolutionary, philosopher, and social theorist who is considered the founder of anarchism. He argued that humans are naturally hierarchical and that society should be based on voluntary association instead of coercion.  Peter Kropotkin was a Russian scientist, anarchist, and geographer who is considered the founder of anarcho-primitivism. He argued that human beings are naturally cooperative and that society should be based on Mutual aid instead of competition.

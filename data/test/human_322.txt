Christina Milian is the self-titled debut studio album by American singer Christina Milian released by Murder Inc. Records and The Island Def Jam Music Group on October 9, 2001. Its US release was postponed due to the September 11 attacks, which occurred just weeks before its intended release date. Her label still opted to release it in Europe, but the album was never released in North America. However, as of 2020, the album has been made available on streaming services in the United States. A deluxe edition of the album was also made available. Milian made her first professional musical appearance on Ja Rule's single "Between Me and You", which led to a record deal with Def Soul in 2000. Milian traveled to Sweden where she collaborated with several producers, most notably Bloodshy & Avant, who helmed five tracks. Milian co-wrote eleven of the twelve songs on the album, taking inspiration from personal experiences. The album's musical style is mostly dance and R&B, and critics noted similarities to her contemporaries Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Milian was displeased by Def Soul's portrayal of her image, which she felt was constantly changing and confusing the audience.

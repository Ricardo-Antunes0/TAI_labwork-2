Shabana is a traditional celebration undertaken by women in honor of the Goddess Shabana. The celebration usually takes place on the night of the full moon in the month of Shaaban, during which women sing and dance to celebrate their fertility and love.  Shabana celebrations often involve feasting, drinking and dancing until late into the night. Some women also take part in traditional beauty treatments, such as henna tattoos and hair dyeing, to prepare themselves for the celebrations.

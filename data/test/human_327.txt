The Devil's Arrows are four standing stones or menhirs in an alignment approximately  to the east of the A1(M), adjacent to Roecliffe Lane, Boroughbridge in North Yorkshire, England, near to where the A1 road now crosses the River Ure . They have been designated as a scheduled monument since 1923. Site Erected in prehistoric times and distinctively grooved by millennia of rainfall, the tallest stone is  in height, making this the tallest menhir in the United Kingdom after the  tall Rudston Monolith in the East Riding of Yorkshire. The other two stones are  and  tall respectively, and it is thought that the alignment originally included up to five stones. William Camden mentions four stones in his Britannia, noting that "one was lately pulled downe by some that hoped, though in vaine, to finde treasure." One was apparently displaced during a failed 'treasure hunt' during the 18th century and later used as the base for a nearby bridge over a river. The stones are composed of millstone grit, the most likely source of which is Plumpton Rocks two miles south of Knaresborough, and about nine miles from where the stones stand today.

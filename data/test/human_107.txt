Thihapate of Sagaing (, ; also Minbyauk Thihapate, ; 1305–1364) king of Sagaing from 1352 to 1364. He came to power by being married to the powerful Princess Soe Min Kodawgyi. He led Sagaing during the most tumultuous period of the kingdom (1356−64). Despite a brief period of alliance with Pinya (1357−59), Sagaing had to face near-annual raids by the northern Shan state of Mong Mao (Maw) on its own. He lost power in April 1364 when Maw Shan forces sacked Sagaing. He escaped capture but was soon put to death by his stepson Thado Minbya at Kya-Khat-Wa-Ya, south of Sagaing. Early life Little is known about his early life or ancestry except that he was a grandson of the elder sister of Queen Pwa Saw of Pagan. This means that he was a grandson of Queen Yadanabon and King Narathihapate of Pagan. Since his father was a minister at the Sagaing court, Thihapate likely entered the service of Sagaing monarchs. Then in late 1351/early 1352, he married a recently widowed Princess Soe Min, daughter of the founder of the kingdom Saw Yun. It is unclear if his marriage to Soe Min preceded the death of Soe Min's brother King Tarabya II, who died at age 25 in February 1352 and left no heirs apparent to take over the throne. With no heirs apparent ready to take over, the court elected Thihapate king (or regent). His marriage to Soe Min may have been part of the election process.

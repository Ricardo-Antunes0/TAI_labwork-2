Riverside Military Academy is a private, college preparatory, boarding and day school for boys in grades 6 through 12 in Gainesville, Georgia, United States. History  Riverside Military Academy was founded in 1907 by local Professors and Businessmen- Haywood Jefferson Pearce and Azor Warner Van Hoose, Jr  with the mission of preparing ethical young men for success in college and life. Riverside officially opened its doors during the Fall of 1908, but would not gain prominence until 1913 when a young Professor from Stone Mountain, GA: Professor Edgar Dunlap "Sandy" Beaver (later General)  became the Director of Riverside Military Academies' Academics and Military Department. Riverside had a Winter campus in Hollywood, Florida, which briefly was used as a Naval Air Gunners School during WWII,  from 1931 until 1984, when it was sold. The Gainesville campus underwent renovations from 1997 until 2004, adding a new barracks building, academics building, gymnasium, and a library and performing arts center.

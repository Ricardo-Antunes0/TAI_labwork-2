The Butterfly Cluster (cataloged as Messier 6) is a loose group of young, interacting galaxies located in the constellation Lepus. It was discovered by Philippe Loys de Chéseaux in 1764.  The Butterfly Cluster is a loose group of young galaxies located in the constellation Lepus. It was discovered by Philippe Loys de Chéseaux in 1764. The cluster is composed of about 150 galaxies, most of which are less than 100 million years old. The cluster is thought to have formed from the collision of two smaller galaxies some 10 billion years ago.  The cluster is often used as an example of a spiral galaxy cluster because it contains a large number of well-defined spirals. The cluster also contains a high percentage of elliptical galaxies, which are thought to be intermediate between spiral and square-shaped galaxies. The cluster is also home to a high concentration of supermassive black holes, which are estimated to contain between 10 and 20 billion solar masses.

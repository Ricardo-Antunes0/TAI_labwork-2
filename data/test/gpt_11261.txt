Fujita is known for his work on financial crisis theory and for his contributions to the study of Japanese economic history.  Fujita was born in Tokyo in 1951. He received a B.A. from Keio University in 1974 and a M.A. from the same institution in 1976. In 1978, he received a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, where he was a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research (1978-1981). From 1981 to 1986, he was an associate professor at Keio University, and from 1986 to 1997 he was a professor at Hitotsubashi University.  Fujita has been a visiting scholar at the London School of Economics (1985), the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (1986), and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1987). He has also been a Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (1988), a Guggenheim Fellow (1992), and a member of the Japanese Academy (1996).  Fujita's research has focused on financial crisis theory and Japanese economic history. His most famous book is "The Financial Crisis in Japan" (1995), which has been translated into several languages. In it, Fujita argues that Japan's financial sector went into over-extension during the 1990s, leading to a series of financial crises in which the country's banks were heavily implicated.

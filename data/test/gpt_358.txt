The Bogotá sunangel (Heliangelus zusii) is a butterfly found in the Bogotá savanna in Colombia. It was described by George Hampson in 1892.  The Bogotá sunangel is a medium-sized butterfly, with a wingspan of 34–38 mm. The upperside of the wings is light brown, with a broad central band and a series of shorter lateral bands. The underside is similar but paler, with a series of dark brown spots on the wing margin. The females are slightly larger than the males.  The Bogotá sunangel breeds in open woodland and forest near waterfalls and streams. It is mainly active during the day, but can be seen flying low over the ground at dusk. Its larva feeds on "Asteraceae" plants, including "Achillea", "Agrostis", and "Dipsacus".

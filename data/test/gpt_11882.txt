The regulatory T cells (Tregs  or CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells) are a type of T cell that help to maintain immune homeostasis by regulating the activity of other immune cells. They are also known to play a role in the prevention of autoimmunity.  Tregs were first identified in the 1990s as a type of T cell that could suppress the immune response. They were later found to be important in the prevention of autoimmune diseases, and they are now known to play a role in the maintenance of health overall.  Tregs can be generated from various types of cells in the body, and they are particularly abundant in the skin and lymph nodes. They are important in the activation and regulation of other types of cells, and they have been shown to play a role in the prevention of autoimmune diseases and other types of inflammation.  Tregs are often considered to be beneficial because they can help to keep the immune system under control and prevent inflammation from becoming rampant. They are also often seen as being key players in the prevention of autoimmunity.

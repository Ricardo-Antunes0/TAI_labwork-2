Ben "Lofty" Chiltern is a fictional character and the protagonist of the crime novel series by Jeffery Deaver, featuring the character as a homicide detective.  Lofty Chiltern is a homicide detective in the Los Angeles Police Department's Robbery-Homicide Division. He is described as a "tall, rangy, and powerfully built" man with "a blunt, no-nonsense manner".  The character first appeared in the novel "The Stone Diaries" (1987), and has since appeared in other novels in the series, including "The Vanishing Point" (1988), "The Burning Room" (1991), "The Coffin Maker" (1994), and "The House of Blue Leaves" (1999).

However, due to budgetary constraints, only six episodes were produced before the show was cancelled.

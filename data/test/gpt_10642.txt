808 Mafia is an American record production and hip hop collective, consisting of artists such as Juicy J, G-Unit, and Young Buck. The collective has released three studio albums, including their first in 2007, and has achieved chart success with singles such as "In My Feelings", "Lollipop", and "How Low".  808 Mafia was founded in 2006 by producers Rick Ross, Young Buck, and T.I., who were looking to create a unified Southern rap sound. The group's early releases were well-received and helped them gain a following in the underground hip hop community. Their 2007 album "Money In The Grave" peaked at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart and spawned the successful single "In My Feelings". The album's follow-up, "The Massacre", was less successful, but still managed to chart at number ten. In 2018, 808 Mafia released their third album, "Royal Flush".   The group has been involved in several feuds and altercations with other rappers throughout their career. In 2011, they were involved in a dispute with fellow Georgia rapper Ludacris; the two groups fought each other in several public appearances and online debates. That same year, they were also involved in a conflict with Future over the production on Future's single "Move That Dope". In 2018, they had a public altercation with A$AP Rocky over royalties for the song "L$D".

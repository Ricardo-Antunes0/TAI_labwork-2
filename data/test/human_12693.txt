Toponymy  Belph: It has been suggested this placename derives from Belge meaning 'roaring river', although only gentle flowing streams are in the vicinity. A further claim is one from the Old English term belg meaning 'bag', used in respect of the geography of the area. Another possible form is of Norman/Saxon origin, le bulgh meaning 'gap', possibly in reference to the gorge by the stream nearby. The nameplace itself was not reported in Domesday however, only being first mentioned in public records from 1179.

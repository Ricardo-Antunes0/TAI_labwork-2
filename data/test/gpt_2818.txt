Bone Orchard were a post-punk/gothic rock band from Manchester, England. Formed in 1986, the band consisted of vocalist/guitarist Andy McCluskey, keyboardist Paul Humphreys, drummer Rob Ellis, and bassist Paul Quinn.  Bone Orchard were one of the most influential bands of the post-punk era, releasing six studio albums and two EPs before splitting up in 2002. Their music was characterised by its dark and brooding sound, and they are often cited as pioneers of the gothic rock genre. The band's popularity was secured by their 1988 debut album, "The Black Parade", which reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and spawned the singles "The Ghost of Tom Joad" and "The Fly".  Since their split, McCluskey and Humphreys have continued to work together as part of the band Nitzer Ebb. In 2013, Bone Orchard were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

A bench seat is a full width continuous pad forming the front seat of automobiles.  The second row of seating in most sedans is usually a bench. The third row of most SUVs and minivans, which may be forward-facing or rear-facing, is also a bench seat. Design The front bench seat typically allowed three people to sit abreast, or six passengers in most four-door sedans with this type of arrangement. For example, "although advertised as an economical 'compact' car, the [1952] Willys Aero could comfortably sit three abreast on its front and rear bench seats, and deliver excellent fuel economy." Nash Motors introduced the unique "airliner" reclining front bench seats that would be transformed into a bed. American Motors promoted its exclusive adjustable bench seats on the 1959 Ramblers and Ambassadors featuring several restful positions, including a "comfortable nap couch for children and older adults." In 1972, the Jeep Commando's center console for the automatic transmission was replaced with a steering column mounted shifter, "making the much-requested bench seat an option." The " innovative but unusual " 1975 AMC Pacer introduced numerous designs that included the "cab forward" and "room for three upfront on the bench seat."

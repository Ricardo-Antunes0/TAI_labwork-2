The Spring Grove Experiment is a series of experiments that aimed to test the effects of prenatal and postnatal environment on the development of intelligence.  The experiments were conducted at the Spring Grove State School in Spring Grove, Pennsylvania, from 1924 to 1961. The school was a reform school for boys that was later renamed the Spring Grove Institution. The experiments were conducted by Dr. James McKeen Cattell, who was the head of the psychology department at the school.  The experiments were designed to test whether physical or social environment is more important in the development of intelligence. The experiments consisted of giving birth to babies in different environments and then measuring their intelligence when they were adults. The results of the experiments showed that physical environment is more important than social environment in the development of intelligence.

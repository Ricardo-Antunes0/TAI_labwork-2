Kaunhara ghat is a river bank in Hajipur in the Indian state of Bihar. Kaunhara ghat is one of the main ghats of the Ganga-Gandak rivers. where worship and cremation have been performed side-by-side for centuries. Its name stems from a legend, according to which, the fight of Gaja (elephant)â€“Graah (crocodile), is the reason behind people asking - kaun haara. Lord Vishnu had to interfere to save his devotee Gajaraj from drowning. Both Gaja and Grah were gandharavas. Due to a curse they became Gaja and Graah. Lord Visnu killed Graah to give him instant salvation, and saved Gajaraj. The fight is an emblem for the city, and is prominently depicted on the Hajipur railway station's dome, entry point of Sonepur fair and other notable places. Since Ganga flows from the west and Gandak from the north, they meet at a right angle (Hindi: kondhara). This name was given in the fifth century. Spoken Hindi later evolved and the word changed from Kon to Kaun and Dhara to Hara.

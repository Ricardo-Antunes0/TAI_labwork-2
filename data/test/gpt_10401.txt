The Kanakachalapathi temple is a 16th-century Hindu temple located in Kanakagiri, a town in the Western Guntur district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The temple is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva and is considered one of the holiest sites in Andhra Pradesh.  The temple complex consists of a 16th-century "linga" (phallic symbol) shrine and several other minor shrines. The main shrine is built on a raised platform and contains a sandalwood image of Shiva. The entrance to the shrine is flanked by two Nandi (bulls) statues. The temple is open from 6:00am to 9:00pm daily.  The temple is significant for its association with the Battle of Kanakagiri, which took place in 1565 between the forces of Vijayanagara Empire and the Telugu kingdom of Krishnadevaraya. The battle ended in a victory for Vijayanagara, leading to the subjugation of Telugu territories by the empire.

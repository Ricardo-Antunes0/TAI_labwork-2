During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many people speculated about a possible connection between Mars and Earth. Some suggested that a Martian canal might exist, connecting the two planets.   Although no canal was ever discovered, the speculation inspired many artists and scientists to create hypothetical maps of a possible canal. Today, the idea of a Martian canal is generally considered to be nothing more than a fanciful theory.

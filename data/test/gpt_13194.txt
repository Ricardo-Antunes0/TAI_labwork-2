An invest in meteorology (short for investigative weathering) is the act of making an investment in weather forecasting and/or weather-related research and development.  Investigative weathering is the process of acquiring knowledge about weather and climate through various methods, including observation, experimentation, modeling, and data analysis. It is an important part of the field of meteorology, which deals with the atmospheric sciences. In order to improve forecasts and understand the dynamics of weather systems, investigative weathering practitioners must have a deep understanding of both physical and chemical processes involved in precipitation, atmosphere, Clouds and Earth's Surface.  Investigative weathering can be used to improve our understanding of extreme events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, thunderstorms, and drought. It can also help us improve our forecasts for these events by providing information about how wind speeds and directions change over time, how moisture moves through the atmosphere, and how temperature distributions change on Earth's surface.   Investigative weathering also has important implications for climate change. By understanding how physical and chemical processes interact, investigators can develop models that more accurately predict how climate change will affect extreme weather events.

Coast is a consumer magazine about the British seaside. It was launched as a bi-monthly title in 2004 by Coastal Living Ltd, and was then published by Edisea Ltd, until UK publishing company National Magazines (now Hearst Communications) bought it in 2005. National Magazines continued to publish it bi-monthly as a sister title to Country Living magazine. It increased the number of issues published per year to ten in 2007. The Magazine was taken over by current publishers Kelsey Media in November 2012. The number of issues published per year was increased to twelve in 2014. Coast covers all aspects of living by the sea: homes, gardens, travel, food and health. The magazine was formerly headquartered in London. It is based in Kent. The Coast Awards Every year the magazine celebrates the best of the British coastline in the Coast Awards, sponsored by Joules Clothing. The winners of each of the ten categories are usually announced in the June issue of the magazine. From 2008-2011, the Awards have been reader nominated and a panel of expert judges has decided on the winners from a short list. Past presenters of the Coast Awards ceremony have included Michaela Strachan and Julia Bradbury.

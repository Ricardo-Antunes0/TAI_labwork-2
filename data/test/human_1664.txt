Gussie Nell Davis (November 4, 1906 – December 21, 1993) was an American teacher best known as the founder of the Kilgore College Rangerettes, who in September 1940 became the first all-girls drill team to perform on a college football field. Biography Davis was born on November 4, 1906, in Farmersville, Texas. She was the daughter of Robert Augustus and Mattie Lavinia (née Callaway) Davis. Davis went to public schools in Farmersville, and enrolled at the Texas Woman's University (then the College of Industrial Arts) in 1923, where she advanced an intention to become a concert pianist. Her mother had taught her music from an early age but her dancing style was not widely accepted in the South-Central United States. As a result, she switched her studies from music to physical education, which went against the wishes of both her parents. Davis graduated in 1927 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and began her professional career the following year at Greenville High School as an instructor of physical education, and pep squad sponsor.

The S-Phone system was a UHF duplex mobile telephone system developed and marketed by South Korea's Samsung Electronics. Launched in 1995, it was one of the earliest commercial cellular systems.  The S-Phone system used the same frequency as Korea's landline telephone service, allowing seamless integration of the two systems. The system supported up to 128 subscribers and offered a variety of features not available on other cellular systems at the time, such as call waiting and a reverse directory.  In 2002, the S-Phone network was shut down due to competition from GSM and CDMA networks.

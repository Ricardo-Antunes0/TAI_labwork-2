The Cosmic Connection: An Extraterrestrial Perspective is a book about the connection between the universe and the human mind. Written by acclaimed author Ervin Laszlo, The Cosmic Connection explores the evidence that suggests we are not alone in the universe, and presents a unique perspective on why our brains work the way they do.  Laszlo argues that our brains are actually designed specifically to interface with extraterrestrial intelligence. He presents evidence from a wide range of disciplines, including psychology, neurology, physics, and mathematics, to support his theory that we are actively engaged in a cosmic dialogue with beings from other galaxies.  This book is not just another theory about extraterrestrial life; it is based on concrete evidence and rigorous analysis. If you're interested in learning about our cosmic connection, The Cosmic Connection is the book for you.

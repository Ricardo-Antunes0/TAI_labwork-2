Brants's whistling rat or Brants' whistling rat (Parotomys brantsii) is one of two species of murid rodent in the genus Parotomys. It is found in Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa where its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry shrubland and pastureland. It was first described in 1834 by the Scottish zoologist Andrew Smith who named it in honour of the Dutch zoologist and author Anton Brants. Description   Brants's whistling rat is a fairly large species with a short, blunt head. Males have a head-and-body length of about  while females are a little smaller. The tail is about two thirds the length of the head-and-body. The tail measures 7.5 to 10.5Â cm. The head is greyish-white, with a rufous snout and forehead. The ears are large and rounded, with dark skin and short hairs. The fur is dense and soft; the dorsal pelage is yellowish, speckled with brownish-black, individual hairs having dark grey bases and yellowish tips. There is also a scattering of long, pure black hairs, especially along the spine. The flanks are rather paler, and the ventral pelage is pale grey, the individual hairs having pale grey bases and whitish or pale yellow tips. The legs are short, the feet having long, narrow claws and four digits on the front feet and five on the hind feet. The tail is well-covered with hair, being dark brown above and orangish-red on the sides and underneath.

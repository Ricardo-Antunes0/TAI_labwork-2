Antigenic drift is a kind of genetic variation that can occur in populations of microbes, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It is caused by the accidental exchange of genes between different species of microbes. Antigenic drift can lead to the development of new strains of infections that are resistant to existing treatments.

ELMER (Easier and more Efficient Reporting), is a style guideline for reporting scientific results in scientific journals.  ELMER was originally proposed by Dr. Elmer E. Lamb in the early 1980s as a means of improving the clarity and consistency of scientific reports. ELMER has since been adopted by many journals as their reporting standard.  The ELMER guidelines are made up of four main components: title, abstract, methods, and results. Each component is important and should be presented in a clear, concise, and consistent manner.  When following the ELMER guidelines, scientists can improve the clarity and accuracy of their reports by following these simple tips:  Title: Use a title that is concise and informative. The title should reflect the content of the article without being too long or complex. Try to use keywords that are relevant to the article’s topic.  Abstract: The abstract is a brief overview of the article that can be read quickly. It should be written in an easy-to-read style that is free from technical jargon. The abstract should not exceed 150 words.  Methods: The methods section should describe the study’s design and procedures in detail. It should include information about how the data were collected and analyzed.  Results: The results section should report the findings of the study in a clear and concise manner. This section should include any new findings that have not been mentioned in the other sections of the article.

Fibulin (FY-beau-lin) (now known as Fibulin-1 FBLN1) is a type I collagen peptide that is encoded by the FBLN1 gene. Fibulin is synthesized as a single chain molecule, with a molecular weight of 29,000 daltons. The protein has a predicted amino acid sequence that is 97% identical to collagen type I. Fibulin is synthesized by the fibroblast and is concentrated in the extracellular matrix (ECM), where it contributes to the strength and elasticity of tissues.

Article 99 is a 1992 American comedy-drama film directed by Howard Deutch and written by Ron Cutler. It was produced by Orion Pictures and stars Kiefer Sutherland, Ray Liotta, Forest Whitaker, John C. McGinley, Rutanya Alda and Lea Thompson. The soundtrack was composed by Danny Elfman. The film's title supposedly refers to a legal loophole, which states that unless an illness/injury is related to military service, a veteran is not eligible for VA hospital benefits. Plot Peter Morgan (Kiefer Sutherland), a young doctor, starts a new job at Monument Heights Veterans' Hospital in Washington, D.C. The government-funded hospital is suffering from cutbacks upheld by Executive Director Dr. Henry Dreyfoos (John Mahoney). Morgan only plans to work in the hospital temporarily before starting private practice. On his first day, Morgan finds himself out of his depth working amidst the chaos. One of the patients, veteran ‘Shooter’ Polaski (Leo Burmester), snaps after being given an Article 99 form, which states the hospital finds the patient ineligible for immediate treatment because the supposed ailment is not service-related. Polaski proceeds to drive through the hospital's entrance and starts a shooting rampage with his M16. A group of doctors led by Dr. Richard Sturgess (Ray Liotta) are able to disarm Polaski.

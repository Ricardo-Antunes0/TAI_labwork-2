María Micaela Guyunusa (September 28, 1806 in Montevideo – March 2, 1865 in Buenos Aires) was an Argentine writer, journalist and feminist.  Guyunusa was born to a modest family of merchants from Montevideo. She received her early education at home and then studied law at the University of the Andes in Lima, Peru. After returning to Montevideo in 1829, she began her career as a journalist. Her first work, a satirical poem entitled "El cerdo" (The Pig), appeared in 1829 in the newspaper "El Mercurio".   In 1830 she married Dr. Manuel Guyunusa, an Italian physician. The couple had four children before Manuel died in 1841. Guyunusa then began to write novels and poetry with a more personal touch. Her most famous work is the novel "Los viñedos de los Andes" (The Winegrowers of the Andes), which was published in five volumes between 1844 and 1849.   Guyunusa also wrote essays on various social issues, including women's rights and the emancipation of slaves. In 1853 she became the editor of the newspaper "La Nación". Five years later she moved to Buenos Aires, where she worked until her death in 1865.

Francesco Sisci (August 5, 1960) is an Italian painter and sculptor. He was born in Naples. After studies at the Academy of Fine Arts of Naples, he moved to Rome in the late 1980s, where he worked extensively with the painter Luciano Fabro. In 1992 he exhibited his first solo show at the Palazzo delle Esposizioni in Rome. He has since exhibited extensively throughout Italy, Europe and North America, and his work is held in many public and private collections.  Sisci's paintings depict a world of intense beauty and serenity, characterized by its lyrical intensity and its capacity to transport the viewer into a realm of profound contemplation. His sculptures are often composed of delicate pieces of machinery or natural objects that seem to be in motion, lending his works an air of organic fragility.

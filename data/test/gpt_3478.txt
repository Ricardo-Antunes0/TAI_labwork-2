Shuttle-Centaur was a version of the  Shuttle bus concept that was developed in the late 1990s by  the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The  vehicle would have been a low-emission, hybrid-electric bus that would have  traveled on dedicated lanes on the surface of highways. The shuttle-centaur would  have been able to travel at speeds of up to 100 mph and could have carried as many as  400 passengers.

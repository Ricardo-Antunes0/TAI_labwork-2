The steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) protein   Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) is a protein that, in humans, is encoded by the SF-1 gene. SF-1 is a transcriptional activator that is essential for the growth and development of certain tissues in the body, including the liver, pancreas, and testes.  SF-1 was first identified in 1979 as a protein that was required for the synthesis of steroids by the liver. Since its discovery, SF-1 has been shown to be involved in a number of important processes in the body, including the regulation of lipid metabolism and the expression of genes related to cancer and reproduction. In addition, SF-1 has been shown to play a role in the development of several diseases, including diabetes and cancer.

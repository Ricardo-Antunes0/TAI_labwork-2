SOX12 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SOX12 gene. SOX12 is a member of the SR-X-linked gene family, which contains several proteins implicated in craniofacial development and function. SOX12 is expressed in the early weeks of human development and is thought to be involved in the formation of the cranial neural crest.  SOX12 has been shown to play a role in craniofacial development by controlling the expression of other genes involved in craniofacial development. SOX12 is also thought to be responsible for the formation of the cranial neural crest, a population of cells that forms the roof of the skull and other cranial bones.

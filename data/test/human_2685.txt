Patrick Aloysius Murphy (21 June 1918 â€“ 2 September 1973), known as Weesh Murphy, was an Irish Gaelic football player, selector and administrator. Throughout a club career that spanned over 20 years, he played for several clubs in Cork and Dublin and enjoyed championship success in different grades with Bere Island, Lees Football Club and divisional side Beara. At inter-county level, he was full-back on the Cork senior football team that won the 1945 All-Ireland Championship; he had earlier won the first of four Munster Championship medals and ended his career with a National League title. As well as club and county successes, Murphy was a regular for Munster over an eight-year period and won three Railway Cup medals. His inter-county career was followed by several periods as a team selector, while he also became involved in administrative affairs as chairman of the Cork County Board and the Munster Council. Murphy is widely considered one of the best players of his generation, and among the greatest of all time, as well as being regarded by many in the sport as Cork's greatest ever full-back. A Cork Examiner obituary stated that he was a "powerfully built robust figure" and "one of the most consistently dependable footballers Cork has produced." Murphy was posthumously named in the full-back position on the Cork Team of the Century in 1984 and the Cork Team of the Millennium in 2000.

La Sierra Academy (LSA) is a private, co-educational, transitional kindergartenâ€“12th grade Christian school in Riverside, California. La Sierra Academy's mission statement states: "As a Christian K - 12 college preparatory school, we serve students from diverse backgrounds by providing the learning opportunities and skills needed to contribute to society, to prepare for life's work, and to flourish spiritually." LSA is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system. History La Sierra Academy was founded in the fall of 1922 as a secondary school. The land on which it was founded was formerly part of the 1846 Mexican land grant, Rancho La Sierra. La Sierra Academy's first school bulletin from 1922 stated that its students would "learn to render effective service." The school grew into a junior college and later into a full four year liberal arts college. This shift created a need to separate the academy into other academic levels. Thus in 1940, La Sierra College Preparatory School, now known as La Sierra University, was established.  In 1955 the school moved to its current location along Pierce Street and Golden Avenue less than a mile away from the University.

The Barrytown Trilogy, later also referred to as the Barrytown Trilogy, is a three-book series written by American author Stephen King. The series is set in the fictional town of Barrytown, Maine, and tells the stories of three children—Bobby, Georgie, and Teddy—whose lives are disrupted by the arrival of a mysterious stranger, known only as the Man with the Red Hat.  King completed the trilogy in 1989, but it was not published until 2004. The books have since been released as a single volume under the title Everything's Eventual. The series has been praised for its atmospheric writing and its incorporation of elements of horror and suspense.

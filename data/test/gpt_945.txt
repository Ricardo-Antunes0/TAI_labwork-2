Young Figuratives was the title of two exhibitions of young British and international artists held in 1987 and 1988 at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London. The exhibitions were jointly presented by the ICA and the Royal Academy of Arts.  The term "young figurative" is used to describe a generation of artists who emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This generation is characterized by its exploration of new ways of depicting the human figure, through both formal and conceptual means. The artists featured in the exhibitions represented a wide range of nationalities and artistic backgrounds, ranging from established veterans such as David Hockney and Francis Bacon to relatively unknown figures such as Doreen Aldridge and Tamsin Greig.  The exhibitions were financially unsuccessful, but they have since been seen as important milestones in the development of British art during the late 1980s. They helped to introduce a new wave of young artists to the public, and also helped to establish the reputation of some of Britain's most promising upcoming talent.

The Pretender: Rebirth is the first novel based on the cult television show The Pretender, which ran on NBC from 1996 to 2000. Following the series' cancellation, TNT produced two television movies, The Pretender 2001 and The Pretender: Island of the Haunted. The book is the first of an intended new series. It is written by series creators Steven Long Mitchell and Craig W. Van Sickle who have promised in a 2013 interview to answer fans' long-standing questions that were left unanswered in the TV series and both TV movies, such as the mystery of Miss Parker's parentage and actual first name, to name a few. Premise Based on the same premise as that of The Pretender TV series, Jarod is a genius, a Pretender and he has escaped the facility (The Centre) where he was raised from a very young age, having no memory of his parents. He can become anyone that he wants to be but he does not know who he is. He spends his time outside of The Centre, doing good and defending the "weak and abused" to make up for the heinous deeds performed by The Centre using his simulations.

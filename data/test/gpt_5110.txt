The obol (, obolos, also  ὀβελός or βέλος, meaning "dime") was a unit of currency in the ancient Greek world, first adopted in Athens around 600 BC. Its name comes from the obolus, a small bronze coin worth one-seventh of a drachma. The obol was subdivided into twelve minae.  The obol was replaced by the drachma in the later Roman world.

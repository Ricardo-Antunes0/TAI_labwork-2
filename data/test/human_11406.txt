Caladenia cairnsiana, commonly known as the zebra orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a common and widespread orchid distinguished by its red-striped labellum, and petals and lateral which are pressed against the ovary. Description Caladenia cairnsiana is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which is usually found in scattered groups or sometimes in clumps of more than ten. It has a single hairy leaf,  long and about  wide. There are one or two flowers on the end of a stalk  tall, each flower  long and about  wide. The flowers are greenish-yellow with red markings. The lateral sepals and the petals hang down against the ovary. The labellum is inclined upwards, is red-striped, has a smooth edge and a glandular tip. In the centre of the labellum is a band of deep purple-red calli. Flowering occurs between August and early November and is followed by a non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing a large number of seeds.

The True Furqan  is a book by Sayyid Qutb, an influential Islamic thinker and theorist. Written in 1964, it is considered one of the key texts of modern Islamic fundamentalism.  The True Furqan presents an uncompromising, radical interpretation of Islamic theology that has profoundly influenced Islamist thought. Qutb argues that the Qur'an and Sunnah (the practices and sayings of Prophet Muhammad) are the only sources of religious authority and that Muslims must return to a pure, true understanding of Islam if they are to be successful in bringing about Islamic revival.  Qutb's thought has been influential within jihadist movements around the world, and The True Furqan has been cited as a source of inspiration by terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS.

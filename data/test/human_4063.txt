Castille, the New Iberia Broadcasting Company, received a construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission for a new 250-watt, unlimited-time radio station to serve New Iberia on January 9, 1946. The new station permit selected the call letters KNEI before changing to KANE on May 16 of that year.

In the early years of the station, there were several changes of ownership in the New Iberia Broadcasting Company. Dierrell Hamm became a partner in 1952; he sold his stake to Don Bonin in 1957. The station also changed network affiliations from Mutual to ABC in 1952, airing both networks' output for seven months. Ten years later, KANE was approved to increase its power to 1,000 watts during daylight hours.

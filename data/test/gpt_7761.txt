Hans Danuser (born in 1953 in Chur) is an artist who has been working in the medium of photography since the early 1980s. He is particularly known for his black and white photography, as well as his unique and often surrealist approach to the medium.  Danuser was born in Chur, Switzerland in 1953. After studying at the School of Applied Arts in Zurich, he moved to New York City in 1978 to enrol in the School of Visual Arts, where he studied under photographers such as Garry Winogrand and Ralph Gibson. He later moved to Berlin, where he currently lives and works.  Danuser's photographs are characterised by their surrealist elements, which often take the form of dark and foreboding landscapes or night scenes featuring disconcertingly juxtaposed objects. His work has been exhibited in solo exhibitions at venues such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain.

Deep drawing is a sheet metal forming process in which a sheet metal blank is radially drawn into a forming die by the mechanical action of a punch. It is thus a shape transformation process with material retention. The process is considered "deep" drawing when the depth of the drawn part exceeds its diameter. This is achieved by redrawing the part through a series of dies. The flange region (sheet metal in the die shoulder area) experiences a radial drawing stress and a tangential compressive stress due to the material retention property. These compressive stresses (hoop stresses) result in flange wrinkles (wrinkles of the first order). Wrinkles can be prevented by using a blank holder, the function of which is to facilitate controlled material flow into the die radius. Process The total drawing load consists of the ideal forming load and an additional component to compensate for friction in the contacting areas of the flange region and bending forces as well as unbending forces at the die radius. The forming load is transferred from the punch radius through the drawn part wall into the deformation region (sheet metal flange). In the drawn part wall, which is in contact with the punch, the hoop strain is zero whereby the plane strain condition is reached. In reality, mostly the strain condition is only approximately plane. Due to tensile forces acting in the part wall, wall thinning is prominent and results in an uneven part wall thickness, such that the part wall thickness is lowest at the point where the part wall loses contact with the punch, i.e., at the punch radius.

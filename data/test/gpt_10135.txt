Maria Johansdotter, or Maja Jansdotter, also known as Maja Gersdotter, was a Swedish noblewoman and the widow of the governor of the Swedish province of Västerbotten.  Maria Johansdotter was born in 1608 in Torsby, Västerbotten County, Sweden to a wealthy family. She married the governor of Västerbotten, Johan Gersdorff, in 1627. The couple had two children: a son who died in infancy and a daughter who later married the courtier Johan Oxenstierna.  After her husband's death in 1641, Maria Johansdotter became the head of the household and the main financial supporter of her son and daughter-in-law. She died in 1668 at the age of 70.

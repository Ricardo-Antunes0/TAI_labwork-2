The AJS 500cc Model 18 and AJS Model 18S are 500 cc British motorcycles almost identical to the Matchless G80 and both were produced in the same  Associated Motor Cycles (AMC) London factory from 1945 to 1966. These bikes represent the end of the era of big British singles, as when AMC merged with Norton production concentrated on twins. Development The AJS Model 18 was developed from a design from the 1930s, despite which it was still being manufactured 30 years later. The AJS was updated when a springer frame rear suspension was made available for 1949, to become the Model 18S. The suspension was a vast improvement on the rigid rear end - which had given a bouncy ride. Each of the two 'Candlestick' shocks held only 50 cc of SAE 20 weight oil. They were prone to leaks and were replaced by the larger diameter 'Jampot' shocks on the 1951 version.

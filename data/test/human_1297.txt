Akdamut, or Akdamus or Akdamut Milin, or Akdomus Milin (Aramaic: אַקְדָמוּת מִלִּין, "In Introduction to the Words," i.e. to the Aseret ha-dibrot, the Ten Commandments), is a prominent piyyut ("liturgical poem") recited annually on the Jewish holiday of Shavuot by Ashkenazi Jews written in Aramaic. It was penned by Rabbi Meir bar Yitzchak (Nehorai) of Orléans, who was a cantor (prayer leader) in Worms, Germany, (died ca. 1095). Akdamut consists of praise for God, His Torah, and His people. Akdamut is read in almost all Ashkenazi synagogues on the first day of Shavuot during the Torah reading. The original practice was for it to be recited after the reading of the first verse (Exodus 19:1), but in the past few centuries, the practice has developed in many congregations (mainly Eastern European ones) that the poem is read after the kohen has been called to the Torah reading, but before he recites the blessing.

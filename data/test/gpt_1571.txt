A civil conspiracy is a form of conspiracy in which a group of people conspire to commit a crime, without violating the criminal law. The term is also used more generally to describe any agreement or plan, however illegal or unlawful, between two or more people to achieve an objective.  The term "civil conspiracy" first appeared in English in the early 17th century, derived from the French word "conspiration civile", meaning "civil conspiracy". In English law, the term has been used mainly in relation to fraud and other economic crimes.  The civil law of conspiracy is based on the principle that two or more people acting together can violate the criminal law. This is because conspiracies are not illegal by themselves; they are only illegal if they result in the commission of a criminal act. For this reason, civil conspiracies are often easier to prove than criminal conspiracies.  In most countries, a civil conspiracy is not a distinct criminal offence; it is simply another form of conspiracy (along with criminal and quasi-criminal conspiracies). However, there are a few countries (e.g. France and the United States) where civil conspiracy is itself a criminal offence. In these countries, anyone who conspires to commit any crime (including economic crimes such as fraud) is guilty of conspiracy offences irrespective of whether or not they commit any actual crimes as a result of their co-conspirator's actions.

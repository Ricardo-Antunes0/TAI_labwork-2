The Emergency in India was an 21-month period, starting on June 25, 1975 and ending on January 20, 1977, during which the nation was governed by a state of emergency. The Emergency was declared by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi after the Hindu-Muslim violence in the city of Ayodhya. In the months preceding the Emergency, opposition parties had accused Gandhi of failing to control the situation and of being too sympathetic to Muslims. The government used the emergency powers to suppress dissent, to ban political parties and to suspend individual liberties. It also made changes to the Constitution, reducing the power of parliament. The emergency was repealed in 1977 following a mass movement led by Indira Gandhi's son Sanjay Gandhi.

Park Avenue Tower (also 65 East 55th Street, 65 East 55th Street Building, or simply 65 East 55th) is a skyscraper located at the southeast corner of Park Avenue and East 55th Street in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Completed in 1930, it is the sixth-tallest building in the city and the eleventh-tallest in the United States. At 1,250 feet (381 m), it stands as the tallest building in New York outside of Manhattan.  The tower was originally designed by architects William Van Alen and Lewis Pilcher and built by the Equitable Life Assurance Society. It was originally designated as Equitable Building No. 3, but was later renamed Park Avenue Tower after the avenue on which it stands. The building served as headquarters for UBS until they relocated to the bank's new headquarters on Park Avenue in 2007. The tower is currently owned by Brookfield Properties and managed by SL Green Realty Corp.

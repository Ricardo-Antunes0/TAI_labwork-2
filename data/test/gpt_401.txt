Johann Erasmus Kindermann (29 March 1616 – 8 December 1684) was a German Lutheran theologian and philosopher. He is best known for his work on the Protestant Reformation, which earned him the title "The Prince of Preachers".  Born in Halle, Saxony, Kindermann studied theology at the University of Wittenberg and then at the University of Tübingen. He served as a pastor in Halle and Jena before moving to the University of Strasbourg in 1664 to become its rector. There he became one of the leading figures of the German Enlightenment. In 1677 he was called to the University of Heidelberg, where he served as rector until his death.  Kindermann's most important works include his commentary on the Bible (1670), his theological treatise "The Christian Religion" (1680), and his philosophical work "The Philosophy of Human Nature" (1684). He also published poems, plays, and novels.

Bossiaea foliosa, commonly known as leafy bossiaea, is a species of flowering plant in the palm family, Arecaceae. It is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, where it is found on the island of Kaua ªi.  This species is a medium-sized palm with a trunk up to 25 feet tall and a spread of up to 30 feet. The trunk is cylindrical with a smooth surface. The leaves are arranged in two ranks, the uppermost pair being larger and borne on long petioles. The leaflets are ovate to elliptical, with a raised midrib and a serrated margin. The flowers are white, borne in clusters at the tips of the branches. The fruit is a barrel-shaped pod containing one or two seeds.   Bossiaea foliosa is threatened by the destruction of its habitat by feral pigs and honeycreepers, as well as by competition from other plants.

The  (EPI) is a European processor initiative launched in 2007 to promote the development and use of high-performance processors. The initiative is led by the European Commission, with the support of member states.  The EPI has two goals: to increase the competitiveness of Europe's processor industry and to improve the performance and efficiency of European computing systems. To achieve these goals, the EPI promotes the development, deployment and use of high-performance processors across a range of applications. The initiative also supports research and development in this area, and promotes the sharing of best practices between member states.  The EPI is divided into four working groups: Core Processor Technology, Multiprocessor Technology, Embedded Processors, and System Level Integration. Each working group focuses on specific aspects of processor technology. For example, the Core Processor Technology group develops new architectural concepts for processors, while the Embedded Processors group designs systems-on-chip that integrate multiple processors.

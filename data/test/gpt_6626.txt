Eucalyptus carnea, known as the thick-leaved mahogany, is a eucalyptus tree that is endemic to Western Australia. It is a medium-sized, spreading tree that typically grows to around 25â€“30 m tall, with a trunk diameter of around 2 m. The bark is rough and scaly, and the leaves are ovate to lance-shaped, with a length of around 10 cm and a width of 3 cm. The flowers are white and fragrant, and are produced in racemes between May and November. The fruit is a small, dark brown pod that contains two to four dark brown seeds.   The thick-leaved mahogany is found in the Upper Swan Coastal Plain and the Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions of Western Australia. It prefers moist, shaded soils that are well-drained, and can be found growing in areas near swamps, rivers, or creeks. The tree is tolerant of maritime conditions, and can be found growing along coastlines or near the water's edge. The thick-leaved mahogany is used for timber production, and is also used for its wood pulp.

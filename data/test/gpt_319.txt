In a general sense, the design load refers to the amount of work that needs to be done in order to create a new design or to improve an existing design.  Generally, the design load can be broken down into two categories: conceptual and technical. Conceptual design loads are those that are related to the overall concept of the product or service. These loads might include developing a detailed outline or plan for the project, developing market research, and creating user specifications. Technical design loads, on the other hand, are those that are involved in creating the specific details of the product or service. These loads might involve designing the user interface, creating prototypes, and testing the design.  The amount of work that needs to be done in order to create a new design or to improve an existing design is often determined by two factors: the complexity of the task and the amount of time that is available. The more complex the task, the more time that is likely needed to complete it. Additionally, the more time that is available, the more iterations or versions of the product or service can be created before it is final. In general, it is important to keep in mind both of these factors when creating a design load estimate.

Eliminationist antisemitism is an extreme form of antisemitism which seeks to completely purge Jews and Judaism from society, either through genocide or through other means. Eliminationist antisemitism evolved from older concepts of religious antisemitism. The concept was developed by Daniel Goldhagen in his book Hitler's Willing Executioners to describe German antisemitism in the twentieth century, but has since been adapted and used to describe antisemitism in other societies and eras. Origin The concept was originally developed by Daniel Goldhagen in his book Hitler's Willing Executioners, in which he proposed that Germans harbored uniquely eliminationist antisemitism which led them to perpetrate the Holocaust.  Robert Wistrich is another historian who has written about the idea of eliminationist antisemitism with regards to Germany, although he does not believe the phenomenon is unique to Germany. Goldhagen's thesis is not accepted by most historians of Germany. For example, Helmut Walser Smith argues that "eliminationst antisemitism" was not common in Imperial Germany, but was found on the fringes of society voiced by such figures as Theodor Fritsch.

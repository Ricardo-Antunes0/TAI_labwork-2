Hettie Anderson (1873 – January 10, 1938) was an African-American art model and muse who posed for American sculptors and painters including Daniel Chester French, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, John La Farge, Anders Zorn, Bela Pratt, Adolph Alexander Weinman, and Evelyn Beatrice Longman. Among Anderson's high-profile likenesses are the winged Victory figure on the Sherman Memorial at Grand Army Plaza in Manhattan, New York City and $20 gold coins known as the Saint-Gaudens double eagle. Theodore Roosevelt deemed Victory "one of the finest figures of its kind." Saint-Gaudens described Anderson as "certainly the handsomest model I have ever seen of either sex" and considered her "Goddess-like." Biography  Anderson (sometimes listed in documents as Harriette, Harriet, and Hattie, and known to her family as Cousin Tootie) was born in 1873 in Columbia, South Carolina. Her family members were free African-Americans, listed in censuses and city directories as "colored" or "mulatto." Relatives owned real estate and worked as builders, painters, barbers, and seamstresses. Her uncle and aunt Andrew Madison Wallace and Martha Lee Wallace and their children (Andrew's parents were an Irish-born priest, James Wallace, and an enslaved woman named Mary or Sarah) had escaped to Canada during the American Civil War. During and after the Reconstruction era, family members became physicians, government workers, teachers, and civil rights activists. Her mother Caroline Lee, the daughter of a carpenter named Henry Lee and his wife Eliza, worked as a seamstress and was widowed young (her husband was named Joseph Scott, while Benjamin Dickerson is listed as Hettie's father). Caroline had two other children, Charles Dickerson (c. 1872–1936) and Sally (born c. 1867). The family lived on property they owned on Wayne Street near Taylor. By 1895, Hettie Anderson (it is not clear when she adopted that last name) was living in Manhattan. She trained and modeled at the Art Students League of New York and at times worked as a clerk and seamstress. She and Caroline (listed as "white" in censuses) rented an apartment at 698 Amsterdam Avenue on the Upper West Side.

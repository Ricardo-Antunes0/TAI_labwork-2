Han Dae-soo (Hangul: 한대수; born March 12, 1948) is a South Korean film director, screenwriter, and film producer. He is perhaps best known for directing the critically acclaimed films The Housemaid (1996), Memories of Murder (2003), and The Touch (2010), as well as the comedy-drama Winter Sonata (2008).  Han was born in Seoul, South Korea. After graduating from high school, he worked as an editor at a publishing company. In 1975, he founded his own film company and began making his directorial debut with the short film A Taxidermist's Wife. His subsequent films garnered critical acclaim, including the acclaimed The Housemaid which won him the Best Director Award at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. Han also won Best Screenplay Awards for both The Housemaid and Memories of Murder.  Han's later films have been met with mixed reactions from critics; while some have praised his visual style and ability to explore complex themes, others have derided them for being overly sentimental and melodramatic. However, Han's popularity has continued to grow in South Korea, where he is now regarded as one of the country's most important directors.

 Yates Mill is a fully restored, circa 1756 gristmill located five miles (8Â km) south of downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, United States. It is the centerpiece of Historic Yates Mill County Park, in central Wake County. The park features the restored mill; a visitor center with a museum focused on milling and on the natural history of the area, classrooms, an auditorium and space for research conducted by North Carolina State University faculty and students; a  lake; and extensive hiking trails. The park is managed as a native wildlife refuge with a mission to study and interpret the park's cultural, natural and agricultural heritage. History  Yates Mill, one of the oldest buildings in Wake County, is the region's only surviving operable gristmill. For nearly 200 years the water-powered mill produced lumber, milled corn and wheat, and carded wool. The land on which the mill is situated was surveyed for Samuel Pearson in October 1756, and granted to him by the Earl of Granville, one of the North Carolina colony's Lord Proprietors. The original mill was built around at that time. Pearson steadily increased his land holdings, and owned more than  at the time of his death in 1802. In 1819, accumulated debts forced Pearson's son, Simon, to sell the mill and its surrounding acreage at a sheriff's auction. William Boylan, a prominent Raleigh businessman and director of the State Bank, bought the property, and over the next 30 years modernized the mill several times, adding a sawmill in the 1840s.

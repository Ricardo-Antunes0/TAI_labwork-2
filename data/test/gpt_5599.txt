George Lawrence Mikan Jr. (; June 18, 1926 – May 14, 1984) was an American professional basketball player. He is considered one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, despite never winning an NBA championship. Mikan was a dominant player during his era and is the only player ever to rank in the top 10 in both scoring and rebounding in a single season.  Mikan was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, and attended John Burroughs High School. He played college basketball at DePaul University, where he was a two-time All-American and led the Blue Demons to the NCAA Championship game in his junior year. He was drafted by the Chicago Stags in the first round of the 1949 NBA draft and played for the Stags and the Minneapolis Lakers over eight seasons. After being traded to the Philadelphia Warriors in 1958, he became a key player on their team that won three consecutive NBA Championships (1960–62).  Mikan was diagnosed with leukemia in late May 1984, just two months after his 38th birthday. He died two months later at UCLA Medical Center at the age of 49.  George Mikan was born on June 18, 1926, in St. Louis, Missouri, to George Mikan Sr., a Croatian immigrant, and Helen (née Kraus). Mikan was one of six children: Frank (1915–2003), Donnie (1917–2005), Peggy (1921–2008), Kathy (1924–2011), George Jr

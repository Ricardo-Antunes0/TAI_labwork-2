Marika Aba (November 12, 1929 â€” November 12, 1972) was the professional name of a dancer and journalist born in Budapest, Hungary. Born Marika Wolff, her father was an engineer who disappeared while working in Turkey at the outbreak of World War II. After the war, during the Soviet occupation of Hungary, she and her mother, the remarried Georgina Maros, escaped to Austria by swimming across a river at night. Having trained as a ballerina in Austria, she was a prima ballerina in Rome when she landed the role of the Assyrian Dancer at Nero's banquet in the 1951 movie Quo Vadis, after which she moved her residence to Sherman Oaks, California. In 1952 she appeared as the flower girl in the MGM musical film Lovely to Look At. In 1961 she appeared as a contestant on the TV quiz show, You Bet Your Life, hosted by Groucho Marx. She was escorted on stage by Harpo Marx. After her brief film career she became a journalist, writing for the Los Angeles Times about the arts. She returned to Italy and focused her reporting on the Italian movie industry. Film critic Charles Champlin noted the "ebullience and wit" of her writing.

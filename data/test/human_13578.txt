Lieutenant John R. McNulty (1832 â€“ January 11, 1912) of Baltimore, Maryland  was the Confederacy (American Civil War) war hero, who with a single strategic shot of his 2nd Maryland Artillery command's (Baltimore Light Artillery) Confederate States of America (CSA) guns at the Battle of Old Town (U.S. Civil War 1864 Valley Campaign), while perilously close to Union Army (Federal) forces, saved Brig. Gen. (CSA) John McCausland's element of the Army of Northern Virginia from entrapment behind Union (American Civil War) lines on return route from raids into Maryland and Pennsylvania and their sacking and burning of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania in retaliation for the Union Army burning of the Virginia Military Institute and as part of the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Historical context Lt. Gen. (CSA) Jubal A. Early's (under whom McCausland served) Valley Campaigns of '64 were part of a strategy to save the Confederate breadbasket for the provision of the Army of Northern Virginia from the barn burners Maj. Gen. (USA) "Black Dave" David Hunter and, later, General (USA) Philip Sheridan and to menace Washington, D.C. as part of the larger strategy of Gen. (CSA) Robert E. Lee and Gen. (CSA) Joseph E. Johnston for the outnumbered and out-resourced Confederate States Army to break the Northern populations resolve for war and force the Union to peace parlay by bringing the horror of battle to Northern soil while bogging down advancing Union Army troops. This strategy was near successful but for Jefferson Davis' improvident decision to replace Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, who was prudent with his charge of his troops lives, with the reckless John Bell Hood. Abraham Lincoln himself did not believe that he had any chance of being reelected in the Presidential election of 1864 on his pro war ticket against opponent reconciliation or "truce" and "peace candidate" relieved General of the Army (United States) George B. McClellan, until the last moments when Major general (USA) William Tecumseh Sherman, taking advantage of Hood's earlier precipitous troop movements, to Northern public adulation breached the western Confederate defensive line at the Battle of Atlanta.

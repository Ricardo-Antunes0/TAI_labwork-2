Matuschka, birth name Joanne Motichka (born March 19, 1954) is a New York City photographer, artist, author, activist, and model. Her self-portrait on the Sunday cover of New York Times magazine in 1993 was chosen by LIFE for a special edition entitled 100 Photographs that Changed the World published in 2003 and again in 2011. The artist has been nominated for many awards, including a Pulitzer Prize, and has received dozens of citations, honors, and distinctions for her photographic works and activism since the early 90s. In 2012 Matuschka appeared in Rose Hartman's book Incomparable Women of Style, and in 2011 John Loengard included her in his monograph: The Age of Silver: Encounters with Great Photographers. Early life: 1954–1970   Matuschka was born in Newton, New Jersey, where she and her older sibling survived physical abuse by their father, a policeman at the George Washington Bridge. As a child she constantly drew, and by 9 was making homemade greeting cards and selling them door-to-door.  Her first job at 12, was boxing danishes in a bakery where she earned 50 cents an hour.   When her mother, a farm hand from Allamuchy, New Jersey, died of breast cancer in 1968, Matuschka ran away from home, changed her name to “Lisa Cross” and began working as a cocktail waitress in Far Rockaway, New York.  Her father put a warrant out for her arrest but his 14-year-old daughter was never found. A year later “Lisa Cross” returned to New Jersey, became a ward of the State of New Jersey and was placed in Bergen County Juvenile Detention Center in Paramus, New Jersey. Shortly thereafter, she was transferred into foster care.

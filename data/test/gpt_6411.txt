In antiquity, publicans (Greek τελώνης telōnēs (singular); Latin publicanus) were dealers in wine and other alcoholic beverages, typically situated in public places such as the forums. With the advent of the printing press and the wider distribution of printed matter, their trade began to decline and they were superseded by tavern keepers.  Today a publican is most commonly a person who owns or manages a pub or bar. The term is also used metaphorically to describe someone who is open and willing to help others, especially in times of need.

WaHu Student Apartments (also known simply as WaHu or Wahu) is a luxury residential apartment building located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It was first announced in 2012 with intent to cater to the campus population of the nearby University of Minnesota. The complex comprises 327 residential units within three apartment towers. It also contains designated retail space, currently leased by tenants such as Bank of America, Blaze Pizza, and local restaurants. Its name is a combination of the two roads at its adjacent intersection, Huron Boulevard Southeast and Washington Avenue Southeast. WaHu Student Apartments is located in the Stadium Village neighborhood of Minneapolis, built atop the site of a former blood plasma clinic that contributed to several construction delays for the complex. Neighboring structures to the apartment complex include TCF Bank Stadium and the Stadium Village light rail station. Construction of WaHu Student Apartments was completed in August 2015, in time for the start of the academic year.

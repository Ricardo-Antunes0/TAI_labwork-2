Elfquest (or ElfQuest) is a comic book series written and illustrated by Canadian artist Wendy Pini. It was originally published by Dark Horse Comics from 1978 to 1984, and has been reprinted many times since.  Elfquest tells the story of a world of elves, dwarves, dragons, and other creatures who live in harmony with nature. The series is set in the fictional land of Questria, which is ruled by a Queen and her court of elves. The central characters are the young elf warriors known as the "Questors", who travel throughout Questria seeking adventure and knowledge.  Wendy Pini's iconic art style has influenced a generation of comics artists and has helped make Elfquest one of the most popular comic book series ever created. The series has been adapted for television twice, first as a animated series produced by DiC Entertainment that aired on television from 1997 to 2000, and then as a live-action series produced by DreamWorks Animation that aired on television from 2013 to 2017.

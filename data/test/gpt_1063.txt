Paradise Inn is a historic hotel built in 1907 in the town of Paradise, about seven miles north of Ellensburg in central Washington. The hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.  The origins of the Paradise Inn can be traced back to 1881, when the first post office was established in what is now known as Paradise. The town grew slowly and did not become a significant center until 1906, when the railroad came through and brought tourists to the area. That year, the Paradise Inn was built by a group of businessmen as a way to capitalize on this new tourism industry.  The Paradise Inn is a two-story wood frame structure with a hip roof and clapboard siding. The exterior features a variety of decorative elements, including brackets supporting a pedimented gable, jigsaw work on the porch rooflines, and an octagonal tower at the corner of the building. The interior features many features typical of late 19th century hotels, including a grand lobby with marble flooring, high ceilings, and intricate woodwork.

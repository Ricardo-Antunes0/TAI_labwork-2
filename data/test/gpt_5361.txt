LifeLight Festival was an annual free outdoor music festival in Queenstown, New Zealand. The festival was first held in 2001 as a small gathering of friends and families, and quickly became one of the most popular events in the town.  The festival has seen many changes over the years, but has always remained true to its roots: a celebration of music and community. In 2017, LifeLight returned for its 20th anniversary and welcomed more than 30,000 people to enjoy some of the best regional and international music acts in one unforgettable weekend.

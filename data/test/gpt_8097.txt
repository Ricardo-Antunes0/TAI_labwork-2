Esther Popel (July 16, 1896 â€“ January 10, 1984) was an American mathematician and academic who specialized in analysis and the calculus of variations. She was the first woman to receive a mathematics Ph.D. from Yale University.  Born in 1896 in New York City, Esther Popel attended the Ethical Culture School and graduated from Barnard College in 1916. She then attended Yale University, where she received her Ph.D. in mathematics in 1927. After teaching at Bryn Mawr College for a year, she became a professor at the University of Michigan in 1929. She remained there until her retirement in 1973.  Popel's work in analysis and the calculus of variations is highly regarded, and she has been called "one of the most important mathematicians of the 20th century." Her books include Analysis (1937), Calculus of Variations (1939), and An Introduction to Analysis (1951).

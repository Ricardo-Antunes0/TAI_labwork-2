Gale J. Young (1912â€“1990) was an American theoretical physicist and one of the founders of the field of quantum field theory. He was a fellow of both the American Physical Society and the Institute of Physics.  Born in 1912 in Omaha, Nebraska, Gale J. Young received his B.S. from the University of Nebraska in 1934 and his M.S. from Harvard University in 1935. He then did post-doctoral work at the University of California, Berkeley, before joining the faculty at Princeton University in 1938.  In 1950, Young was appointed professor at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he remained until his retirement in 1973. He died in 1990.  Young was a significant figure in the development of quantum field theory and is considered one of its founders. His work on spontaneous symmetry breaking and quark confinement led to a deeper understanding of particle behavior and has had a significant impact on modern physics.

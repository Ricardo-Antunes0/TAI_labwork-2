The PCC (Presidents' Conference Committee) is a streetcar standard in the United States and Canada. It was jointly developed in the 1930s by the American Public Transit Association and the Canadian National Railways. The PCC was a significant improvement over earlier streetcar standards, and it remains in widespread use today.  PCC streetcars are popular in North America for their smooth ride, versatility, and longevity. They are typically found in larger cities with robust transit systems, and they are often chosen over other streetcar types for their ability to operate on mixed traffic environments.  Today, PCC streetcars are being replaced in many cities by new streetcar models. However, they remain popular with riders, and they are often used as historical artifacts in museums.

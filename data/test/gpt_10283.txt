Politics of Suriname take place in a constitutional monarchy with a unicameral parliament. Executive power is exercised by the monarch, who appoints the prime minister, who in turn appoints other ministers. The judiciary is independent. Suriname is a member of the Caribbean Community and the Organization of American States.  The population of Suriname is about 514,000 (2012 est.). The majority of the population is of African descent, although there are also Indian, Chinese, Dutch, and Portuguese residents. The official languages are English and French, although Portuguese is also spoken by a minority. Christianity is the predominant religion, although there are also Muslims and Hindus.  Suriname has a history of colonialism and resistance to it. After gaining independence from Netherlands in 1975, the country experienced several years of instability and military rule before elections were held in 1980. Since then, Suriname has had a series of political parties and coalitions that have alternated in power. In 2008, Suriname's first female Prime Minister was appointed.

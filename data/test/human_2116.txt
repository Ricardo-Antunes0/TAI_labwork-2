Deer Medicine Rocks (Siouan: literal translation "Antler Rocks") is a sandstone formation located on the west bank of Rosebud Creek in the vicinity of Lame Deer, Montana, United States.  The formation is significant for its association with the Great Sioux War of 1876-77, and its connection with Sitting Bull's visionary sun dance of early June 1876 which prophesied victory at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.  At its nomination to National Historic Landmark status in 2011, it was described as the only site to offer "a wholly Native American historical interpretation of the Battle of the Little Big Horn." Description The Deer Medicine Rocks are located on the west bank of Rosebud Creek.  They are formed out of a sandstone promontory originally part of the hills that rise west of the creek, with erosive forces removing the intervening material.  The formation rises about  above the surrounding terrain.  The surfaces at its base have numerous rock art panels.  Expert opinion is divided on the ages of much of this artwork, with age ranges proposed from 1000 to 4000 years ago.  Some of the artwork is clearly post-contact origin, depicting cowboys, horses, and guns.  The panels depict themes and images common to other rock art sites found throughout the region.

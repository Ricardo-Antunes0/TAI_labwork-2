Sefton Coast is a 4605.3 hectare (11379.9 acre) Site of special scientific interest which stretches for 12 miles (20Â km)  between Southport and Waterloo, which is end location of Crosby Beach. The site was notified in 2000 for both its biological and geological features.  The coast has species such as grass of Parnassus, wild orchids, rare butterflies, sand lizards, natterjack toads and waders.   Sefton Coast includes Crosby beach which is also the site of an art installation by Antony Gormley, called Another Place. Further north is the National Trust site of Formby Point containing pinewoods and sand dunes. The whole of the coastline here is managed as a Special Area of Conservation(SAC) for its important wildlife reserves by Sefton Coast Partnership. The pine woods at Victoria Road have been established as a National Trust reserve for the red squirrel, listed on the endangered species list. Formby is one of several sites in Britain where the red squirrel can still be found although it is now being threatened by the grey squirrel.

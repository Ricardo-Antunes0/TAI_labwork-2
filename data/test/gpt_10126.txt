The Uzushio-class submarine (Whirlpools) was a series of three submarines of the Japanese Navy, the first of which was completed in 1967.  The boats were designed to operate submerged for extended periods, primarily in the littoral zone around Japan's coasts. They were also equipped with sonar and weaponry to defend Japanese territory.  The submarines were decommissioned in the early 1990s and disposed of through the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force's scrapping program.

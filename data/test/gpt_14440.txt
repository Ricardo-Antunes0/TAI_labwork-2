Quintus Fabius Pictor (born BC, BC) was a Roman painter who worked during the first century BC. He was born in Rome, and although little is known about his life, it is assumed that he received his training from the best painters of his day.  Pictor's early works reflect the influence of the great masters of the times, such as Marcellus and Praxiteles. However, it was not until he worked in Apulia that he began to develop his own unique style. His landscapes are characterized by their realism and use of light and shade to create a sense of depth.  Pictor is best known for his paintings of Roman scenes, including battles, processions, and hunting scenes. He also produced a number of portraits, including one of Cicero. His work has been lost but has been reassembled and studied by later artists, who have been able to reconstruct a good portion of his oeuvre.

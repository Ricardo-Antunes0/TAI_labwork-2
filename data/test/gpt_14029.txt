John Gavan Duffy (15 October 1844 – 18 October 1917) was an Irish novelist, short story writer and playwright. He is best known for his novels The Well of Loneliness (1915), The Informer (1915), and The Tower (1928), and for his short stories, many of which have been anthologized.  Duffy was born in Dublin, one of the six children of John Duffy, a doctor, and his wife Catherine (née Morrin). After graduating from Trinity College, Dublin in 1868 with honours in mathematics and classics, he began studying law but abandoned it after two years to devote himself full-time to writing. He lived most of his life in Dublin but spent time in London, Paris and Rome. In 1903 he returned permanently to Dublin, where he died eighteen years later.

Common names: inland carpet python, Murray Darling carpet python, MD carpet python, Victorian carpet python. Morelia spilota metcalfei is a python subspecies found in Australia, commonly known as the Murray Darling carpet python. The pythons are non-venomous snakes that constrict their prey. They grow up to 2.7m (9 feet), but adults are usually around 2.4m (8 feet). Color varies depending on locality; Victorian MD's are silver with solid black blotches and stripes, as we move into NSW the silver becomes a light brown and the patterning becomes more of a dark brown rather than black, the SA MD's introduce patches of maroon. These pythons are semi-arboreal, typically inhabiting rocky outcrops, dry woodlands, riverine forests and flood plains. The threats to the snakes are people and other snakes. Diet Murray Darling pythons naturally feed on mammals, birds and lizards. In captivity, they are fed mice and rats, and as adults can be fed rabbits, quails and small chickens.

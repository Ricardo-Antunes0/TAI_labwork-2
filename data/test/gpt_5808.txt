ANNE is a 2014 play dramatising the life of the titular Anne, the second wife of King George II. The play is written by Jez Butterworth and directed by Mike Newell. The cast includes Emma Thompson, Helena Bonham Carter and Ralph Fiennes.  Anne (Thompson) is a clever and beautiful woman who is imprisoned by her scheming and jealous first wife, Catherine (Carter), in her own home. Catherine has ambitions to rule England jointly with her son, but Anne has her own ideas about how England should be run. When the King remarries, Anne finds herself at the centre of a power struggle between her new queen and Catherine, who tries to undermine her at every turn.

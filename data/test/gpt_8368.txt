Kushwaha (sometimes, Kushvaha) is a community of pastoralists in the Kathiawar-Gir-Vindhyan region of western India. They are a nomadic people who follow a traditional way of life that relies heavily on cattle herding and agriculture.  The kushwaha are believed to have originated in the state of Gujarat, although they are now found throughout the Kathiawar-Gir-Vindhyan region and beyond. Their traditional occupation is herding camels, goats, and sheep, but they also engage in agriculture, especially peanuts and tobacco. They are an intensely patriarchal community, with authority resting with the male elders.  The kushwaha are an endogamous community, with marriage between members of the same tribe generally prohibited. The kushwaha religion revolves around a pantheon of gods and goddesses, many of whom are associated with specific aspects of life such as fertility, agriculture, and water. They also believe in a form of soul transmigration that allows the dead to continue living on earth through intermediaries known as yakshis.

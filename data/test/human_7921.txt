Machines Dream are a Canadian progressive rock band from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. The group are defined by their accessible progressive rock sound, and recognition through the Internet. The band has functioned internationally despite geographic distance from their audience and – in 2016 – signed to Progressive Gears Records – a subsidiary of Progressive Gears Management – in Northern Ireland. Machines Dream was founded in 2008 and the current line-up consists of Craig West (Bass/Vocals), Brian Holmes (Keyboards), Phil Greco (Drums), Rob Coleman (Guitar), Keith Conway (Guitar), and Jake Rendell (Acoustic Guitar/Vocals/Percussion).  Machines Dream released their self-titled debut in 2012, followed in 2014 with the sophomore album Immunity and digital EP 100 Afternoons. Their third album, Black Science, was released in 2016 to relative widespread praise from European radio stations and internet radio prog fans. A follow up to Black Science was Machines Dream's live off the floor recording at Revelle Studio's in their hometown. Following a hiatus after the release of Black Science, the band announced a new album would be released in early 2022. Origins  Machines Dream were formed in 2008 when Craig West (lead vocals, bass guitar), Brian Holmes (keyboards), Ken Coulter (drums), and Shayne Wigglesworth (guitar) began jamming regularly following a one-off performance to fulfil a contractual obligation of West's. In 2009, the group added Marco Pierucci on bass guitar, allowing West to play second guitar, and recorded demos that would be the basis of their first album. In 2010 Pierucci left the band so prompting West to return to the role of bassist/vocalist.

She founded the nonprofit intercultural association Joliba in Germany and is perhaps best known for co-editing the book Farbe bekennen with May Ayim (then May Opitz) and Dagmar Schultz. The English translation of this book was entitled Showing Our Colors: Afro-German Women Speak Out. Oguntoye has played an important role in the Afro-German Movement. Life Katharina Oguntoye grew up in Leipzig, Heidelberg and in Nigeria. According to statements from Oguntoye her mother met her father at the University of Leipzig, where he was studying with the help of a scholarship from the German Democratic Republic. Oguntoye’s father returned to Nigeria in 1965 to take up a professorship. Her mother joined him a year later with Oguntoye and her younger brother and they lived on the university campus. Oguntoye got to know her father’s side of the family there. Two years later, in 1967, the Biafran War broke out so Oguntoye returned with her mother to her aunt’s hometown of Heidelberg in Germany. Oguntoye’s brother stayed with their father.

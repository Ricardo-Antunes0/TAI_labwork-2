Lira is the name of several currency units and coins used in different parts of the world. The first lira was introduced in 1876, when the Ottoman Empire was divided into a number of new countries. The name is derived from the Latin word for 'pound'.   The modern Turkish lira is divided into 100 kuru≈ü.

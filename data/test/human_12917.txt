Bora Spužić Kvaka (Serbian Cyrillic: Бора Спужић Квака; 10 November 1934 – 9 March 2002) was a Serbian vocalist and recording artist with a career spanning almost three decades. Biography Spužić was born as Velibor Spužić on 10 November 1934 in the western Kosovo town of Orahovac, at the time part of the Vardar Banovina in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia to father Todor and mother Olga. He was the fifth of six children in the family. In 1941, the Spužić family had to emigrate from Kosovo, deciding on Ćićevac. While living in Ćićevac at the very end of the war in 1945, he fell from a tree during a playground game and dislocated his hip. As a result, his left leg remained twenty-five centimetres shorter than his right leg. Due to that fracture, he had to wear a cast for eleven months after which he had to spend a lot of time in the Sremska Kamenica hospital and his education was late by a few years. From Ćićevac, the family moved to Zemun and shortly after to Požarevac where his father gained employment as a clerk in the Tax Administration. Spužić began singing and playing the accordion in Požarevac using his neighbour's accordion.

The Bahmani family, also Bahmani-Qajar is an Iranian royal family. The Bahmani dynasty was founded by Mirza Abol Hassan, a Persianized member of the Qajar dynasty, who proclaimed himself Shah of Iran in 1747.  The dynasty reached its peak under the rule of Mohammad Shah Bahmani, who reigned from 1748 to 1796. Mohammad Shah Bahmani was the most powerful Iranian monarch of his time and is credited with leading the country through its final period of political stability and economic development. His son and successor, Abbas II, continued these policies and expanded the royal domains into present-day Azerbaijan and Armenia. The dynasty ended with the collapse of the Qajar dynasty in 1925, and the Bahmanis were banned from ever again holding any power in Iran.  The family consists of several branches: The Qajars, who were originally from Fars; The Hashemites, who are descended from the Prophet Muhammad's grandsons Ali and Hussein; The Zandis, who are a Shia Muslim minority group from southern Iran; and The Bahmanis, who are a Sunni Muslim dynasty from Iran.

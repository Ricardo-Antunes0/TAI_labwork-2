The Dark class, or Admiralty "Type A", patrol boat was a class of patrol boat built for the Royal Navy during the Second World War. They were preceded by the Type A1 patrol boat and were succeeded by the Type A3 patrol boat.  The Dark class was designed as a replacement for the aging P-class boats that had served in the First World War. They were faster and more heavily armed than their predecessors, and were tasked with patrolling British waters, as well as providing escort duties for convoys. The majority of the Dark class was built at shipyards located on the east coast of England, with a total of eighty-eight vessels being constructed.  The Dark class saw action during the Battle of the Atlantic, where they played a key role in protecting British shipping from German submarines. They also saw action during the Normandy landings, where they provided escort duties for Allied troops as they advanced inland. The Dark class was eventually replaced by the Type A3 patrol boat, which was fitted with more modern weapons and capabilities.

William Henry Valpy (2 January 1793 – 25 September 1852)  was a noted early settler of Dunedin, New Zealand. He is sometimes referred to locally as "The father of Saint Clair", as he was the first settler in the area now occupied by the suburb of Saint Clair. Valpy was born in Reading, Berkshire, the son of English educationalist Richard Valpy and the younger brother of the English printer and publisher Abraham John Valpy. Valpy spent much of his early life in Calcutta, where he worked as a judge. He retired to England in 1836, but poor health prompted him to emigrate with his family to healthier climes. They arrived in the new settlement of Otago only one year after its founding, in January 1849. William, with his wife Caroline (born 1804; née Jeffreys) travelled with five of their six children: artist Ellen Penelope Valpy Jeffreys, Catherine Henrietta Elliot Valpy Fulton (who became a suffragist), Arabella Valpy (who was instrumental in bringing the Salvation Army to New Zealand), Juliet Valpy, and William. Their sixth child, Caroline, remained in England with her husband.

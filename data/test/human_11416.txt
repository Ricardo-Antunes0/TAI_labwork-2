Painless  is a 2012 fantasy horror film and the feature film directorial debut of Juan Carlos Medina. The film is a joint production between Spain, France, and Portugal and had its world premiere on 8 September 2012 at the Toronto International Film Festival. Painless is set in Catalonia and follows two different story lines, one set during the Spanish Civil War and one set in the modern day. Synopsis The film's premise is partially set in 1931 during the Spanish Civil War, where a group of children are brought to a monastery turned hospital for medical testing. None of the children are capable of feeling physical pain, something that Dr. Holzmann (Derek de Lint) hopes to remedy with his procedures. However at the same time his colleague Dr. Carcedo (Ramon Fontser√®) believes that the children would be better off locked up in his asylum in Canfranc. One young patient named Benigno (played at different ages by Ilias and Mot Stothart) stands out in particular, as he proves to be exceptionally intelligent but also easily prone to violent outbursts - something that Carcedo believes is further proof of his beliefs. Holzmann's plans are ultimately never brought to fruition, as the hospital is besieged and taken over by several different military forces.

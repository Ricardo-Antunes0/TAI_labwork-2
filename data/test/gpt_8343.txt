They are believed to have migrated from the lower Great Lakes region about 2,000 years ago.  The Gwichʼin are a people whose traditional economy is based on hunting and trapping. They are also skilled carvers and artists, and their baskets, mats, and clothing are highly prized by collectors. The Gwichʼin have close ties with the neighbouring Inuit communities, and they share a number of cultural practices.

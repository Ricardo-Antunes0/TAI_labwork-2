The X-Mansion or Xavier Institute is the school for young mutants located in Westchester County, New York. It was founded by Professor Charles Xavier and is the personal headquarters of the X-Men.  The X-Mansion was constructed in the late 1960s on a remote stretch of rural property in Westchester County, New York. Originally, the school consisted of a single building housing both the Institute and the students' dormitories. Over time, the Institute has expanded to include additional buildings and facilities, including a training area, a library, and a medical center. The X-Mansion also contains an airport hangar, which has been used to transport X-Men members and allies around the world.  In recent years, the X-Mansion has come under attack on multiple occasions. In March 2004, the school was attacked by a team of mutants known as Freedom Force; in May 2014, it was attacked by Iceman and his team of villains, The Hellfire Club; and in November 2014, it was briefly taken over by Apocalypse.  The X-Mansion has long been home to many famous mutants, including Beast, Cyclops, Colossus, Gambit, Rogue, Storm, Wolverine and Jean Grey. In recent years, new students have begun to enroll at the X-Mansion, including Nightcrawler, Blink and Psylocke.

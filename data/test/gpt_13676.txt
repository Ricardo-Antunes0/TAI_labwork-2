In olive oil extraction, malaxation (Latin malaxare, "to mash") is the process of breaking down the cell walls of the olives with a solvent, such as hexane, to extract their oil.  Malaxation is an important step in olive oil extraction, as it allows for the extraction of both the monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated oils. The most common solvents used for malaxation are hexane and ethyl acetate.

The earned gold can be spent on stratagems, which are special boosts represented by the officers of a player's faction. They come with different bonuses: increasing attack and defense, boosting the aggression of the enemy's army, making the bases easier to seize, and others. The army can be equipped with items and weapons that are found on the battlefield, like buffs, enhancements or horses.

Michael Chen (c. 1950â€“March 13, 1983) was a Chinese-born American gangster who was leader of the Flying Dragons gang from the late 1970s and early 1980s. Early life Michael Chen,   was born in the Canton region of China in 1950, and the family re-located to British Hong Kong shortly thereafter. During this period, tensions existed in Hong Kong between a corrupt police force, Chinese communist agitators, and the Hong Kong colonial government. This, along with other socio-economic pressures drove Chen's father to emigrate to the United States after Chen was conceived, but before he was born. In 1963, when he was 13 years old, Chen, his mother and his sister left Hong Kong to re-unite with Chen senior in New York City. Chen worked as a delivery boy for a Chinese restaurant in Upper Manhattan while attending Seward Park High School near Chinatown. His father was a taxi driver. He graduated from high school in 1968, and briefly attended college.

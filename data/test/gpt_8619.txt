Sven Audun Nordin (born 6 February 1957) is a Norwegian professor of mathematical sciences at the University of Oslo.  Nordin was born in Oslo, a son of Professor Audun Nordin and Laila Bjørnsen. He graduated from the University of Oslo with the degree of mag. Sci. in 1983, and obtained his dr.philos. degree in 1989.  In 1984 he was appointed associate professor at the University of Oslo, and in 1991 he was promoted to professor. He served as president of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 2002 to 2006, and as rector of the University of Oslo from 2006 to 2010. Nordin has been a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters since 1994.  Nordin's research focuses on algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and mathematical physics. He is known for his work on symplectic geometry, birational invariance theory, Chern–Simons theory, and nilpotent Lie groups.   Nordin has written several books, including "Algebraic Geometry" (with Rolf Nevanlinna), "Differential Geometry" (with Jürgen Haag), "Geometry" (with Vladimir Voevodsky), "Introduction to symplectic geometry" (with Michael Atiyah), "Birational invariance theory" (with Sergey Vlasov), "Chern–Simons theory" (with Alexander Grothendieck), and "Nilpotent Lie groups

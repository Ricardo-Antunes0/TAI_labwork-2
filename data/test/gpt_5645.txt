TUTOR, also known as PLATO Author Language, is a computer program that was created in the early 1980s to help students learn how to use a computer. TUTOR is designed to be used as a supplement to other teaching methods, and can be used in a variety of settings, such as schools, universities, and businesses.  TUTOR was originally developed by the United States Navy in order to improve the literacy skills of sailors. The program has been adopted by many other organizations, including the United Kingdom's Open University, the Australian National University, and the State University of New York at Buffalo. TUTOR is also used by many individual users, who have found it to be an effective tool for learning how to use a computer.

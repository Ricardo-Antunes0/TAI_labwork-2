Puttershoek is a town and former municipality in the province of North-West, South Africa. It was renamed to Bushbuckridge in 1994. The town is located about 180 km north-west of the provincial capital, Bloemfontein.  Puttershoek was founded in 1872 by Pieter and Gerrit Jansen, who named it after the village of Puttershoek, Netherlands. The town was originally a farming and cattle-ranching community. In 1886, a railway line was built connecting Puttershoek with the Transvaal goldfields. This led to an influx of miners and traders, and the town quickly grew into a thriving commercial centre.  During the Second World War, Puttershoek was occupied by the German Forces from October 1942 to May 1945. The town was liberated by the Allied Forces on 5 May 1945. After the war, Puttershoek experienced a period of economic decline as it lost its key role as a commercial centre. However, in recent years there has been a revival in the town's economy, with new businesses opening and old ones expanding.   Today, Puttershoek is a thriving community with a population of about 10 000 people. It is home to several businesses and institutions, including a hospital, schools, and a library. The town also has a variety of recreational facilities, including an outdoor pool and a golf course.

In film studies, historical poetics is a term used to describe a critical approach that privileges the formal elements of film over its thematic or ideological content. It is also used to describe a film theory that pays close attention to how a particular film style informs or reflects the historical moment in which it was made.  Historical poetics has been largely associated with the work of Marxist film theorists such as Kristin Thompson and Andrew Sarris, who have argued that filmmakers use specific formal elements (e.g. plot, character, setting) to reflect and communicate socio-political messages. However, the approach has also been used by feminist and post-colonial film theorists, who argue that films reflect the ways in which various social groups are marginalized within wider society.   The aim of historical poetics is not simply to analyse films critically, but also to understand how they can be used as tools for social change. This means that historical poetics is not simply a method of analysis, but also a form of activism.

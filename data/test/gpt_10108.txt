Performance poetry is a broad term, encompassing a wide range of poetic forms, from spoken word and monologue to song and dance. It is often connected with improvisation and spontaneity, and is used to explore personal or political themes.  Performance poetry can be seen as a form of communication that is both immediate and interactive. It can be used to create community and to share ideas and experiences. It can be used to express emotions and explore relationships. It can be used to challenge conventional wisdom or to create new perspectives on the world.  Performance poetry has a long history, dating back to ancient Greece and Rome. The performance art movement of the 1960s and 1970s popularized performance poetry, and today it is widely considered an important part of the literary canon.

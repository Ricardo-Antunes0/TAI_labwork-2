Giorgio Belloni (Codogno (Lodi), 1861 – Azzano San Martino (Lombardy), 1947) was an Italian painter, mainly of landscapes.  Born in Codogno, Belloni trained at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Milan under the guidance of Felice Casorati and then traveled to Rome, where he met the French painter Auguste Renoir. Belloni exhibited his works in Paris and several other European cities before moving to Milan in 1912. There, he joined the group of artists known as the "Ten Italian Painters", which included Emilio Greco, Gino Severini, and Carlo Carrà. In 1922, he co-founded the magazine "L'Arte" with fellow artists Tommaso Paglia and Achille Perilli.  Belloni's landscapes are characterized by their use of light and color to create a sense of depth. He is best known for his paintings of Lombardy, especially Azzano San Martino and its surroundings.

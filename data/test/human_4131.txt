Gail Joanne Koff (May 15, 1945 â€“ August 31, 2010) was an American lawyer who became one of the lead partners in the law firm of Jacoby & Meyers, for which she helped establish a New York City office and develop a presence in the Northeastern United States. Koff was born in Manhattan on May 15, 1945, and was raised in Scarsdale, New York as a self-described "child of the 60s". She earned her B.A. degree in 1966 from the University of California, Berkeley. She earned her J.D. degree in 1969 from George Washington University Law School and worked for the Office of Economic Opportunity in the Legal Services Administration while she was still in school. She recounted being harassed as one of the law school's few female students, including an incident in which a professor told the class "'Miss Koff, would you please stand up so we can all see the dimensions of this case?" She was hired by the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom after graduating from law school.

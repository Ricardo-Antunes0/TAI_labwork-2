Israel Hess (April 26, 1935 â€“ September 16, 1998) was an American mathematician who made important contributions to the theory of nilpotent Lie groups and to the theory of automorphic forms.  Israel Hess was born in Brooklyn, New York, on April 26, 1935. He obtained his bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College in 1956 and his doctorate from Princeton University in 1962. From 1962 to 1965 he was a research associate at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. From 1965 to 1974 he was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where he also served as chairman of the mathematics department from 1971 to 1974. He then became a professor at the University of Notre Dame until his death in 1998.  Hess's research focused on the theory of nilpotent Lie groups and on the theory of automorphic forms. His work on nilpotent Lie groups has led to new insights into the structure of these groups and their dynamics. His work on automorphic forms has led to new insights into the structure and dynamics of curves and surfaces. Hess was also a pioneer in using computers to aid in his research.

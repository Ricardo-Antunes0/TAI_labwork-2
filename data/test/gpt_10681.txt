The Banda della Magliana (, Magliana Gang) was a Mafia-type organisation active in Rome, Italy, during the early to mid-20th century. The gang was founded in the early 1920s by Giuseppe Magliano and other Sicilian immigrants.  The gang was involved in a wide range of criminal activities, including extortion, loan sharking, prostitution, and drug trafficking. Its members were also known for their violence and brutality, and they were responsible for a number of high-profile murders. The gang was eventually dismantled by the Italian police in the late 1960s.

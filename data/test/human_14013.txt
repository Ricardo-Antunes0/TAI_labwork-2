Bristol Robotham Lord (September 21, 1883 â€“ November 13, 1964) was an American professional baseball outfielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1905 to 1913 for the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Naps, and Boston Braves. Lord is best known for a 1910 trade between Philadelphia and Cleveland in which he was exchanged for Morrie Rath and Shoeless Joe Jackson, who became one of the best hitters in baseball history. Career Lord made his major league debut in 1905 with the Athletics, and he appeared in 66 games that season. He became known as "The Human Eyeball" because he was said to have great eyesight. However, in his first three seasons, Lord hit .239, .233, and .182. Because of this lack of progress, Athletics owner/manager Connie Mack sent Lord to the New Orleans minor league team for the 1908 season. After Lord hit .314 for New Orleans, the Cleveland Naps purchased his contract in 1909, and Lord hit .269 in 69 games for Cleveland that year.

Speedy Boarding (foaled 10 February 2012) is a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. After finishing third on her only appearance as a juvenile in 2014 she won the Ballymacoll Stud Stakes in the following spring but was beaten in her other five starts and appeared to be a few pounds below the best fillies of her generation. She finally emerged as a top class racemare in 2016 when she recorded three major victories in France, taking the Prix Corrida, Prix Jean Romanet and Prix de l'Op√©ra. She was retired to become a broodmare at the end of the year. Background Speedy Boarding is a dark bay mare with a large white star and a white sock on her left hind leg bred by the Hampshire-based Meon Valley Stud. In October 2013 the yearling filly was put up for auction at Tattersalls but after failing to reach her reserve price of 95,000 guineas and was retained by her breeder. Like all of the stud's home bred horses she raced in the colours of Helena Springfield Ltd, which are black with white spots and a white cap. She was sent into training with James Fanshawe at Pegasus Stables in Newmarket and was ridden in all of her races by Freddy Tylicki.

Brooklyn Heights is a residential neighborhood within the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The neighborhood is bounded by Atlantic Avenue to the north, Flatbush Avenue to the east, Fourth Avenue to the south, and the Brooklyn Bridge to the west.  The area that is now Brooklyn Heights was first settled in 1636 as part of Dutch New York, and became a center of trade and commerce in the 18th century. In 1825, the land that is now Brooklyn Heights was purchased by merchant James Brown. Brown's intent was to build a grandiose estate on his new land, but he died before anything could be done. In 1838, his widow, Mary Brown Skinner Brown, began selling parcels of land in Brooklyn Heights to wealthy families. The neighborhood soon became known for its upscale homes and became a popular place for socialites and businessmen to live. In 1870, the Brooklyn Heights Promenade was constructed along Atlantic Avenue, which helped to increase tourism in the area.  In 1896, Brooklyn Heights was annexed by the City of Brooklyn. The neighborhood remained predominantly residential until the 1930s, when it began to become popular among young professionals and artists. Today, Brooklyn Heights remains a popular neighborhood for residents and tourists alike.

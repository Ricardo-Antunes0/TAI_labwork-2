Kristjan Kitsing (born December 11, 1990) is an Estonian professional basketball player for Kalev/Cramo of VTB United League. Kitsing is also a member of the Estonia national basketball team. Club career Kitsing started his career with the junior team of TÃœ/Rock. In the beginning of the 2008/2009 season, Kitsing was promoted to the senior team. In his first season he averaged 4 points a game with an average of almost 8 minutes in only 11 games. The following season looked a lot better for the Estonian youngster as he averaged 8,7 points in 16 minutes in the regular season, but was later benched for the playoffs although he proved to be one of the best prospects in Estonia at that time. After winning his first Estonia League title in Tartu, Kitsing moved to Kalev/Cramo in hopes of getting more playing time and gaining some experience in the VTB United League. With the new team and a new coach, his decision to change the club proved to be right as Kitsing averaged 6,5 points in 16 minutes, playing in a total of 36 games. He went on to win his second championship.

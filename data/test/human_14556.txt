Undead is a paranormal romance book series that is written by MaryJanice Davidson and published through Berkley Books. The series was first launched in 2004 with the publication of Undead and Unwed, and as of 2015 there are fourteen books in the series.  Davidson attributes the popularity of the series to the absurdism, tone, and believability of the characters.  The series was a reaction to what Davidson saw as cliches and unrealistic characters in paranormal romance novels. Synopsis  The series follows Betsy Taylor, a woman that loses her job and is killed on the day of her thirtieth birthday. She later awakens in a funeral home and discovers that not only is she a vampire but she's the queen of the vampires.

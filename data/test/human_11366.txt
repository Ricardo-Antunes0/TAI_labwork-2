In cotidianis precibus  is a motu proprio from Pope Pius XII dated 24 March 1945, regarding the new Latin translation of the Psalm to be used in the liturgy. The Latin translation used hitherto had in earlier times been the one made from the Greek Septuagint by Jerome. According to the Pope, Jerome also realised that there must have been flaws in this translation of a translation, and that is why he translated the psalms directly from the Hebrew. However, this latter translations from the original Hebrew did not find its way into the tradition of the Catholic Church, while the Latin translation of the Septuagint became the common translation. This translation from the Septuagint was added to the breviary of Pope Saint  Pius V. Only in the course of the centuries, the Pope says, has the full richness of the original texts (in Hebrew) become apparent, especially through translations made - with the permission of the ecclesiastical authorities - directly from Hebrew into various vernacular languages.

Gwent is a preserved county and former administrative county of Wales. It is located in the south-west of the country and includes the historic towns of Aberystwyth, Lampeter, Llandovery and Brecon.  Gwent is bounded by the historic counties of Cardigan, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire to the north-west, Monmouthshire to the north-east, Powys to the east and Bristol to the south-west. The county population was 210,900 at the 2011 census. The administrative centre is Aberystwyth.  The name Gwent is derived from the Brythonic word "gwent", meaning "a boundary". The first record of Gwent is from 589 AD when it was mentioned as one of four divisions of Dyfed. Gwent was originally a much larger administrative area than it is today and included parts of what are now Monmouthshire, Powys and Carmarthenshire. In 1536, part of Gwent was merged with Brecknockshire to form Cardigan County Council.   In 1889, Gwent County Council was abolished and replaced by Glamorgan County Council. In 1974, Glamorgan County Council was abolished and replaced by West Glamorgan County Council. In 1996, West Glamorgan County Council was abolished and replaced by unitary authorities in Wales created as part of the Government of Wales Act 1998. Aberystwyth Borough Council was formed from the former administrative areas

Non-rocket spacelaunch refers to concepts for launch vehicles that do not use rockets to achieve spaceflight. These concepts may include ground-based or air-launched vehicles, or even spacecraft that are launched into space by being shot out of a cannon.  Non-rocket spacelaunch has been a topic of discussion for many years, as rocket technology has evolved and become more expensive and difficult to develop. This has led to interest in other methods of achieving spaceflight, and some non-rocket spacelaunch concepts have been developed in an attempt to reduce the cost of space travel.  Non-rocket spacelaunch has several advantages over rocket-based launch systems. For example, non-rocket spacelaunch can be used to launch heavier payloads into space than is possible with rockets, and it does not require a secure launch site, meaning that it could be used for spacecraft that are not suitable for a rocket-based launch.  There are a number of challenges that must be overcome before non-rocket spacelaunch can be used on a larger scale. One issue is the development of reliable non-rocket spacelaunch vehicles, which will require a greater degree of engineering expertise than is currently available. Additionally, the regulatory environment governing spaceflight could require changes in order to allow for non-rocket spacelaunch vehicles to be used.

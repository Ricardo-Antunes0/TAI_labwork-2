"Crackerbox Palace" is the ninth track on George Harrison's 1976 album, Thirty Three & 1/3. The song was released as the second single from the album and reached number 19 in the American pop charts. History The song was inspired by Harrison's serendipitous meeting with George Greif. At the 1975 Midem Music Festival, Harrison remarked to Greif that he resembled the late comedian Lord Buckley, whom Harrison had admired for many years. Greif, who had been Buckley's manager, invited Harrison to Buckley's old Los Angeles home, "Crackerbox Palace". Thinking that the phrase had the makings of a song, Harrison jotted the words "Crackerbox Palace" down on a cigarette pack, and later wrote the song. The song includes references to Greif ("I met a Mr. Greif") and to Lord Buckley ("know that the Lord is well and inside of you"). ("Lord" could be a double entendre referring as well to either the Lord God or Lord Krishna.)

Jonny Kennedy (4 November 1966 – 26 September 2003)  was the subject of the documentary The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off, which documented the final months of his life as he suffered from the rare inherited condition known as dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (EB or DEB). He was born with no skin on his left leg. Kennedy ultimately died of skin cancer caused by EB. In the film, which also featured interviews with his friends and family, Kennedy was extremely candid about his feelings concerning his impending death. When the film was first broadcast in March 2004 on Channel 4 in the UK, it attracted around five million viewers and helped to raise £500,000 for the EB charity DebRA. The documentary was voted the sixth most popular film in the Channel 4 programme The 50 Greatest Documentaries of All Time, in 2005.  The documentary was shown again on Channel 4 in May 2020.

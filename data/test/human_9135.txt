Carmen Electra is the self-titled debut studio album by American entertainer Carmen Electra, released in 1993. The album was a project designed by Prince to promote Electra, his latest protégée at the time, as a sexy female rapper. The album features music written by Prince with some input by band member Levi Seacer, Jr. Lyrics were provided by Prince, along with Seacer, The New Power Generation rapper Tony M. and female rapper Monie Love. Four singles were released from the album: "Go-Go Dancer", "Everybody Get on Up", and "Fantasia Erotica". The album was not well received and effectively ended Electra's recording career. In interviews, she has pointed out that during the time of the album's release, Prince was having problems with his label, which could have contributed to its failure.

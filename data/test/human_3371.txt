A Unix domain socket or IPC socket (inter-process communication socket) is a data communications endpoint for exchanging data between processes executing on the same host operating system. Valid socket types in the UNIX domain are:  SOCK_STREAM (compare to TCP) – for a stream-oriented socket  SOCK_DGRAM (compare to UDP) – for a datagram-oriented socket that preserves message boundaries (as on most UNIX implementations, UNIX domain datagram sockets are always reliable and don't reorder datagrams)  SOCK_SEQPACKET (compare to SCTP) – for a sequenced-packet socket that is connection-oriented, preserves message boundaries, and delivers messages in the order that they were sent The Unix domain socket facility is a standard component of POSIX operating systems. The API for Unix domain sockets is similar to that of an Internet socket, but rather than using an underlying network protocol, all communication occurs entirely within the operating system kernel. Unix domain sockets may use the file system as their address name space. (Some operating systems, like Linux, offer additional namespaces.) Processes reference Unix domain sockets as file system inodes, so two processes can communicate by opening the same socket.

Ideomotor Apraxia, often IMA, is a neurological disorder characterized by inability to produce voluntary movement due to damage or loss of nerve cells in the brain that control motor function. IMA can affect any movement, including those used for basic activities such as eating and drinking, dressing, and toileting.  IMA is a rare condition, affecting only a few thousand people worldwide. The cause is unknown, but may be due to damage or loss of nerve cells in the brain that control motor function. IMA can affect any movement, including those used for basic activities such as eating and drinking, dressing, and toileting.  There is no cure for IMA, but treatments exist that can improve quality of life. Treatment options may include physical therapy and speech therapy to help restore function, rehabilitation toaddress underlying causes of the disorder, and medication to treat associated symptoms.

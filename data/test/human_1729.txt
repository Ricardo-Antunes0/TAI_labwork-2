Anne Bryson Sutherland (7 January 1922 - 27 March 2011) was a Scottish plastic surgeon specializing in the care of burn victims. Sutherland was the first woman to be appointed a consultant plastic surgeon, the first woman Chairperson of the British Burn Association and the first woman President of the British Association of Plastic Surgeons. Early life and education  Anne Sutherland was born in Wellford, Broxburn, West Lothian. She was the only child of David Murdoch Sutherland and his wife Margaret Bryson. She attended Bathgate Academy and St Hildaâ€™s School, Liberton, Edinburgh. On leaving school, she had wanted to study medicine, but due to the opposition of her father who thought it an unsuitable career for a woman, she instead attended the Edinburgh College of Domestic Science, and went on to train as a dietician. Four years after her father's death, she began a degree in pure science at the University of Glasgow, but left after a year when she obtained a place on the MB ChB course at the University of Edinburgh, from which she graduated in 1951.

George Elton Mayo (26 December 1880 â€“ 22 February 1962) was an Australian physician, anthropologist and educationalist. He was Professor of Human Biology at the University of Melbourne from 1921 to 1939, and Director of the Institute of Mental Health from 1937 to 1945.  Born in Melbourne to a family of prominent medical practitioners, Mayo enrolled at the University of Melbourne in 1899 to study medicine. He graduated with honours in 1904 and undertook postgraduate training at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In 1911 he married Edith McNeill and they had two children.  After completing his medical training, Mayo began a long and distinguished career as a physician. He served as Director of the Melbourne Hospital from 1912 to 1916, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Melbourne from 1916 to 1921, and Professor of Human Biology at the University of Melbourne from 1921 to 1939. In 1937 he was appointed Director of the Institute of Mental Health, a post he held until 1945.  Mayo's pre-eminence as a scholar was recognised by his appointment as a Member of the Order of Australia in 1939. He retired from his academic posts in 1945 but continued to serve as Director of the Institute until his retirement in 1962. His work in anthropology was largely conducted while he was Director of the Institute, and he is best known for his studies of Australian Aboriginal culture. He died in 1962 at the age of 84.

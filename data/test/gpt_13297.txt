Beethoven (foaled 2 April 2007) is an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was one of the most successful horses in European racing in the 2010s, winning more than sixty races including the Epsom Derby, St Leger Stakes, and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes.  Beethoven is a bay horse with a white blaze and two white socks. He was bred in Kentucky by Wayne Gretzky's Gretna Green Farm. As a juvenile he finished second in the Grade 1 Tampa Bay Derby and then won the Grade 2 Alabama Derby. In 2009 he was undefeated in three races including the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He was retired to stud at the end of that season.  Beethoven has had considerable success as a breeding stallion, siring several major winners including The Phantom (Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe), Street Sense (Derby), Galileo (Grand Prix d'Ispahan), and Distorted Humor (Irish Champion Stakes).

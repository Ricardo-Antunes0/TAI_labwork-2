Hotel Corones is a heritage-listed hotel at 33 Wills Street, Charleville, Shire of Murweh, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by William Hodgen junior and built from 1924 to 1929 by day labour. It is also known as Corones Hotel Norman. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 July 1997. History  The town of Charleville was surveyed in 1867 following the surveying of a number of pastoral runs in the district in 1863. Sited on the banks of the Warrego River along a natural stock route from New South Wales to Western Queensland, the town was to develop as the major service centre for the surrounding pastoral industry. Bullock teams passed through the town, Cobb & Co established stables (as well as a factory for the construction of mail coaches and buggies and an associated sawmill) and in 1888 Charleville's position as a strategic transport node for the south west was confirmed when it became the terminus for the Western railway line (extended south to Cunnamulla in 1898 and west to Quilpie in 1917).

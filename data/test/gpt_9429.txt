In set theory, the core model is a model of set theory that is based on the concept of a core.  The core model is a model of set theory that is based on the concept of a core. A core is a set that contains only itself and its complement. The core model is based on the assumption that every set has at least one core.  The core model has several advantages over other models of set theory. First, the core model is consistent, which means that it does not require any additional axioms to be consistent. Second, the core model is complete, which means that it includes all the properties of sets that are known in classical set theory. Third, the core model is well-founded, which means that it has a foundation in mathematics.

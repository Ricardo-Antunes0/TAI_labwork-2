The Angebilt Hotel is a hotel located in Orlando, Florida at 37 North Orange Avenue. Designed by architect Murray S. King, the 11-story building was built from 1921-1923 and opened on March 14, 1923. It was operated by Joseph Fenner Ange since the Angebilt's opening until May 1923 when he announced bankruptcy and left the hotel. But the next year, it was sold at public auction and re-opened. Then on February 27, 1983, it suffered a fire on the top 2 floors and was closed for renovations. Today, the Angebilt is now offices with bars and retail on the ground floor. History In June 1920, Joseph Fenner Ange, announced plans to build a $1 Million Dollar hotel. The Rosalind Club, which was on the site of the Angebilt Hotel, moved to a new building on Lake Eola and the original building was demolished. In 1921, construction on the Angebilt began. The hotel across the street, the San Juan Hotel, built an 8-story addition to their hotel just so they could stay the best hotel in Orlando.

A Canterbury Tale is a 1944 British drama film directed by George Cukor and starring Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, and John Forbes Nash. The screenplay by Arthur Miller is based on the story The Monk's Tale by Geoffrey Chaucer.  The film is set in the court of King Richard the Lionheart and tells the story of the Knight, Geoffrey Chaucer (Spencer Tracy), who travels to Canterbury to be granted an audience with the king. There he meets up with a group of people – including the jester Parson John (John Forbes Nash), the courtesan Marion (Katharine Hepburn), and the monk Friar Laurence (Hugh Griffith) – who are all attempting to navigate their way through life. The story culminates in a tournament attended by King Richard and his royal court.

Flushing Town Hall is a historic Town Hall located on Northern Boulevard at Linden Place in the Flushing section of the New York City borough of Queens.  Formerly, it served as the seat of government of the village of Flushing, established as Vlissingen in 1645, until the consolidation with New York City in 1898.  It was built in 1862 and is a 2-story, three-by-six-bay, brick building with basement and attic.  A style of architecture that originated in Germany, Rundbogenstil ("round arch style"), was used here and in a number of American buildings of the Civil War Era.  The earliest photographs show the building to have been painted a light color.  The use of paint was discontinued following adhesion problems during a restoration.  A small rear wing was added in 1938 containing a block of jail cells.  The front facade features a triple arched portico topped by a classic entablature with low balustrade. It was listed as a New York City Landmark in 1968 and on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

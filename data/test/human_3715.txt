BW (Bei-Wei or Beiwei, 北威, meaning Northern Might) UAVs are Chinese drones developed by Beijing Co., Ltd. Wei-Biao-Zhi-Yuan Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd. (WBZY, 北京威标智远科技发展有限公司). They are powered by solid rocket motors to achieve lower overall cost in comparison to turbojet engines. According to Zhang Chaoyang (张朝阳) and Liao Yunfei (廖云飞), general designer and general engineer of the BW series (respectively), the drones are designed to simulate anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles such as Hsiung Feng I/II/IIE/III, BrahMos, Harpoon and Tomahawk. They can also be deployed as decoys and reconnaissance drones. BW-I BW-I is a drone designed to simulate low altitude subsonic cruise missile. BW-I has a total of eleven control surfaces with a pair of the smallest installed near the nose section of the fuselage. The midsection of the fuselage of BW-II has a total of five control surfaces installed, with three larger trapezoid shaped control surfaces in a reverse T configuration, and in the belly of the midsection, there are two smaller rectangular control surfaces. At the tail section of the fuselage, there are four rectangular control surfaces in cruciform and these control surfaces are also the largest. Specification: Speed: 0.7 – 0.9 Mach Cruise altitude: 100 – 300 m Range: > 25 km Course accuracy: better than 15° Heigh accuracy: better than 50 m Engine: solid rocket motor

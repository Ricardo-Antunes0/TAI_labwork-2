Chinese Indonesians  and colloquially Chindos, are Indonesians of full or partial Chinese descent. They are the third largest ethnic group in Indonesia after the Javanese and Sundanese.  The earliest Chinese Indonesians arrived in the Indonesian archipelago during the first century CE, when traders and missionaries from the Tang Dynasty sailed to Southeast Asia. Many of the early Chinese Indonesians were merchants and traders, who intermarried with the locals. As a result, the Chinese Indonesian cultural heritage is a mixture of Chinese and local Indonesian elements.  During the colonial era, most Chinese Indonesians were brought into Dutch colonial society as indentured labourers. After independence, many Chinese Indonesians achieved high positions in the new Indonesian government and business empire. However, there has been a significant population decline in recent years, as many Chinese Indonesians have left for more prosperous countries such as Australia and the United States.  The Chinese Indonesian community is also diverse in terms of religion. While almost all Chinese Indonesians are Muslims, there are also sizeable Christian and Buddhist communities.

Stereolithography (SLA or SL; also known as stereolithography 3D printing) is a three-dimensional printing process used to create objects from digital models by building them up one layer at a time. The name derives from the Greek words stereos (solid) and lithos (stone).  The technology was invented in 1986 by Peter Debye and his colleague Jens C. Kristiansen, at the University of Copenhagen. Early stereolithography machines used a stereolithography film as the printing medium. The film was a sheet of clear plastic or glass that had been treated with a special resin that hardened when exposed to ultraviolet light. The ultraviolet radiation generated by the light source cured the resin, forming a hard surface on which the next layer of material could be deposited. The stereolithography process can create very detailed three-dimensional objects from thin layers of material by building them up one layer at a time.  The first 3D printer capable of producing objects with more than one layer was developed at the University of Utah in 2004 by researchers Jason Smith and Greg DeKoenig.

Operation Bellicose was an attack by Avro Lancaster bombers of No. 5 Group RAF on the German city of Dortmund on 17 August 1944. The raid was part of the Allied air offensive against the Ruhr area, and was intended to destroy the factories and rail infrastructure that were essential to the German war effort.  The bombers attacked Dortmund at about 07:15 local time, flying in pairs at altitudes of up to 12,000 feet (3,700 metres). The raid was generally successful, with most of the targets destroyed or seriously damaged. However, some buildings were also destroyed by mistake, and civilian casualties occurred. Overall, the raid killed around 260 civilians, injured more than 1,000, and caused damage totalling millions of Reichsmarks.  The bombing raid on Dortmund was one of a series of attacks carried out by No. 5 Group in August 1944 as part of Operation Bellicose. The objective of the operation was to destroy the factories and rail infrastructure that were essential to the German war effort in order to reduce Germany's capacity to wage war. The bombing raids were particularly important because they could be conducted from high altitudes without being hampered by enemy fighter defences.  The bombers that participated in Operation Bellicose were Avro Lancaster bombers operated by No. 5 Group RAF. The aircraft used in the attack on Dortmund were Mk III Lancaster bombers, which had been modified for use as night bombers. The Mk III Lancaster was typically armed with a payload of 4,000 pounds (1,800 kilograms

Jiří Čart (German: Georg Czarth, Zarth, Czard, Szarth, Tzarth, or Zardt; 8 April 1708  – c. 1780) was a Bohemian composer, violinist and flautist of the late baroque period. Life  Georg Czarth was born in Vysoká. He received his first musical instruction from his father, Lukas Lorenz, cantor in Havlíčkův Brod and teacher of Johann Stamitz. After attending school in Vysoká, Czarth furthered his musical education in Prague and then, at the age of 17, in Vienna. In Vienna he received violin instruction from the Royal Court musicians Franz Josef Timmer and Johann Otto Rosetter (1690–1752); and from Biarelli he learned the flute. In Vienna he also met the violinist Franz Benda and in 1729 the two musicians left Vienna. After being joined in Breslau (today Wrocław) by the violinist Carl Höckh and the hornist Wilhelm Weidner they searched for better employment opportunities in Poland. In Warsaw, Czarth and the three other musicians were taken into the employment of the Starosta Jan Suchorzewski and formed part of a small orchestra of around nine musicians.<ref>Douglas A.

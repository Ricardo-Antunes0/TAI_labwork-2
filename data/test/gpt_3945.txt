Bing for mobile (formerly Live Search Mobile) is a location-based search service developed by Microsoft as part of its Bing search engine. It allows users to search for businesses, places, events, and more by location.  Bing Mobile was first released in November 2011 as a complement to the main Bing search engine. The app was free to download from the App Store and Google Play, and offered a number of features not available on the main Bing search engine, including the ability to query for nearby businesses and places. In April 2013, Bing Mobile was renamed Live Search Mobile, and added support for real-time updates of results for local businesses. In November 2013, Microsoft announced that it would be closing down Live Search Mobile in favor of Bing Mobile.  Bing Mobile can be used to search for businesses, places, events, and more by location. Results are updated in real-time as you search, making it a useful tool for finding information about local businesses.

Pensamiento Serpentino (Serpentine Thought) is a poem by Chicano playwright Luis Valdez originally published by Cucaracha Publications, which was part of El Teatro Campesino, in 1973. The poem famously draws on philosophical concepts held by the Mayan people known as In Lak'ech, meaning "you are the other me." The poem also draws, although less prominently, on Aztec traditions, such as through the appearance of Quetzalcoatl. The poem received national attention after it was illegally banned as part of the removal of Mexican American Studies Programs in Tucson Unified School District. The ban was later ruled unconstitutional. Themes  Scholar Sheila Marie Contreras states that the poem "brings together Christian and Mesoamerican religious symbolism" and that it serves as a model for liberation and education which challenges dominant cultural conventions. Valdez drew on Mesoamerican themes through the work of Mayan scholar Domingo Martinez Paredez. As scholar Yolanda Broyles-Gonzalez states, Valdez incorporates "Indigenous knowledge" in his work, replacing Judeo-Christian belief instead with a call to "return to Indigenous spirituality to revitalize ancient cultural practices that could enable Chicanas/os to resist more successfully the debilitating effects of Anglo-American hegemony." For Valdez, Indigenous ways of knowing are thus essential to Chicano/a spiritual liberation.

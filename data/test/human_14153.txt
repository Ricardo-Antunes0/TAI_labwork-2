Peshotanu (Avestan , Middle Persian Peshyotan, Peshotan) is an eschatological figure of the medieval texts of Zoroastrian tradition, in particular in the apocalyptic Zand-i Wahman yasn. In these texts, Peshotanu is an assistant of the Saoshyant, the future benefactor who brings about the final renovation of the world. In these texts, Peshotanu is also one of the Zoroastrian "immortals" (anoshag-ruwan, "of immortal soul"), and the name peshotanu is an allusion to this idea; the Avestan language word literally means "of surrendered (pesh-) body (-tan)", and is also used as a common adjective as a euphemism for "deceased" (also in a derogatory sense of "of forfeited body" in the context of capital offenses). The development of the legend of Peshotanu has been traced from that of a dead prince whose departed spirit is honored (Yasht 13.103) to that of the eschatological hero who is "he is immortal, undecaying, hungerless, and thirstless, living and predominant in both existences, those of the embodied beings and of the spirits." (Denkard 4.81)

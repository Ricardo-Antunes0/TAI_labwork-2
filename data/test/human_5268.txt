Lamotte's roundleaf bat (Hipposideros lamottei) is a species of bat found only at Mount Nimba on the border of Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea and Liberia. It is critically endangered. Taxonomy It was described as a new species in  1984 by French zoologist André Brosset. He chose the species name lamottei after Dr. Maxime Lamotte, who was also a French zoologist. Its status as a species has been called into question, and some suggested that it might be synonymous with Noack's roundleaf bat, Hipposideros ruber. While its mitochondrial gene for cytochrome b may only differ from that of H. ruber by only 6%, a 2013 study found that it was morphologically distinct from it. Based on its morphology, it is in the caffer/ruber species complex of its genus. Other species in this complex include: Sundevall's roundleaf bat, H. caffer Noack's roundleaf bat, H. ruber H. tephrus Based on genetic analysis, it has been hypothesized that Lamotte's roundleaf bat has only recently become isolated from Noack's roundleaf bat, evolving to become a high-altitude specialist. Lamotte's roundleaf bat and other members of its species complex are members of the bicolor group of the genus Hipposideros. Other members of the bicolor group include:

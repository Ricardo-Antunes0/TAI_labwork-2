George Ellery Hale (June 29, 1868 â€“ October 12, 1958) was an American astronomer and astrophysicist who worked on the theory of the solar system. He was also a noted astronomer and historian of astronomy, and a pioneer in the study of galaxies.  Hale was born in Westfield, New Jersey, on June 29, 1868. After graduating from Yale University in 1892, he studied at the University of Berlin under Friedrich Bessel. In 1895 he received his doctorate from Yale, and returned to the United States to become an assistant at Harvard University. In 1902 he was appointed professor of astronomy at the University of Chicago, where he remained until his retirement in 1946.  Hale is best known for his work on the theory of the solar system, particularly his theory that the planets were formed out of gas and dust particles which were drawn into a disc around the sun. His work on galaxies also attracted significant attention, and he is credited with being one of the founders of modern observational astrophysics. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1923, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1928. He died on October 12, 1958.

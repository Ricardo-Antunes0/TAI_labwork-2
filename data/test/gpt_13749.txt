Reston virus (RESTV) is one of six known viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a viral respiratory illness. The virus was first identified in 2003 and has caused several outbreaks in the Middle East and Asia. Reston virus is similar to SARS-CoV, the causative agent of SARS, but is less pathogenic and does not cause extensive disease.

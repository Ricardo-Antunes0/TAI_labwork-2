IDT Spectrum, a subsidiary of IDT Corporation, holds and leases fixed wireless spectrum. History IDT Spectrum, Inc. and IDT Spectrum, LLC, are subsidiaries of IDT Corporation , an international holding company, with interests primarily in the telecommunications and energy industries. In December 2001, IDT Corporation through its subsidiary Winstar Holdings, LLC, acquired FCC spectrum licenses and other assets from the bankruptcy estate of Winstar Communications. Winstar Holdings formed a subsidiary company, Winstar Spectrum, LLC, to hold its spectrum licenses and then caused the spectrum licenses to be assigned to it. As part of an internal corporate reorganization, in December 2004, Winstar Holdings formed IDT Spectrum, LLC, and caused Winstar Spectrum, LLC to transfer and assign to IDT Spectrum, LLC all of its FCC licenses except for six point-to-point licenses that are not used in our business. In January 2005, Winstar Holdings formed IDT Spectrum and contributed to IDT Spectrum all of its interests in IDT Spectrum, LLC, as well as other assets used in its connectivity services.

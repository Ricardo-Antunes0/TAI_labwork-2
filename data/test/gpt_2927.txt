1st Avenue, also known as Cumberland Avenue, is a major east-west street in the Near North Side of Chicago, Illinois. The street runs from Congress Street on the south to Madison Street on the north and is named after Cumberland County, Kentucky.  The first settlers in what is now Chicago arrived in 1833 and quartered themselves around what was then called "the Fort Dearborn." The area that is now 1st Avenue began to develop as a commercial center in the 1840s when it became the heart of Chicago's retail district. In 1853, Mayor John Wentworth named the street after Richard M. Johnson, then Senator from Kentucky. At the time, Johnson was one of the most influential men in Washington.  1st Avenue continued to grow in importance throughout the mid-19th century as it became home to numerous businesses, including banks, insurance companies, and retailers. By 1890, 1st Avenue was known as "the most important shopping street in the world." In 1907, a subway was installed along 1st Avenue, which made it easier for shoppers to get from one end of the street to the other.  Today, 1st Avenue remains an important commercial street and is home to many popular restaurants and businesses. The avenue has also been gentrified over the years and now features high-end stores and restaurants as well as housing developments.

Katharina Schroth was born (February 22, 1894 – February 19, 1985) in Dresden, Germany with scoliosis. Her treatment path was to wear thoracic braces to try to fix her diagnosis. She was sick of wearing the braces and over her lifetime found ways to use breathing techniques and different manipulation processes using pulley systems and different stretches to fix the scoliosis. She had started two different institutes that taught and used these techniques to other individuals who also had scoliosis. The first was in opened in 1921 and was called Breathing Orthopedics and was in Meissen Germany. The second institute opened was in Sobernheim. The techniques used are now known as the Schroth Method and are still implemented today. The Schroth method helped to change the way of healing scoliosis and set the precedent for how other techniques were developed. She was given the award of The Federal Cross of Merit by the Federal Republic of Germany. These institutes were passed down to her daughter, Christa Lehnert-Schroth, and to her daughter’s son, Dr. Hans-Rudolf Weiss, MD. Her grandson is still alive and has his own practice of where he uses modifications of his grandmother’s techniques to help those with scoliosis today. Personal life

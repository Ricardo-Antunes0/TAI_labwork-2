The Referendum Party was a Eurosceptic, single-issue political party in the United Kingdom.  The Referendum Party was founded in 2009 by former Conservative MP Sir Roger Gale. It was formed in an attempt to capitalise on public concerns about the implications of the European Union and the Lisbon Treaty, which had been ratified in 2007. The party's main policy focus was on renegotiating or withdrawing from the EU. It also advocated for a return to a British parliamentary system of government, and for a reduction in the power and size of the British bureaucracy.  The Referendum Party failed to win any seats in the House of Commons at the 2010 general election, but did make significant gains in local government elections that year. In 2013, it merged with the UK Independence Party (UKIP) to form the United Kingdom Independence Party - Referendum Party (UKIP-RP).

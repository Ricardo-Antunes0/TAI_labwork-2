Eucalyptus transcontinentalis, commonly known as redwood or coast redwood, is a eucalyptus species that is endemic to the eastern coast of North America from Maine to Florida.  Eucalyptus transcontinentalis is a tall tree that can reach up to 100 feet in height and 50 feet in diameter. The bark is smooth and red-brown in color, and the leaves are ovate-oblong with a pointed tip, and are about 4 inches long and 1 inch wide. The flowers are white and borne in clusters at the end of the branches. The fruit is a capsule that turns brown when it matures.  Eucalyptus transcontinentalis is found only on coastal areas of the eastern United States, from Maine to Florida. It grows best in sandy soils near the water's edge, and can withstand saltwater flooding. It is threatened by habitat loss, and is currently considered endangered by the US Department of the Interior.

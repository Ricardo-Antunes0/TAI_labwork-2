Anaerobic corrosion (also known as hydrogen corrosion) is a form of metal corrosion occurring in anoxic water. Typically following aerobic corrosion, anaerobic corrosion involves a redox reaction that reduces hydrogen ions and oxidizes a solid metal. This process can occur in either abiotic conditions through a thermodynamically spontaneous reaction or biotic conditions through a process known as bacterial anaerobic corrosion. Along with other forms of corrosion, anaerobic corrosion is significant when considering the safe, permanent storage of chemical waste. Chemical mechanisms  The overall process of corrosion can be represented by a bimodal function, where the type of corrosion varies with time, including both oxygen-driven and anaerobic mechanisms. The dominant process will depend on the given conditions. During oxygen-driven corrosion, layers of rust form, creating various non-homogenous anoxic niches throughout the metal's surface. Within the niches the diffusion of oxygen is inhibited, leading to the ideal conditions for anaerobic corrosion to occur.

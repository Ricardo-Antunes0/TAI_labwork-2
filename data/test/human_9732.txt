One day, he encounters Megalo Boxing champion Yuri and decides to defeat him in the competition. Joe enters the ring for his first professional match, but shocks the whole arena by not wearing any gear for the fight, being dubbed "Gearless" Joe, this is all part of Nanbu's plan to have him attract attention. He reppears in the 2021 sequel Megalobox 2: Nomad as a depressed man escaping from his past while meeting immigrants who he befriends while also coming to terms with the sin he committed. As Megalobox is a tribute to the manga Ashita no Joe, Joe was loosely based on the lead Jo Yabuki. The character was created by director Yo Moriyama who used real life boxers as his inspirations for the fighting style. Similar to Jo, Joe's narrative was made as an homage to his rivalry he has with Yuri's original concept, Rikishi. Joe's more depressed personality was something the staff heavily discussed in the making of the sequel as they aimed to give him a notable character arc. He is voiced by Yoshimasa Hosoya in Japanese and Kaiji Tang in English.

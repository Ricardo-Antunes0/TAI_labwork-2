The Lansalson branch line (also known as the Lansalton Branch, the Lansalton Railway, or the Lansalton and Northumberland Railway) was a railway line in Northumberland, England.  Opened on 1 July 1848, it ran from Alnwick to Morpeth. It closed to passenger services on 31 December 1955, but remains open as a heritage railway. The line has been described as "one of the most scenic railways in Britain".  The line was built by the North Eastern Railway (NER) as part of its main route between London and Edinburgh. It was named after George Lansalton, the company's chairman. The NER opened the line to passengers on 1 July 1848.  In 1854, the NER agreed to lease the line from George Lansalton and Thomas Robson for Â£25,000 per year. The lease gave the LNER control of the line and allowed it to increase its shareholding in the NER. The LNER made further investments in the line, including the construction of two viaducts - at Heddon-on-the-Wall and Birtley - in 1884 and 1888 respectively.  The North Eastern Railway (NER) became part of British Railways (BR) on 1 January 1948. On 31 December 1955, passenger services were discontinued on the Lansalson branch line. The last train ran on 31 December 1955. The line remained open as a heritage railway until 2003.

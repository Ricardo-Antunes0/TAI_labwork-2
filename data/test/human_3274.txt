The Moray Coast Railway was a heavy rail route in Morayshire, Scotland. It was opened in three phases by the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) between 1884 and 1886. The line ran from the Banff, Portsoy and Strathisla Railway in Portsoy to the Morayshire Railway in Elgin. Trains were operated by the Great North of Scotland Railway until 1923, when the route was taken over by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The LNER operated the route from 1923 until 1948 when Britain's railways were nationalised to form British Railways, who operated the route until its closure in 1968. Opening In 1881 the Great North of Scotland Railway put a bill to parliament to extend its Grange to Portsoy line along the Moray coast as far as Buckie. In 1882 the GNoSR applied for permission to build a  line from Portsoy to Elgin via Buckie. The first  section was opened between Portsoy and Tochieneal in 1884 with one intermediate station at Glassaugh. The following year the section between Garmouth and the Morayshire Railway in Elgin was opened, with intermediate stations at Urquhart and Calcots. Finally in 1886, the line was completed between Garmouth and Tochieneal, with intermediate stations at Spey Bay, Portgordon, Buckpool, Buckie, Portessie, Findochty, Portknockie and Cullen. The Countess of Seafield did not allow a direct route to be built through Cullen House grounds so three large viaducts were built over the town.

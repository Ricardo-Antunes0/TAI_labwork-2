For several years parallel hardware was only available on supercomputers. Parallel programming was hard to do on the mainstream platforms.     With the development of multicore CPUs, parallel programming has become easier. Multicore CPUs can handle multiple tasks at the same time, making it possible to parallelize code. Parallel programming is a technique that allows software developers to take advantage of multiple processors in order to achieve faster performance.   Parallel programming is a technique that allows software developers to take advantage of multiple processors in order to achieve faster performance.   Multicore processors are now available on many mainstream platforms, making parallel programming easier than ever before. Parallel programming is a way of dividing a program into parts that can be run on different processors in parallel. This can reduce the time it takes to complete a task by dividing it up among the available processors.

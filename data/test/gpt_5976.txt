Ombre (, pronounced "omber") or l'Hombre is a technique in painting and drawing, also used in printmaking and sculpture, where two or more colors are blended together to create the effect of shadows.  The word "ombre" is French for "shadow", and the technique is named after the Italian term for "shadow" (ombra), because the shadows created with ombre are often reminiscent of the dark sides of things. Ombre may be achieved by adding black to a color, making it darker; by adding white to a color, making it lighter; or by adding a color that is less bright than the other two, making the shadows lighter. The basic principle is to add light to dark areas, and dark to light areas.

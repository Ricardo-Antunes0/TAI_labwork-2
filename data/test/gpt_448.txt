Thomas George Anstruther Molloy (4 October 1852 – 18 November 1927) was an Irish novelist, short story writer, and dramatist. He is best known for his novels The Interpreter of Maladies (1892) and The Catcher in the Rye (1951).  Molloy was born in Dublin, the oldest of eight children of Thomas Molloy, a clerk in the Department of Agriculture, and his wife, Margaret (née French). Molloy was educated at Belvedere College and Trinity College, Dublin. He worked as a journalist for a time, but began to write full-time in 1880. He achieved some early success with short stories and novels, but it was with The Interpreter of Maladies that he achieved international recognition. Set in India during the days of British colonialism, the novel tells the story of an Irish doctor who is slowly consumed by insanity. It has been described as one of the most important Irish novels of the late 19th century.  Molloy's later works include The Catcher in the Rye (1951), which has been described as one of the most famous American novels ever written, and The Tower Treasure (1928), a novel set in 17th-century Ireland. Molloy died in Dublin aged 83.

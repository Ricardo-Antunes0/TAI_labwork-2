Branson West Airport, also known as Branson Airport, is a public airport located in Branson, Missouri. It is named for businessman and entertainer Larry L. Branson. The airport covers an area of 1,000 acres (400 ha) and has four runways. It is the main commercial airport for Branson, handling more than two million passengers annually.  The airport was opened in 1946 and served as a training facility for the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. It was also used by the United States Navy as a flight training center. After the war, the airport was used as a civilian airfield by several airlines. In 1971, it was purchased by Trans World Airlines and became their primary hub in the Mid-America region. The airline was subsequently bought by Delta Air Lines and the airport became Delta's primary hub in Missouri. In 2003, Delta transferred its headquarters to Atlanta and the airport has since been used mainly for charter flights and private aviation.  Branson West Airport is served by six airlines: American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines. The airport has two terminals: Terminal 1 which handles Delta Air Lines and American Airlines flights; and Terminal 3 which handles all other airlines.

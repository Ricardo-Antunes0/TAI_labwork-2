The Münster Feud was a series of civil wars fought in the medieval Bishopric of Münster between supporters of the Bishop and opponents, culminating in the 1555 Peace of Celle. The principal combatants were the faction led by Johannes Bugenhagen, who wished to preserve the independence of the Bishopric, and the faction led by Philip Melanchthon, which sought to subject it to Lutheran rule. The conflict escalated into open warfare in 1508, and continued until 1555.  The Münster Feud is significant both for its duration and for its consequences. The wars resulted in heavy losses for both sides, and left the Bishopric deeply divided. They also served as a training ground for future Protestant leaders, and are generally seen as marking the beginning of the Protestant Reformation in Germany.

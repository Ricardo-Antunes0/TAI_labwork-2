Sir Roger George Moore  (14 October 192723 May 2017) was an English actor. He was the third actor to portray the fictional British secret agent James Bond in the Eon Productions film series, playing the character in seven feature films between 1973 and 1985. Moore's seven appearances as Bond, from Live and Let Die to A View to a Kill, are the most of any actor in the Eon-produced entries. On television, Moore played the lead role of Simon Templar, the title character in the British mystery thriller series The Saint (1962–1969). He also had roles in American series in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including Beau Maverick on the Western Maverick, where he replaced James Garner as one of the leads for the 1960-61 season. He was also co-lead of the British action-comedy The Persuaders! (1971–1972) opposite Tony Curtis, in which he played a suave, trouble-solving gentleman similar to his James Bond and Simon Templar characters.

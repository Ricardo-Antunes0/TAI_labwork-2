A frequent-flyer program (FFP) (or frequent-flyer programme) is a loyalty program or scheme that allows travellers to earn points or miles by flying regularly.  The first such program was introduced in 1951 by Pan American World Airways, and today, there are numerous FFPs in operation. Many airlines offer FFPs, which can be used to purchase tickets, upgrades, and other benefits. Some FFPs also allow members to trade points for cash or other goods and services.  Some FFPs are affiliated with airlines or travel companies, while others are independent. Many FFPs are operated by airlines and travel companies themselves, while others are operated by third-party partners.

Bhawani Mandir (Temple of Goddess Bhawani) was a Hindu temple dedicated to the goddess Bhawani located in the city of Lucknow, in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The temple was built in 1863 by Raja Jai Singh II and was the largest and most ornate Hindu temple in North India.  The temple complex consisted of a square main building, with four smaller pavilions surrounding it. The main shrine was oriented towards the east, with a circumambulatory path around it. There were also shrines to other deities within the temple complex. The entrance gate was flanked by two naked elephant sculptures.  The temple was closed for public worship in 1988 and is now used as a museum. The grounds are open to the public for tours on weekends.

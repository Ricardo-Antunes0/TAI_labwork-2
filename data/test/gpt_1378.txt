The Pidkamin massacre or the Podkamień massacre was a mass killing that took place in the village of Pidkamin, Podkamień County, Lublin Voivodeship, in the early hours of 21 February 1943.  The massacre was perpetrated by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army against the Polish civilian population, comprising men, women and children, who had been taken hostage in order to force the Polish population to flee. The majority of the victims were massacred in their homes.  The massacre is one of the most notorious episodes of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army's campaign of terror against the Poles in Poland during World War II.

On Velvet is a 1938 British musical romantic film directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. The screenplay is by Powell and Pressburger and the music is by Maurice Jarre.  The film is set in the early 1900s and tells the story of a young man, David (played by Richard Attenborough), who falls in love with a young woman, Gita (played by Ann Todd). Gita is the daughter of an Indian aristocrat, who disapproves of David's working-class background. Despite these obstacles, the couple eventually marry and have a son.  Powell and Pressburger had worked together on several previous films, including The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943), Black Narcissus (1946), and The Red Shoes (1948), but On Velvet was their first collaboration as directors. The film was a major success when released, winning several awards, including three Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director for Powell and Best Screenplay for Powell and Pressburger.

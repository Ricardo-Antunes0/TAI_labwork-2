Ni(IV) organometallic complexes (Nickel(IV)-centered organometallic complexes) are a class of compounds containing nickel and at least one organometallic element, such as nitrogen, sulfur, or arsenic. Ni(IV) complexes are important ligands in chemistry and have a wide range of applications, including catalysis, electronics, and renewable energy.  Ni(IV) complexes are often prepared by the reaction of nickelous acids with organometallic reagents. The most common Nickel(IV) complex is nickelocene, which is a ligand in the SN2 reaction. Nickelocene is also an important starting material for the preparation of other Nickel(IV) complexes.

Spiridon Ilo (30 September 1876 – 7 November 1950) was one of the founding fathers of Albania as a signatory of the Albanian Declaration of Independence. Ilo was born in Korçë, in the Manastir Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire (present-day Albania) in 1876. He worked as a teacher in the girls' school of his home town founded by the Kyrias family. He later emigrated to Bucharest where he was part and active member of the Albanian colony. In December 1909, he participate in the theatrical play "Besa" (English: Faith) together with Dhimitër Beratti.  Ilo is said to have brought the Albanian flag to Albania in the Declaration of Independence in 1912, one of the versions of the non well-clarified origin of the Albanian flag of the 28 November 1912. The mostly accepted version so far is that the flag was embroidered by his relative Marigo Posio.  In 1913, he returned to Romania and in 1916 emigrated to New York where he continued his patriotic work.

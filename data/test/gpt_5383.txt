He's A Smoothie (foaled 1963 in Ontario) is a Canadian Champion Thoroughbred racehorse. He is best known for his win in the 1973 Queen's Plate, Canada's most prestigious horse race.  He's A Smoothie was bred in Ontario by the late W.O. "Bill" Dixon and raced on Dixon's behalf by trainer Noel Ribot. He was sired by the influential stallion Sail Away, who also sired Secretariat, and his dam was the broodmare My Lady.  As a two-year-old, He's A Smoothie ran second in the Ontario Jockey Club Challenge Stakes and then finished fourth in the Woodward Stakes before winning the 1973 Queen's Plate over ten opponents at Woodbine Racetrack.  He's A Smoothie retired to stud at Claiborne Farm in Kentucky where he had some success as a breeding stallion. His best offspring include the 1979 Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse, Vancouver Slew and Street Sense.

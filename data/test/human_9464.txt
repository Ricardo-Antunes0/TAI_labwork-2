Ladycross was a Catholic preparatory school in Seaford, East Sussex. Founded in 1891 in Briely Road, Bournemouth, and moving to a purpose built school in Eastbourne Road, Seaford in 1909, more than 2,000 pupils attended it before its closure in 1977. Among its schoolmasters was children's book author George Mills, who taught during the summer of 1956.  The school was located on its own 15-acre premises in Seaford from 1909 until 1978, apart from a short period during the Second World War when at the height of the German bombing raids on British towns in 1941, the school was temporarily evacuated to Salperton Park, Gloucestershire. History The school was found in 1891 by Alfred Roper, who later passed it onto his son Tony Roper. Tony Roper had no descendants and in the early 1950s, as he became more elderly, he sought a successor as owner and headmaster from among the parents of children at the school. The only parent interested was Michael Feeny who was a descendant of a Birmingham Catholic family and who had one son at the school at the time. As a school teacher and classicist himself, Feeny had experience in the education business, and over the next quarter century in conjunction with long-serving staff members he ran the school to the satisfaction of a growing body of parents.

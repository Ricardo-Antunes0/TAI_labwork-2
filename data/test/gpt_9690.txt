Simulated Real Time is a literary method that employs a computer simulation to create a realistic and immersive environment for the reader. The environment is created by manipulating a series of variables, which allows the author to control the reader's experience. The aim of this literary approach is to create an experience that is as close to reality as possible, without the need for any actual reality to be present.

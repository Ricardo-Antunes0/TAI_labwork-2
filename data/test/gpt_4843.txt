MACHO-1997-BLG-41, commonly abbreviated as 97-BLG-41 or MACHO-97-BLG-41, is a Type Ia supernova that was observed in the constellation Machus in 1997. It was the first supernova to be observed in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and is also one of the brightest type Ia supernovae ever observed.  The event was detected on July 25, 1997 by the Supernova Search Team II at the Palomar Observatory in California, and was initially classified as a type Ic supernova. However, later observations using Hubble Space Telescope showed that the supernova was in fact a type Ia event, meaning it had the characteristic of being caused by the explosion of a white dwarf star.

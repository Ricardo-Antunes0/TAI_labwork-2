Nested wells, also referred to as nested aquifers, are water wells that are located within an underground aquifer system. The term "nested well" typically refers to wells that are located within a 100-foot (30 m) radius of each other. Nested wells provide an important supplemental water supply for communities in arid and semi-arid areas.  Nested wells were first used in the Middle East over 2,000 years ago. They were later adopted by the Europeans in the late 18th century as a means of exploiting the natural resources of deep aquifers. Today, nested well technology is used around the world to provide supplemental water supplies for communities in arid and semi-arid areas.  The benefits of using nested wells include:   1. Nested wells can provide a reliable and supplemental water supply for communities in arid and semi-arid areas.  2. Nested wells are easy to drill and maintain, making them a cost-effective option compared to other water sources.  3. Nested wells can be situated close to potential sources of water, minimizing transportation costs.  4. Nested wells can be used to monitor and manage water resources, ensuring that they are used efficiently and sustainably.

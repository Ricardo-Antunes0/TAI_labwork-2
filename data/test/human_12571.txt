The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history The Matthew Bowen Homestead stands on over  just west of the junction of Plaine Hill Road with Connecticut Route 169.    It consists of a five-building farm complex on  of land, located southwest of Woodstock Hill.  The main house of the complex is a -story wood-frame structure, six bays wide, with a tall hip roof.  It was built in 1816, and underwent two major periods of alteration before achieving its present configuration.  Originally five bays wide, Victorian porches and a turret were added in the 1880s, but largely removed in the late 1920s, at which time it was extended to six bays.  The house is connected to 19th-century farm buildings, including two barns and a carriage house.  A 1930s vintage Cape house stands at a remove from the main complex.

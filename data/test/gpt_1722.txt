The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union was an agreement among the thirteen American states that created the United States of America. The Articles of Confederation were drafted in 1781 and ratified by the states in 1787. The Articles of Confederation provided for a weak central government with limited powers. The central government was to be composed of a Senate and a House of Representatives. The Articles also did not provide for a uniform currency, which led to the creation of the United Statesdollar.

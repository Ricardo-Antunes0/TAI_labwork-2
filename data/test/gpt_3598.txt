Baby Chaos are a Scottish rock band formed in 2007. They first came to prominence when they released their debut EP, "The Great Escape" in 2008. The EP was well received by critics, who praised the band's youthful and energetic sound.  The band's second EP, "In the Beginning", was released in 2009 and again received positive reviews. Baby Chaos toured extensively throughout 2009 and 2010, supporting such bands as The Fratellis and The Vines. Their third EP, "Declaration of Independence", was released in 2011 and saw the band branching out into more experimental territory.  In late 2013, Baby Chaos announced that they were splitting up. However, they have since regrouped and are currently working on new material.

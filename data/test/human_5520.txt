Richmond Theological Seminary (RTS) was a higher education institution in Richmond, Virginia, serving former slaves after the American Civil War. It had its beginnings in November 1865 when the American Baptist Home Mission Society (ABHMS) sponsored Joseph Getchell Binney (formerly of Columbian College in Washington, DC, and later of Karen Theological Seminary in Rangoon, Burma) a short-lived class in Richmond, VA for theological training of African-Americans. Around the same time, the National Theological Institute of Washington, DC was forming schools for ministerial training of freedmen in Washington and Augusta, GA.  They sponsored Nathaniel Colver to form a school in Richmond, VA, which commenced in Lumpkin's jail, formerly a slave trading facility, in late 1867.  Robert Ryland was hired as an instructor the first year.  Both Dr. Colver and Dr. Ryland resigned after one year, and in 1868, Charles Henry Corey was transferred from the Augusta Institute (which was later to become Morehouse College) and commenced classes in October.  At the recommendation of Dr. Ryland, a female instructor was hired at half the pay he had received.  The school took the name Colver Institute in 1869.

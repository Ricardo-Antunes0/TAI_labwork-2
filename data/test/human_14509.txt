Hans Joachim Iwand (; 11 July 1899 – 2 May 1960) was a German Lutheran theologian. Iwand's thought was considerably influenced by Karl Barth. Early life After finishing high school in 1917 in Görlitz, Iwand studied Protestant theology at the University of Breslau (modern Wrocław, Poland). A year later, towards the end of World War I, he was drafted for military service. After the war, he was stationed for six months on the Silesian border before continuing his studies in Breslau and studying for two semesters at University of Halle-Wittenberg in Halle. His teachers were Erich Schaeder (1861–1936), Hans von Soden (1881–1945), and Rudolf Hermann (1887–1962). After graduating in 1923 he was superintendent of studies at the Lutherheim in Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) in East Prussia. Iwand earned his doctorate in 1924 and his habilitation in 1927, and he took his second theological examination in 1928. From 1927 to 1934 he was a privatdozent (associate professor) at the University of Königsberg.

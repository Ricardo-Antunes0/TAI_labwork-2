Jarid Lukosevicius is a Canadian ice hockey right wing who currently plays for the Abbotsford Canucks. He was named as the NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player for Denver during the program's national championship in 2017. Playing career Lukosevicius began his college career in the fall of 2015 and had a fairly pedestrian freshman season. Though he did not contribute much offensively, Lukosevicius did help the Pioneers reach the Frozen Four. Lukosevicius found his game as a sophomore, more than tripling his point production and helped lead Denver to its first conference title in seven years. While Denver fell in the NCHC semifinals, the team's record was still strong enough to earn them the top overall seed for the NCAA Tournament. Lukosevicius scored twice in the regional final against Penn State, including the game-winner, but it was in the National championship match where he came to life. In a just less than 8 minute span in the second period, Lukosevicius scored three goals to give Denver a lead it would ride to the end. Lukosevicius' hat-trick was the first in a championship game since 1993 which, coincidentally, was recorded by his coach, Jim Montgomery.

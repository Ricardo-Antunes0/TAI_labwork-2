Hari Dev Shourie (1911–2005) was a well-known Indian historian, political commentator and journalist. He is considered to be one of the most important voices of the Indian National Congress.

He began his career as a journalist with the Daily Telegraph in London and then returned to India to join the Indian Express as its Political Editor. In 1954, he was appointed Chief Editor of the Illustrated Weekly of India, a post he held until 1965.  Shourie's first book, The World of Nehru (1958), was a highly critical biography of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India.

Edward Darcy Esquire v Thomas Allin of Lambton  The famous case of Edward Darcy v Thomas Allin of Lambton is a legal dispute that has been recorded in history. The case began on 12 December 1809, when Edward Darcy Esquire, an upper-class gentleman, sued Thomas Allin of Lambton, an industrialist, for defamation. The suit was brought about after Mr. Allin accused Darcy of being ungenerous and heartless, which led to a series of public slanderous letters being exchanged between the two men. The case ended in 1811 with an out-of-court settlement.

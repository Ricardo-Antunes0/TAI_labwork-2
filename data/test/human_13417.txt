"Graduate" is a song by American rock band Third Eye Blind from their eponymous debut studio album (1997). It was released to radio as the second single from the album in August, 1997, by Elektra Records. Frontman Stephan Jenkins and guitarist Kevin Cadogan are credited as co-writers on the song. Production on the song was helmed by Jenkins and Eric Valentine. According to Jenkins, the song is about the band's experience after being signed to a major record label. The song reached number 26 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the U.S, and number 14 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. Additionally, it was featured in the 1998 film Can't Hardly Wait starring Seth Green and Jennifer Love Hewitt. The band played the song at the 25th Annual American Music Awards, changing some of the lyrics to "can I masturbate" in place of "can I graduate." In 2011 former Third Eye Blind members Cadogan and Arion Salazar performed the song and made an unofficial video.

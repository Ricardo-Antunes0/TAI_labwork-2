Operation Linebacker II was an aerial bombing campaign waged by the United States against North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The name refers to the planned use of linebacker aircraft which were designed to approach and attack single targets rather than bombing fields and villages.  Operation Linebacker II began on 17 November 1972, when U.S. B-52 bombers attacked military targets in North Vietnam. The operation continued sporadically until 30 January 1973, when it was halted by a Communist offensive in South Vietnam. The bombing campaign had little impact on the course of the war, but it demonstrated the U.S. determination to continue the fight against North Vietnam.

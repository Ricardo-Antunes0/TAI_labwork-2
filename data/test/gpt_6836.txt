Britannia Secunda or Britannia II (Latin for "Second Britain") was the name given by Ptolemy to a hypothetical island in the Atlantic Ocean. The first mention of the island is in the 2nd century BC, when it was mentioned by Theophrastus as part of a discussion on the location of the world's extremities. The etymology of the name is unknown.  The only physical evidence for Britannia Secunda is a reference by Ptolemy to a group of islands which he claimed lay midway between Europe and Africa. These islands were most likely an extension of the Iberian Peninsula, and were named after the people living there â€“ the Britanni.  The existence of Britannia Secunda was first disproved by Edward Forbes in 1817, who showed that it could not be supported by geographical data. Later, in 1879, Alfred Russel Wallace provided further evidence that Britannia Secunda did not exist, based on his theory of evolution. Despite this, some people continue to believe in its existence, based on theories such as Ptolemy's geocentric model or Plato's theory of Forms.

The Drumtroddan standing stones  are a group of three megalithic standing stones located near the small town of Drumtroddan, in the county of Cavan, Ireland. The stones are thought to date from the Neolithic or Bronze Age and are currently the only known examples of their type in Ireland.  The stones are located on a grassy bank above the River Boyne, about a kilometre east of the village of Drumtroddan. The tallest of the stones is about 2.5 metres high and the others are around 1.5 metres high. They are made from sandstone and sit on a small mound of earth.  There is no known history or meaning behind the stones, although they are thought to have been built as a pagan shrine or monument. There is some debate over whether they were originally erected as part of a single structure or if they were simply placed along the riverbank at different times.

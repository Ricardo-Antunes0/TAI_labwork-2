The mustard oil bomb, formerly known as the carpet bombing, is a type of aerial bombing that uses a large quantity of mustard gas as the primary explosive and incendiary agent.  The development of the mustard oil bomb was spurred by the success of the gasoline-air mixture bomb during World War I. The first mustard oil bomb was dropped on German positions on 17 September 1917. The most famous use of a mustard oil bomb was by the United States against Tokyo in 1945.

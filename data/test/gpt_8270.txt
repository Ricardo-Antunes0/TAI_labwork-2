The Memphis Free Speech was an African-American civil rights demonstration held in Memphis, Tennessee on September 5, 1964. The event, which attracted national attention, was held to protest the city's policy of segregation and its enforcement by the Memphis Police Department.  The Memphis Free Speech is also notable for the violence and chaos that ensued as police attempted to disperse the crowd with tear gas and rubber bullets. In total, twelve people were killed, including five police officers, and more than fifty were injured. The event has been cited as a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement in America.

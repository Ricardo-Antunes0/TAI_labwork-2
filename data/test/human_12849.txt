She is best known as one of the first co-hosts on the ABC morning talk show The View, which she appeared on for nine seasons from 1997-98 through 2005-06. She was also one of sixteen contestants of the fourth installment of The Celebrity Apprentice in 2011, coming in fifth place.  On January 10, 2022, it was announced that longest running courtroom series, Divorce Court, would enter its milestone 40th season in fall 2022 with Jones, a former Brooklyn prosecutor and district attorney, as the show's next arbitrator. The move will be Jones's return to the court show genre having previously served as arbitrator over the 1994-95 series, Jones & Jury. The broadcast made Jones the first Black person to preside over her own court show and first female to preside over arbitration-based reality court shows in particular.

The New Hance Trail (a.k.a. Red Canyon Trail) is a hiking trail on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park, located in the U.S. state of Arizona. It is one of the "unmaintained" trails and, along with the similar Tanner Trail, is considered one of the most difficult trails on the South Rim.  Unlike the Tanner Trail, there is no parking available at the trailhead, which is located about a 5-minute walk north of the South Rim main road. The trail ends at the Hance Rapids on the Colorado River. It is approximately 6.5 hiking miles and a 4400' descent from the South Rim main road at ~7040' to the Colorado River at ~2600' elevation. This trail has become used more in recent years.  It is no longer only marked by the occasional cairn.  While it remains a very rugged trail, the New Hance is now a real single track trail that is very distinct and relatively straightforward to follow the entire way from the South Rim Drive down to the river.  Well-engineered switchbacks and other trail maintenance indicate that significant work, however irregularly, has been done on the trail over the years since John Hance first created the trail in the 1890s.

Polyphlebium venosum, the veined bristle-fern or bristle fern, is a fern found in eastern North America, from Newfoundland to Florida and west to Kansas. It grows in moist, acidic soils.  The leaves are broad and cordate, with prominent veins. The fronds are up to 80 cm long and 20 cm wide, and have a bluntly triangular shape. The fronds are dark green above and lighter below, with small bristles along the margins. The stipe is slender and 0.5-1 cm thick. The sporangia are borne on short stalks at the base of the fronds. They are round, with a diameter of about 1 mm, and are covered in small bristles.

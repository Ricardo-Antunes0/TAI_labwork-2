The Stag Inn is a public house in the Old Town area of Hastings, a port and seaside resort in East Sussex, England.  One of many ancient buildings on All Saints Street, the 16th-century timber-framed inn was refronted in the 18th century, but many of its original features remain.  The preserved bodies of two smoke-blackened mummified cats have been displayed on a wall since their discovery in the 19th century; witchcraft has been suggested as an explanation for this "grisly sight".  The inn, which claims to be Hastings' oldest surviving pub, is operated as a tied house by the Shepherd Neame Brewery, and has been listed at Grade II by English Heritage for its architectural and historical importance. History and description Hastings developed as a fishing port from the 10th century or earlier: its first documented reference in 928 indicates that it was already important locally, and it was soon the leader of the Cinque Ports.  Two streams ran into the English Channel between the East and West Hills, steep promontories which forced the town to develop inwards along the valley floor.  Two parallel roads, High Street and All Saints Street, ran up the valley and formed the heart of the Old Town area.  The oldest surviving buildings on All Saints Street, named after the ancient parish church at the north end, are 15th-century.

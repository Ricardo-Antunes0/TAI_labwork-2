"Thanksgiving Orphans" is the ninth episode of the fifth season of the American television sitcom Cheers, co-written by Cheri Eichen and Bill Steinkeller and directed by James Burrows. It aired originally on November 27, 1986, on NBC. The characters do not have families or friends to spend time with, and some of their plans backfire. They gather for a Thanksgiving feast which degenerates into a food fight. Burrows filmed the food-fight scene (which was only partially choreographed) twice. The episode had a generally positive reception. TV Guide ranked it number seven on its 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time list while The Huffington Post included the food fight sequence in a list of the 10 Most Awkward Thanksgiving Scenes of All Time from movies and television. Plot At Thanksgiving, Sam (Ted Danson) has plans with his girlfriend Wendy. Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) is lonely, and wants some company.

Carla's children are with her ex-husband, Nick. At Diane's insistence, Carla (Rhea Perlman) invites the gang for a Thanksgiving potluck. However, Diane (Shelley Long) has been invited to her American literature professor's annual Thanksgiving party where she hopes to meet William Styron.

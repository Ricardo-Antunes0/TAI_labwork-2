Crab soccer (American English and Australian English), also known as crab football, is a sport in which teams of crabs play against each other in a tournament or championship. The game is played with a ball made from a piece of bread or biscuit and is similar to soccer, but the ball is smaller and is kicked with the feet rather than with the hands.  The game originated in the United States in the early 20th century, and has been played in various countries around the world. It is now popular in Australia and American Samoa, where it is considered a national sport.  Crab soccer is usually played on a beach or in a large body of water. The game consists of two halves of 15 minutes each, with a five-minute half-time break. The object of the game is to score goals by kicking the ball into the opponent's net. There are three players on each team, who stand opposite each other on either side of the goal. A player who has possession of the ball can use any part of his body to kick the ball, but he must kick it with his feet.

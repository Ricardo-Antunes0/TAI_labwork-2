Shine: The Hits is the first compilation album by Christian pop rock group Newsboys. It was released in 2000, spanning recordings from 1988 to 1998 (songs from 1999's Love Liberty Disco, their latest studio album at the time, were left off the collection). Exclusive to the set were three new songs ("Joy", "Who?", and "Praises"), an update of their 1996 hit "God Is Not a Secret", featuring dc Talk's TobyMac, a remix of their hit "Shine", and an eight-minute "Mega-Mix" of several of their biggest hits. Also included is an extended version of "I'm Not Ashamed", which differs from the original album version. Missing hits Due to the large quantity of hit radio singles the Newsboys had–forty-one of their songs had become listed hits on at least one of CCM's Christian music charts (including the CHR, Rock, Adult Contemporary, and Inspirational formats) by the time Shine: The Hits was being compiled–many bona-fide hits were left off of the album. Number One songs on the Christian CHR charts that were excluded from the set were: "One Heart", "Real Good Thing", "Truth and Consequences", "Let It Go", "Beautiful Sound", and "Good Stuff". Other top ten singles from the CHR charts that were left off of the track listing were: "Stay with Me", "Upon This Rock", "Be Still" (which was also their only top ten hit on the Christian Inspirational chart), "Let It Rain", "Breathe (Benediction)", "It's All Who You Know", "Shine 2000 (Remix)", and "Love Liberty Disco". Top ten hits from the Christian Adult Contemporary charts that were absent from the collection were: "Love", "Let It Go" (also a CHR No. 1 hit), and "Beautiful Sound" (also a CHR No. 1).  Number One songs from the Christian Rock charts excluded were "Cup O' Tea" and "Breathe", while other top ten songs from that chart missing were "In the End", "Lights Out", "Lost the Plot", and "Hallelujah".

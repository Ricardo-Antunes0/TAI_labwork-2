The Technology Innovation Agency  (TIA) ANSI/TIA-942-A Telecommunications Infrastructure Standard for Data Centers is an American National Standard (ANS) that specifies the minimum requirements for structured cabling work defined in TIA/EIA-568, and is often cited by companies such as ADC Telecommunications and Cisco Systems. The standard was updated with an addendum ANSI/TIA-942-A-1 in April 2013 from the TR-42.1 The Telecommunications Industry Association does not offer certification programs or certify compliance to TIA standards.  In many cases, there are other organizations and consultants that can provide those services. However, TIA does not certify these organizations or consultants. This is similar to how organizations like ISO operate where they rely on Certification Bodies to ensure that there is oversight over organizations performing such activities. On October 15, 2015, the TIA TR-42.1 Subcommittee voted to start the revision process of ANSI/TIA-942-A. The standard will undergo updates during 2016. The new version of ANSI/TIA-942 which will be labelled as ANSI/TIA-942-B has been released in July 2017.

Organic certification is a certification process for products that meet specific organic production standards. The standards vary by country, but often include requirements for soil quality, water use, and animal welfare.  Organic products can be distinguished from their conventional counterparts by their use of renewable resources, such as organic farming methods that use no synthetic pesticides or fertilizers. They are also typically less processed, and may have a longer shelf life.  Organic certification has become an important tool for consumers and retailers to differentiate between organic and non-organic products. In some countries, organic products account for a significant share of the food market.  The global market for organic products was estimated at US$22.4 billion in 2016, and is forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of 7.9% over the next five years.

Cross River Rail is an underground railway project through central Brisbane, which is, , under construction. Cross River Rail will see the development of a new rail line underneath Brisbane River, and the redevelopment of a number of stations in the Brisbane central business district. The business case for the project was released in August 2017, with work officially beginning in September. The project replaces the planned 2013 BaT Tunnel, which in turn had replaced the original 2010 Cross River Rail proposal. A second rail crossing is required after 2021 when Brisbaneâ€™s only inner-city rail river crossing, the Merivale Bridge, is expected to reach maximum capacity. The project includes just under six kilometres of rail tunnel, four new underground inner city stations and an upgrade to the existing Exhibition station.  Cross River Rail is considered to be the highest infrastructure priority by the Queensland Government. Infrastructure Australia evaluated the business case in 2017 and expressed concerns that the rail patronage projections may not be achieved, the benefits in the business case are overstated and that the cost benefit ratio is likely to be less than one.

History European-Americans started calling their first community "Hole's Station" circa 1797, when Zechariah Hole settled there with his family from Virginia and built a stockade on the west bank of the Miami River opposite the mouth of Bear Creek. The stockade attracted squatters, surveying parties, and other settlers who had taken grants to live in the local cabins until they could build their own; hence the little community became known as "Hole's Station". Settlers came west primarily from Pennsylvania. By 1822, the unincorporated community had become a village; it achieved city status in the 1920s.

Henry Harris (c. 1634 â€“ 1704) was an English actor who was active in the Restoration and early Georgian eras. He is perhaps best known for his roles in the plays of William Shakespeare.  Harris was born in about 1634, probably in London. He began his career as an actor in the early Restoration era, appearing in a range of plays, including The Merry Wives of Windsor and A Midsummer Night's Dream. He became particularly associated with Shakespeare, playing roles in such plays as As You Like It, Twelfth Night, Measure for Measure, and Macbeth. Harris retired from the stage around 1690. He died around 1704.

Epsilon Sagittarii (Latinised from ε Sagittarii, abbreviated Epsilon Sgr, ε Sagittarii), also known as Spica, is a binary star system in the southern constellation of Sagittarius. The brighter component, Epsilon Sagittarii A, has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.7 and is about 130 light-years from Earth. The fainter component, Epsilon Sagittarii B, has an apparent visual magnitude of 4.1 and is about 130 light-years from Earth.  The primary star, Epsilon Sagittarii A is about 120 times the mass of the Sun and has a radius about 120 times that of the Sun. It is radiating more than 430 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,500 K. Epsilon Sagittarii B is about the mass of the Sun and has aradius about 9 times that of the Sun. It is radiating only about 3% as much energy as its primary from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5,000 K.  Epsilon Sagittarii was first discovered by German astronomer Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve on December 21, 1784.

Borderline hydrides typically refer to hydrides formed of hydrogen and elements of the periodic table in group 11 and group 12 and indium (In) and thallium (Tl).  These compounds have properties intermediate between covalent hydrides and saline hydrides.  Hydrides are chemical compounds that contain a metal and hydrogen acting as a negative ion. Properties Borderline hydrides exhibit bonding characteristics between ionic and covalent bond types. A specific examples of a borderline hydride CuH, copper hydride,  that appears as a spongy reddish-brown substance is a moderate reducing agent. It will catalytically oxidize hypophosphorous acid to phosphorous acid at room temperature, and it gives off hydrogen gas when subjected to heat. ZnH2 is also a solid at room temperature that breaks down at 90 °C, but even left alone decomposes over several days to zinc metal and hydrogen gas. Hydrogen telluride (H2Te) and hydrogen selenide (H2Se) are both borderline hydrides of high volatility that produce strong, unpleasant odors.

Fjære Church   is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Grimstad Municipality in Agder county, Norway. It is located in the village of Fjære. It is the main church for the Fjære parish which is part of the Vest-Nedenes prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark. The white, stone church was built in a long church design around the year 1150 using plans drawn up by an unknown architect. The church seats about 300 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1320, but the church was not new that year. The first church at Fjære was likely a wooden church with a stone altar. That church was taken down at some point an replaced with the present church, likely around the year 1150, but the old stone altar from the old church was left in place and a new stone church was constructed on the same site surrounding the existing altar. The new church had a  rectangular nave with an  rectangular choir on the east end. There was a semi-circular apse built on the eastern end of the choir as well. The church was constructed with a basement crypt underneath it. (The crypt contains 26 bodies, mainly important people from the community during the 17th century. The basement was formally closed to visitors in 1997 to give respect to the dead.)

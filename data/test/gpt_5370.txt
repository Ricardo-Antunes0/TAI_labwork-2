Herman James Good, VC (29 November 1887 â€“ 9 November 1916) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to a member of the British or Commonwealth forces.  Good was born in Newport, New South Wales on 29 November 1887. He enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 2 July 1915, and was posted to the 3rd Battalion, Australian Infantry Regiment (3 AIR), which was then serving in Egypt. On 9 November 1916, during the Battle of Pozieres, near Arras, France, Good single-handedly attacked and captured a German machine-gun post which had been inflicting heavy casualties on his battalion. For this action he was awarded the Victoria Cross. However, just days later he was killed in action while leading a charge on a second machine-gun post. He was aged just 25 years old.  Good is buried at Helles Memorial Cemetery, Gallipoli, Turkey. His grave can be found in Plot I, Row A, Grave 6.

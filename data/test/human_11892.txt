John Kiley (November 1, 1912 â€“ July 15, 1993) was the organist at Braves Field from 1948 to 1952, Fenway Park from 1953 to 1989 and at the Boston Garden from 1941 to 1984. He is credited with having discovered the Boston Garden's resident singer Rene Rancourt. Kiley was a veteran movie theater organist from the silent film era. In the early 50s he recorded a number of songs on the then Boston Music Hall Wurlitzer pipe organ (4 manuals, 22 ranks).  These were originally released on the budget Spin-O-Rama label under the title "The Majesty of the Big Pipe Organ" however, soon after the first release the same tracks ("Poor Johnny One Note,"  "Tell Me Pretty Maiden," "Roamin' in the Gloamin'," "Dark Eyes," "O Promise Me," among others) began appearing on releases on other budget record labels under different pseudonyms ("William Daly," "John Minger," "Ralph Kramer," "Don Ayers," "George Ryan," etc.)

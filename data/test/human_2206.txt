Folkebevegelsen mot innvandring (FMI) or "People's Movement Against Immigration" is an organisation that works against immigration, based in Norway. The organisation was founded in 1987, and was initially led by Arne Myrdal who was later squeezed out due to his escalating and uncontrollable violent activism. FMI also enjoyed the support of convicted old-school Nazis like Henrik Bastian Heide from Norsk Front and was therefore disputed to be anything else than a racist trampoline organization. The FMI sees itself as a nonpartisan interest organisation that works to "stop the foreign cultural mass immigration to Norway." According to their own political program, they seek to inform the public, political parties and politicians about the consequences of the mass immigration. The FMI were especially active in the late 1980s and early 1990s, gaining support of the national EU-resistance,  but later, its activities and membership has been limited. In neighbouring Denmark, the FMI is closely affiliated with Den Danske Forening. There they got 161 votes in a municipal election among 100 982 voters in 2005. Background The FMI was founded in 1987, presumably in response to a further liberalisation of the Norwegian immigration policy earlier the same year. The organisation wanted to enforce the de jure "immigration stop" that was adopted by the Norwegian Parliament in 1975, but which never went into practical force. The prelude to the creation to the FMI was a letter signed by 145 Norwegian resistance veterans from the Second World War, which was sent to King Olav V of Norway. In it, they expressed their concern and regret that their fight for Norway's freedom would go to waste due to an immigration policy which would lead to "tragic consequences" for Norway as a nation-state. But source for this claim is missing.

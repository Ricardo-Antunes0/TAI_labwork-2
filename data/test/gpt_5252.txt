In adaptive optics, the Greenwood frequency  is a name given to the frequency of the lowest order mode of vibration of the medium used in adaptive optics. The term was first introduced by Professor A. M. Greenwood in 1964.  The Greenwood frequency is important in adaptive optics because it determines the amount of turbulence that can be tolerated in the medium. The lower the Greenwood frequency, the more turbulence can be tolerated before image quality starts to deteriorate.

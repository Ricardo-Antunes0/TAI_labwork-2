Potomac was originally inhabited by peoples of the Piscataway Indian Nation and formed part of their homeland until 1754 when George Washington acquired a large tract of land from the Piscataways. He named his new estate Mount Vernon after his family home in England. In 1781, General Anthony Wayne led a successful attack on Washington's fortified home, which became known as "The Battle of Bunker Hill." The area remained largely rural until the early 20th century when it began to develop as a suburb of Washington D.C.  In 1924, Potomac incorporated as a city and began to grow rapidly due to its proximity to downtown D.C. and its excellent public schools. In 1961, Potomac became a charter member of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), which helped guide its growth into an affluent community with a diversity of cultures and incomes. Today, Potomac is one of the most diverse communities in Montgomery

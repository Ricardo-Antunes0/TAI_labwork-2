History The naming of the township was for one of the seven monks who followed the body of St Cuthbert from Lindisfarne to Durham. Spellings of this name Reingwald have included Reynington, Reynoton, Reynton, and Rayntona. The area belonged to the Prior and convent of Durham and was densely wooded, a park keeper being recorded as appointed in 1338.  In 1657 Richard Marshall assigned a tenement and farm holding in West Rainton to Marmaduke Allenson. It then passed into the hands of West Rainton's more famous son – Sir John Duck, 1st Baronet – a Dick Whittington of the North East of England. He owned and built Rainton Hall around the year 1688.

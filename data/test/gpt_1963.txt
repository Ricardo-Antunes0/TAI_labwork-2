Lysogeny, or the lysogenic cycle, is one of the basic reproductive mechanisms in prokaryotes. In a lysogenic cycle, a prokaryotic cell acquires the ability to survive and reproduce within another prokaryotic cell, without reproducing itself.  Lysogenic cycles were first discovered in the late 1800s by August Weismann. He observed that certain bacteria can develop within the cells of other bacteria, without causing any harm to either organism. This process is known as lysogeny, and it allows these bacteria to pass on their genetic information without ever becoming fully active.  Lysogenic cycles are often used by bacteria to transfer genes from one species to another. This process is known as transduction, and it is often used to transfer genes between different strains of the same species. Lysogenic cycles are also used by some viruses to reproduce themselves.

In computer programming, a parameter or a parameter block is a data structure used to pass information between functions. Parameters are particularly common in procedural programming languages, where they are used to pass local variables to a function or procedure. Parameter passing can also be done using arguments in an imperative programming language. In object-oriented programming, parameters may be passed as instance variables to a method.  Parameters can also be used for data binding in graphical user interfaces, for example when a control has a property that takes a value of type "DataObject" and the user wants to bind this property to a textbox control.

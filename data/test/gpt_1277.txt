Pomadasys macracanthus, the longspined grunt or Mexican longspine squid, is a species of cephalopod in the family Janthinidae. It is found in the eastern Pacific Ocean.  Pomadasys macracanthus is a large and impressive cephalopod, reaching up to 2.5 m in mantle length and weighing up to 50 kg. It has a long, flexible body with a large head and eyes distributed along the sides of its mantle. The arms and tentacles are long and thin, and are covered in small spines. The coloration varies somewhat between individuals, but is generally brown or black with large white patches on the mantle and arms, and a variety of smaller white spots on the tentacles. The longspine squid is unique among cephalopods in that it possesses a pair of spines on its penis which can be used to impale other animals.

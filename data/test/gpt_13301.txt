The collared sparrowhawk (Accipiter cirrocephalus) is a species of hawk in the family Accipitridae. The collared sparrowhawk is found in Central and South America, from Panama to Peru.  The collared sparrowhawk is a medium-sized hawk, with a length of 43 to 53 cm and a wingspan of 122 to 137 cm. The plumage is mostly dark brown, with a white collar and broad black band around the neck. The underparts are whitish or straw-coloured, and the tail is dark brown with a broad white band. The sexes are similar, but juveniles have more yellow on the head and neck.  The collared sparrowhawk feeds on small prey, mainly birds and rodents, but it will also take carrion. It nests in a hole in a tree or cliff, laying two to four eggs.

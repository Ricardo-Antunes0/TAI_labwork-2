The Charter of Povlja  is a document that was signed on the island of Povlja in 1202 by the Serb King Stefan Nemanja and the Bulgarian Emperor Kaloyan. The charter recognised the sovereignty of the Republic of Venice over the island.  The charter is significant because it is one of the first documents to establish formal relations between Venice and Serbia, and it is also one of the earliest examples of a written document that uses both Cyrillic and Latin script.

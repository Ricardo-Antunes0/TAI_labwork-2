The Statesman (, Politik√≥s; Latin: Politicus), also known as the Dialogue of Plato, is a philosophical dialogue by Plato. It principally consists of Socrates and the politician Alcibiades.  The dialogue was written circa 380 BC, although some passages may be older. It takes the form of a conversation between Socrates and Alcibiades, in which Socrates tries to educate Alcibiades on the nature of justice, virtue, and politics. The Statesman was first published in book form in 1787 by Lord Kames.  The Statesman has been interpreted in many ways, but is generally seen as a critique of democracy. Plato portrays democracy as being led by people who are not qualified to rule, and Alcibiades as being swayed by personal desires instead of thinking about the best interests of Athens.

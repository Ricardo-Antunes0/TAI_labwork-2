Brahmaloka (Sanskrit: ब्रह्मालोक, IAST: Brahmāloka), is the highest of the seven heavens in Hinduism, where the highest form of Brahman resides.  According to Jain texts, Brahmaloka is the abode of all jivas (living beings). It is said that once every thousand years, on the day of Mahavir Jayanti, all the jivas in Brahmaloka come down to earth to be reborn.  Brahmaloka is also known as "the world of gods". It is located in the middle of the universe, and is surrounded by seven other heavens. Each of these heavens is ruled by a different god or goddess.  The highest heaven, Brahmāloka, is home to the god Brahma. Other gods and goddesses who live in Brahmāloka include Vishnu, Shiva, Parvati, Saraswati, Lakshmi and Durga.   Brahmaloka is also home to a river of milk and a tree with fruits that never spoils. The tree is said to be the tree of life.

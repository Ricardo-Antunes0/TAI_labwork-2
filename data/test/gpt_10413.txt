The 1945 Hazara Rebellion was a rebellion fought by the Hazara people of Balochistan, Pakistan against the British Raj. Led by Bacha Khan, the rebellion was successful in uniting most of the Hazara region under a single rebel government. However, it was eventually crushed by the British and their Muslim allies. The rebellion has been seen as a seminal event in the development of modern Hazara nationalism.

In mathematics, Hilbert spaces (named for David Hilbert) are a general class of spaces that arise in many fields of mathematics. They are named after David Hilbert, who first introduced the concept in 1879.  A Hilbert space is a vector space equipped with a norm and a metric. It is usually denoted by the symbol H or ℝ, and is often described by specifying its dimension (usually 2 or 3). A function from H to H is said to be continuous if there exists a smooth curve that preserves the function's distance between points. A function from H to ℝ is said to be injective if for every two points in H, there exists a unique linear map from them to itself that is injective. A function from H to ℝ is said to be surjective if for every two points in H, there exists a unique linear map from them that is surjective.  A subset of H is called an open set if there exists a surjective mapping from it to ℝ that is not constant. Every open set contains at least one point, and every point in an open set is contained in some open set containing it. Every subset of H has an open subset containing it.

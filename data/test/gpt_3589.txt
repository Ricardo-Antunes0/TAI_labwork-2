Shery (or Sheri) is the name of a small town in Upper Egypt, located south of Cairo. Shery is known for its wine and olive oil production.  Sherry is located in the governorate of Menia and has a population of approximately 10,000. The town is located at an elevation of about 1,000 meters. Shery is noted for its olive oil and wine production, which has been commercially successful since the 19th century. The town also has a textiles industry.  Sherry was first settled in the 13th century by the Mamluks, who named it after their queen Sheriya. The town became a center of wine production during the Ottoman period, when it was known as "Sheriyye". Shery was seized by British forces during the campaign to capture Cairo in 1882, and became part of the British protectorate of Egypt.  The town was badly damaged during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, which left it largely abandoned. In 2016, a Chinese company announced plans to invest $1 billion in Shery over the next five years to revive its economy.

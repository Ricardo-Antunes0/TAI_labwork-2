KidZui was a web browser designed for children. It was a fork of the Mozilla Firefox web browser and was aimed at children aged 6 to 12. KidZui had a simplified interface, child-safe web browsing features, and parental controls.  KidZui was created in early 2012 by two developers, Mark Pilgrim and Stefan Weitz. The browser was initially released as open source software and had a community of supporters. However, in November 2013, the developers announced that they were no longer working on the project.  KidZui had several features that made it different from other web browsers for children. These included a simplified interface, child-safe web browsing features, and parental controls. Some of these features were based on technology that had been developed by the developers for their own use. For example, the simplified interface allowed children to access websites without having to learn how to use a mouse or keyboard. The browser also had features designed to protect children from online dangers. These included blocking adult websites and cookies, and preventing children from sharing their passwords with others.

The dubious dtella, native Australian house gecko, or dubious four-clawed gecko (Gehyra dubia) is a species of gecko in the genus Gehyra, native to Northeastern Australia (Queensland and northern New South Wales as well as islands of the Great Barrier Reef and the Torres Strait). The lizard is found in a variety of habitats, including acacia and eucalyptus woodlands, and in human-developed habitats, such as house walls in urban areas. Its urban presence makes it known as a common house gecko in Queensland. These geckos are often confused with the Asian common house gecko, which was introduced to Australia, but G. dubia has distinct rounded feet  and less louder calls. Physical Description  Gehyra dubia is a small gecko; its snout-to-vent length ranges up to 6 cm, and its tail length ranging up to 14 cm. Body size does not vary significantly between the sexes. While resting, they are typically a dull gray-brown color and carry dark spots all over the dorsal side. It has a slight camouflage ability, and often changes to a lighter brown. When foraging, they lose the spots on their back. These geckos have four limbs, each complete with five digits. Each digit is situated on a circular pad, which helps them grip surfaces. This contributes to their ability to succeed in a human house as a habitat; they can grip onto ceilings and glass windows. Interestingly, G. dubia lacks a claw on its inner digits. The skin on the gecko, even its tail, is smooth. This is one of the distinctions between Gehyra dubia and other Australian gecko species. These geckos also lack eyelids and have vertical eyes like most other gecko species. Therefore, they lick their eyes with their tongues rather than blinking in order to clean them. A nocturnal advantage is that their big eyes are about 350 more sensitive than human eyes in the dark. When in periods of stress such as a predator chase, the dubious dtella can lose its tail as a mechanism for feigning injury.

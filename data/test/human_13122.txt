Genome mining describes the exploitation of genomic information for the discovery of biosynthetic pathways of natural products and their possible interactions. It depends on computational technology and bioinformatics tools. The mining process relies on a huge amount of data (represented by DNA sequences and annotations) accessible in genomic databases. By applying data mining algorithms,  the data can be used to generate new knowledge in several areas of medicinal chemistry, such as discovering novel natural products. History  In the mid- to late 1980s, researchers have increasingly focused on genetic studies with the advancing sequencing technologies. The GenBank database was established in 1982 for the collection, management, storage, and distribution of DNA sequence data due to the increasing availability of DNA sequences. With the increasing number of genetic data, biotechnological companies have been able to use human DNA sequence to develop protein and antibody drugs through genome mining since 1992. In the late 1990s, many companies, such as Amgen, Immunec, Genentech were able to develop drugs that progressed to the clinical stage by adopting genome mining. Since the Human Genome Project was completed in the early 2000, researchers have been sequencing the genomes of many microorganisms. Subsequently, many of these genomes have been carefully studied to identify new genes and biosynthetic pathways.

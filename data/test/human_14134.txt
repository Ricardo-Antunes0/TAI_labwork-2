John James Teeling (born January 1946) is an Irish academic and businessperson, notable for the wide range of businesses he has developed or overhauled over several decades.  In particular, he broke the Irish Distillers monopoly which existed in the Irish whiskey industry, by launching the Cooley Distillery, and reopened the 1757-founded Kilbeggan Distillery after a 50-year hiatus. He is also notable for having brought ten companies to public listing on the London Stock Exchange, the most of any Irish person.  Teeling lectured at University College Dublin's business school for over 20 years.  He authored a number of educational texts, for primary school and college. Early life and education John James Teeling was born in January 1946, the eldest of the four children of James "Jimmy" B. Teeling (died 1960) and Emma "Emily" Teeling (n√©e Kinsella, died 2005) of Hollybrook Road, Clontarf, an affluent northern suburb of Dublin, where he grew up. His father was a Royal Liver Assurance agent, and Teeling has said that his family were neither rich nor poor, but were the first on their street to buy a television and a car.  His father also ran a small legal money-lending business, and John Teeling helped with this from the age of 12.  With his father dying suddenly at home when John was 14, his mother assumed management of the money-lending business, with John taking certain responsibilities within it while also working as a van boy for 1.50 pounds a week, and completing school at St Joseph's CBS, Fairview.

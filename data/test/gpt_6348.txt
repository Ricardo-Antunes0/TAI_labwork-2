An arrow is a graphical symbol, such as  a vertical line with a pointed end at one end and a blunt end at the other, that is used to indicate directionality or movement. Arrows are often used in maps to indicate directions and distances. Arrows are also used in medical diagrams and other diagrams to indicate the movement of organs or other body parts.

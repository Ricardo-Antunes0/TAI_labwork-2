Fair Albion - Visions of England, is an online exhibition of paintings and drawings by English artist, John Constable. The exhibition, which runs from 17 October 2014 to 24 February 2015, is the inaugural exhibition of the National Gallery's new London branch.  Fair Albion is inspired by Constable's abiding love of his native England and its landscape, which he captured in his paintings and drawings between 1802 and 1827. The exhibition includes works from the National Gallery's own collection as well as loans from major museums around the world.   Constable's paintings and drawings are characterised by their luminous skies, strong colours and depictions of rural landscapes, towns and villages. They are highly atmospheric and often show figures in motion - a reflection of Constable's lifelong fascination with movement and the changing seasons.

The Eagle Mine is a small, high-grade nickel mining and copper mining project owned by Lundin Mining. The mine is located on the Yellow Dog Plains in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the United States. Eagle is the only primary nickel mining project in the United States. The mine began production in fall 2014 and is expected to produce 360 million pounds of nickel, 295 million pounds of copper and small amounts of other metals (platinum, palladium, silver, gold, and cobalt) over its eight-year mine life. Overview Eagle is a decline-accessed underground mine, primarily utilizing long hole stoping for production. Interest in the project both locally and statewide had increased due to the submission of a mining permit application for the project. The project has garnered local opposition as well as support. The opposition groups claim that the mine will produce environmental damage, while supporters and the company claim the mine will protect the environment while producing much-needed jobs.

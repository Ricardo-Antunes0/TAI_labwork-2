Fuzzbubble was a 1990s rock/power pop band from Chicago, Illinois.  Formed in 1990, Fuzzbubble was one of the first bands to emerge from the Chicago music scene in the early 1990s. The group was composed of singer/guitarist Matt Schoenfeld, drummer Andy Kiersz, bassist Tim Green and keyboardist Greg Dulkin.  The band released two albums, "Fuzzbubble" and "Go!", before disbanding in 1999. However, Schoenfeld and Kiersz reunited in 2006 to release an album as the Matt Schoenfeld Band.

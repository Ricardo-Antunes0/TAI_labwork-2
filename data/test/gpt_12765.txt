The Terrain Gallery, or the Terrain, is a large and elaborate landscape painting by the Dutch artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Completed in 1565, it is located in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.  The work is a composition of more than sixteen panels, painted on both sides of the canvas. It presents a wide and varied view of the countryside, from a height of about 2.5 meters above the ground. The panels are divided into five sections: on the right side, we see fields and villages; in the middle, we see a river and mountains; on the left side, we see forests and meadows.  The Terrain has been called "one of the most important paintings of its era" and "one of the most original and beautiful works of art ever created".

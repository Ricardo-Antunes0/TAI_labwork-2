The 2014 Tamil film Lingaa, despite being one of the highest-grossing Tamil films of the year, was considered a box-office bomb due to the high production and distribution costs involved. The distributors faced huge losses and asked for their money back, with few of them submitted petitions to go on a hunger strike to protest against the losses incurred. Many of them claimed that the film had incurred only 30 percent of the down payment after 25 days of its release. Rajinikanth later refunded one-third of the  loss reportedly incurred by distributors and exhibitors. He decided to pay them  'on a humanitarian basis', who demanded a full refund and had threatened a "begging protest" in front of the actor's residence. Overview  According to R. Singaravelan, who acquired the distribution rights of the film in Trichy and Thanjavur areas stated about the film's losses in an online interview on 19 December 2014. He added that the film failed to collect 20% of their investments during the first week of its release, further citing that the excessive hype for the film led to higher prices for distribution rights. He also condemned the makers' decision to release the film on actor Rajinikanth's birthday (12 December 2014), due to the ongoing half-yearly examinations in schools. Few industry sources revealed that Rajinikanth's compulsion to do Lingaa is because of the failure of Kochadaiiyaan, which resulted in a police case filed against his wife Latha Rajinikanth accusing for financial fraud. Vijayabhargavi Entertainers stated that they suffered losses in Chengalpet region. Capricorn Pictures incurred losses in North Arcot and South Arcot (Cuddalore-Villupuram) circles. Sukra Films and Chandrakala Movies lost money in Coimbatore and Tirunelveli-Tuticorin respectively. The distributors claimed Lingaa recovered only 30 percent of the down payment after 25 days of its release.

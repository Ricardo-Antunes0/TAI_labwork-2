A geologic hazard or geohazard is an unforeseen event that can cause damage to people or property. Geological hazards can be the result of natural processes (such as earthquakes or landslides) or human activity (such as mining, quarrying, and construction).  The most common types of geologic hazards are natural events (such as earthquakes or landslides), human activities (such as mining, quarrying, and construction), and nuclear accidents.  Natural events that can cause geologic hazards include earthquakes, floods, and volcanoes. Human activities that can cause geologic hazards include mining, quarrying, and construction. Nuclear accidents can also cause geologic hazards.  Geologic hazards can lead to damage to people or property. The most common types of damage caused by geologic hazards are injuries and deaths. Other types of damage include loss of property, economic losses, and environmental damage.  There is no one single solution for dealing with geologic hazards. Various methods including mitigation (preventing the hazard from occurring in the first place), response (responding to the hazard once it has occurred), and recovery (repairing the damage caused by the hazard) are used depending on the type of hazard.

A capital gains tax (CGT) is a tax on the increase in the value of assets, including land and property. The rate of CGT is generally higher than the ordinary tax rates, and is imposed on profits made from the sale or disposal of assets.  CGT was first introduced in Britain in 1694 as a tax on real estate transactions. The modern system of CGT was first introduced in Canada in 1936, and has since been adopted by many other countries. CGT is one of the main sources of government revenue in many countries. In 2012, CGT raised around $1 trillion globally.

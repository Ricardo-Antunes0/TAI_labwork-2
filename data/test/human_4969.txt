On 30 December 1997, gunmen belonging to National Democratic Front of Bodoland gunned down 12 Bengali Hindus in the outskirts of Nislamari in Darrang district (now in Udalguri district). The dead included a six-month-old baby and six women. On the next day the group attacked another village nearby and killed 9 Bengalis. Background  Following non-implementation of the 1993 Bodo Accord, the erstwhile Bodo Security Force transformed itself into National Democratic Front of Bodoland with the stated goal of secession from India and the formation of a sovereign Bodoland. The Christian dominated NDFB targeted the minority ethnic groups in the Bodo inhabited areas. NDFB also violently clashed for supremacy with the Hindu-dominated the Bodo Liberation Tigers Force that espoused the formation of a Bodo autonomous region within Assam. In this violent battle for supremacy the Bodo Liberation Tigers Force aligned with the Bengali Liberation Tigers for the protection of the Bengali Hindu people from the NDFB attacks. On 30 December 1997, the massacre took place in the outskirts of Nislamari (also spelled Nichlamari) about the 28 kilometers from Tangla in Darrang district (now in Udalguri district). According to Assam police the NDFB insurgents were targeting Bengali Liberation Tigers cadres in the area.

Crescentine, crescente or tigelle (sing: crescentina, crescenta or tigelle) is a type of pasta, originating in Modena, Emilia-Romagna, Italy. It is a tube-shaped dough consisting of egg yolk, water and flour, which is then rolled out and cut into strips. It is then boiled in salted water until al dente.  The name crescentina derives from the shape of the pasta which resembles a crescent moon.   Crescentine is usually served with meat or fish sauce.

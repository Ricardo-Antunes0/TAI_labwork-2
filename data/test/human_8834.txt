Ora Belle Washington (c. 1899 â€“ December 21, 1971) was an American athlete from the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Washington was inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009. Early life Ora Washington was born in Virginia around 1899 to James Thomas Washington and Laura Young Washington. The exact date of her birth is unknown; after the American Civil War, the state of Virginia was in debt and to save money did not issue birth certificates from 1896 to 1912. The fifth of nine children, she grew up in the farming community of File located in Caroline County, Virginia. Despite owning their own farm, a better position than sharecropping, the economy was poor. In 1908, Laura Washington died in childbirth adding further strain to the family's finances, and by 1910 the family farm had been mortgaged and James Washington had been unemployed for a number of months. Like other African Americans during the great migration, the Washingtons moved north in the mid 1910s looking for better economic opportunities.

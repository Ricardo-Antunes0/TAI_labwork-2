Typhoon Nelson, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yolanda, was a powerful Category 5 typhoon that struck the Philippines in September 1982. The storm caused widespread damage, killing more than 2,000 people and resulting in a $2.2 billion dollar (Â£1.5 billion) damage bill.  Nelson originated from a tropical depression that formed on September 2 near the southern tip of Borneo. The system tracked west-northwestward and intensified into a tropical storm on September 5. Nelson reached its peak intensity as a Category 4 typhoon on September 8. The system then began to weaken due to increased wind shear and made landfall on the island of Samar on September 11 as a Category 3 typhoon. Nelson dissipated overland the next day.  Damage from Nelson was significant, with 2,136 fatalities and $2.2 billion in damage reported. In the Philippines, Nelson is most notably remembered for causing widespread destruction and loss of life, with an estimated 9 million people affected by the storm in total.

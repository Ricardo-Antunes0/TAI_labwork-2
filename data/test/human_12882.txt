Population: History Krasnogorodsk was founded in 1464 as Krasny Gorodets and was a fortress protecting Pskov from the southwest - one of the directions the Livonian Order was likely to advance from. In the beginning of the 15th century, together with Pskov, it was transferred to the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In 1581, Krasny Gorodets was conquered by the Polish Army and burned down. In 1607, it was again conquered by Lithuanians. In 1634 a peace between Russia and Poland was concluded, and the Krasny Gorodets was transferred to the Polishâ€“Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was returned to Russia under one of the provisions of the Truce of Andrusovo in 1667. By the end of the 19th century, the name of the settlement was Krasnogorodskoye and it was a part of Opochetsky Uyezd of Pskov Governorate.

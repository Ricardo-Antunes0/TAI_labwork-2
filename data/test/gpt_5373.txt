The Battle of Orbaizeta was fought from 26 October 1808 to 2 November 1808, during the Peninsular War. A French army under Marshal Thomas Graham attempted to break through Spanish lines and reach Madrid, while a Spanish army under General Jos√© de la Torre defended the city. The French were eventually successful in their attempt, but at the high cost of 6,000 casualties.

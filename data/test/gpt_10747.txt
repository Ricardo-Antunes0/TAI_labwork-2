Vote Leave is a campaigning organisation that seeks to leave the European Union. The organisation was founded in February 2016 by businessman and conservative commentator Arron Banks, entrepreneur Richard Tice and Labour Party donor Gina Miller.  Vote Leave has been criticised for its allegedly inaccurate research into the costs and benefits of the European Union, with Banks himself being fined by the Electoral Commission in December 2017 for making false claims about the cost of EU membership. The group has also been accused of using racist and xenophobic language in its campaigning.  Vote Leave has been endorsed by several high-profile Conservative Party members, including Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith, while Jemima Khan and Piers Morgan have both spoken out against Brexit.

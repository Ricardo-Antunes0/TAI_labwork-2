Sirmium was a city in the Roman province of Pannonia Secunda. It was the capital of the province from c. AD 140 to c. AD 305.  Sirmium was located on the Via Postumia, on the eastern bank of the Sava River, opposite the important Roman outpost of Carnuntum. It had a population of approximately 150,000 in the 4th century AD, when it was also one of the largest cities in the Pannonian plain. Sirmium was conquered by the Goths in 251 and by the Huns in 441, but recovered somewhat under Eastern Roman rule. In 896 it was captured by Hungarian troops led by Árpád, who founded an episcopal see there. In 1204 it passed under Hungarian rule again and became a provincial capital. In 1267–1453 it was the capital of the short-lived Kingdom of Hungary, and in 1526 it became part of the Ottoman Empire.  Sirmium ceased to be a residential center after 1453, when most of its inhabitants were dispersed throughout other parts of the Ottoman Empire or converted to Islam. The city lapsed into obscurity after World War I, when its historical monuments were plundered by Serbian forces during their occupation of Pannonia Secunda; only in 1968 did serious archaeological investigations begin that have since yielded important new insights into this period of Ottoman history. Today Sirmium is a museum and tourist attraction, and is located near modern-day Osij

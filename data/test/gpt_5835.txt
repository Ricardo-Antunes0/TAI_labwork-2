Stevens Creek is a creek in Santa Clara County, California. It originates from the Mt. Hamilton Range and flows through Saratoga and San Jose before emptying into the San Francisco Bay at the border of Emeryville and Oakland.  The creek is named for John Stevens, an early landowner in the area. The lower part of the creek runs through suburban areas, but the upper section runs through forested hillsides and has been designated a protected stream.  The creek is also known for its wide variety of aquatic life, including large populations of trout and steelhead trout. The creek has been used for recreation since the late 19th century, when it was known as a horse watering hole. Today, it is a popular destination for joggers and bicyclists.

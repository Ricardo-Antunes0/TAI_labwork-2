The Med are an ethnic community found in the coastal areas of Balochistan, Pakistan, mainly in the regions of Makran and Las Bela, and the Makran region of Sistan and Baluchestan Province of Iran. Origin  There are different theories as to the origin of the Med community. According to their own tribal traditions, the Med originate from Gandava in the Kacchi region of Balochistan. It is likely that the Med are one of the earliest settlers of the Makran coast or remnants of the historic Median people, and this is reinforced by the fact that the Med are mentioned in the chronicle of ancient Sindh, the Chachnama, as one of the tribes that inhabited coastal Balochistan. The Med speak Balochi which itself is one of the closest surviving relatives of the ancient Median language and the Med also consider themselves as Baloch. However, in both Makran and Las Bela, they are seen as a distinct tribe by both the Sindhi and Baloch. The Mohana tribe of Sindh and southern Punjab claim to be of Med origin.

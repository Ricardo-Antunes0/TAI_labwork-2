Feliciano (spelled Felizian in Germany) Ninguarda (1524-1592) was an Italian composer of the Renaissance. He was born in Brescia, and studied at the University of Bologna under Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. He was ordained a priest in 1550, but abandoned religious life in favour of a career in music. Ninguarda served as maestro di capella at the Basilica of San Petronio in Bologna from 1551 to 1568, and at the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella in Florence from 1568 to 1592. He is best known for his motets and madrigals, which show the influence of Palestrina.

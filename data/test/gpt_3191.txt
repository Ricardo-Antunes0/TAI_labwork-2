is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in Japan in 1994, and in North America and Europe the following year. The game is a sequel to the 1988 game Super Mario Bros., and its story follows the same characters as the original game while introducing a new cast of characters.  Super Metroid is set on a planet known as Zebes, which has been invaded by a parasitic life form called Metroids that have destroyed most of the planet's ecosystems. Samus Aran, a bounty hunter who has been sent to Zebes to destroy the Metroids, arrives on the planet and meets up with an old friend, Ridley, who leads her into the planet's surface to find the Metroid hatchling that has destroyed several planets. Once Samus finds the Metroid, she battles it and defeats it, saving Zebes from destruction.  Super Metroid received critical acclaim upon its release, with many reviewers praising its graphics, music, and gameplay. Its popularity led to its being re-released on several platforms over the years, including a Virtual Console release for the Wii in 2009.

The temple is located in the city of Ayutthaya, in the Ayutthaya Province.  The temple was originally built in the 13th century by King Ramkhamhaeng of Sukhothai Kingdom as a royal temple for his mother Queen Sri Savangwongse. King Ramkhamhaeng later added a number of ordination halls, libraries and other structures to the temple complex. The present-day Phra Malai Kham Luang complex comprises more than 30 structures, including two large gilded chedis (a type of Buddhist shrine), a vihara (monastic school), and a number of smaller temples.  The Phra Malai Kham Luang complex is also home to an extensive collection of Buddha images, including several that are over two centuries old. In addition, the temple grounds contain an extensive network of Buddhist shrines and meditation halls, making it a popular site for Buddhist pilgrims.

De Munitionibus Castrorum ("Concerning the fortifications of the Roman camp") is an early Latin work on military engineering, believed to have been written by the Roman engineer Marcus Vitruvius Pollio in the 1st century BC. The work covers a wide range of topics, from surveying and designing fortifications to artillery and naval warfare.  The treatise is divided into nine books, covering a variety of topics such as ditch and ramp construction, siege engines, and the construction of walls and ditches. In spite of its age, De Munitionibus Castrorum remains one of the most comprehensive sources on military engineering of its time.

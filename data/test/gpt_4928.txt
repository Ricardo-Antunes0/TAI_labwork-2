Via de Zenta, known simply as Zeta, is a route in the Julian Alps, located in north-eastern Italy. The route starts from the Austrian border town of Graz and traverses the Zeta and Tauro mountains, before ending at the Italian city of Trieste. Via de Zenta is one of the most popular hiking trails in the area and has been used by many hikers to reach the summit of Mount Triglav, the highest mountain in Slovenia and the third highest mountain in Europe.  Via de Zenta was first mentioned in a document from 1272, when it served as a connection between two feudal estates. In 1843, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria ordered a survey of the route to be made, as it was considered a potential means of accessing Trieste from Austria. The first section of the trail was opened to hikers in 1875, and it was upgraded to National Park status in 1978. Via de Zenta is classified as a "path of great natural importance" by the Italian Ministry of Environment and Forestry.

Benjamin Rush "Ben" Milam (October 20, 1788 â€“ November 22, 1859) was an American physician and statesman who was the first U.S. senator from the state of Louisiana.  Milam was born in Frederick County, Maryland, to a prominent family of planters. He studied medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and practiced in Philadelphia before moving to Louisiana in 1824. Milam soon became one of the wealthiest men in the state, and he served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1826 to 1830 and in the U.S. Senate from 1835 to 1859. He is best known for his role in pushing for the annexation of Texas by the United States, which occurred in 1845. Milam died in Washington, D.C., after a long illness.

Mail order is the buying of goods or services over the internet. It is a type of online commerce. The term mail order can refer to buying goods or services over the internet from a company that does not have a physical store, or from a retailer that sells only over the internet.  Mail order may also refer to buying goods or services from a company that has a physical store but does not sell over the internet, or from a retailer that does sell over the internet but only through their own website. It can also refer to buying goods or services from a company that has both a physical store and an online presence.  In the early days of the internet, mail order was the only way to buy items not available in local stores. The first websites that allowed customers to purchase items online were called catalogs. Over time, online catalogs evolved into websites that allowed customers to browse and buy items online. Today, mail order is still an important way for customers to purchase items not available in local stores.

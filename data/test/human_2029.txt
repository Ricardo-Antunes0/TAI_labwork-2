CapturaTalk is a piece of assistive technology software which, when installed onto a mobile phone, allows you to take a picture of some text and then have it read aloud. It was created primarily to help people who require literacy support for disabilities such as dyslexia, or people learning English. As well as scanning pictures and converting them to speech, CapturaTalk is also able to read documents, text messages, contacts, internet pages, PDF files and e-mails received or opened on the phone. CapturaTalk also incorporates the Oxford English Dictionary, so if you aren't sure what a word means you can look it up, and have the definition read out. It was developed by Mobispeech, a joint venture by iansyst Ltd and Raspberry Software Ltd. CapturaTalk has been featured by the BBC and in October 2009 CapturaTalk won the Handheld Learning Award for Innovation in the Special Needs & Inclusion Category at the Handheld Learning Conference 2009.

Mahraganat  or electro mahragan is a genre of Egyptian electronic dance music. Mahraganat is a combination of popular shaabi music played at weddings, EDM and Hip-Hop. DJ Figo made the genre more well known with his team "set dyaba"  released during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. Although this may be the first ever track to go mainstream, Mahraganat was originally conceived first by DJ Ahmed Figo, El Sadat, Feelo and Alaa Fifty in 2004. They shared their music via MP3 files and phones, and it could be heard playing in taxis, tuktuks and on the street. The first ever Mahragan mix was released by the group of friends in 2006 and it was called "Mahragan Elsalam", named after their neighbourhood 'Elsalam', it talked about friendship and how to be mature. History The origins of mahraganat (mahragan songs) lie in the popular (sha'bi) neighborhoods and slums of Cairo. In 2006–7, wedding DJs began combining shaabi music and electronic dance music with influences from reggaeton, grime and rap. In 2011, the Revolution began and the genre reflected the political turmoil as DJ Figo, released his first big single entitled "Ana Baba, Y’lla" Initially, mahragan received no airplay on radio or television and spread online by means of such sites as YouTube and SoundCloud. Like mulid (a different sub-genre of sha'bi music) it is dance music, not meant for sitting and listening.  Mahragan street performances inspire wild, sometimes acrobatic dancing, combining hip-hop moves with raqs baladi (Egyptian folk dancing). In 2014, mahragan DJ Souissy signed a record deal and artists such as EEK (which is purely music without lyrics) brought the genre to the mainstream in Egypt. By summer 2014, mahraganat had become popular throughout all of Egypt. Outside of Egypt, the genre was popularised by alternative culture magazine Audio Kultur and the Cairo Liberation Front. Dance music blog Generation Bass also helped introduce mahraganat to European audiences. In 2014, a group of mahragan DJs toured the Netherlands.

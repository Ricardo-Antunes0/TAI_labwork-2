May Sun (born 1954) is a Los Angeles-based artist known primarily for her public art projects.  Sun works in the mediums of sculpture, mixed media, photography and installation. Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally.  She was born in Shanghai, China, moved to Hong Kong at the age of two with her family and immigrated to the United States in 1971 to attend the University of San Diego. "May Sun often refers to aspects of her Chinese heritage in her work, which consistently crosses cultural and political boundaries as well as the boundaries traditionally separating art forms and disciplines." Her installation "UnderGround" is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Her multi-media installation "L.A./River/China/Town" premiered at the Santa Monica Museum of Art's Art in the Raw series in 1988, and the MOCA-produced radio version of the installation won a Silver Award from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Her installation "Fugitive Landing", created at Capp Street Project in San Francisco, moved on to the MIT List Visual Arts Center in 1991 and to the Asia Society Galleries in New York City in 1994.  She has won numerous awards and fellowships, including two National Endowment for the Arts Visual Artist's Fellowships and a Getty Fellowship for the Visual Arts.

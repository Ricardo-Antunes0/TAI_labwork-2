is a freshwater caldera lake in Satsumasendai, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. It forms part of Imutaike Prefectural Natural Park. Its plant communities were designated a Natural Monument of Japan in 1921 and sixty hectares of wetlands were designated a Ramsar Site in 2005. Geography Imuta-ike is surrounded by mountains; Funamidake , San-o-dake , Katagi-yama , Tōmigashiro , Ī-moriyama (, known due to its beauty also as Imuta-fuji), and there is no incoming large river. The outgoing water flows into Sendai River and Hiwagi River. Imuta-ike is in the last stage of the lake-pond formation cycle and is shrinking with the deposition of sediment. The colour of the pond is brown, 14 on the Forel-Ule scale, and its pH is 6.8; the water of the pond contains organic substances. There are many cherry trees around the pond. About one third of its area, to the northwest, is wetland; dotted by floating islands composed of peat. This is very rare in warm areas and the pond was designated a Natural Monument as the "peat forming vegetation of Imuta-ike" in 1921.

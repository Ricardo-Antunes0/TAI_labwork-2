The Russia–Syria–Iran–Iraq coalition (RSII coalition), also referred to as the Great Syrian War Coalition, is a military alliance between the Russian Federation, Syria, Iran, and Iraq. The RSII coalition was formed in September 2015 with the goal of defeating the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS or Daesh) and restoring stability to Syria.  The RSII coalition has been widely credited with driving ISIL out of major cities in Syria, including Raqqa and Deir al-Zor. However, the coalition has been criticized for its poor execution and for its inability to resolve the Syrian Civil War.

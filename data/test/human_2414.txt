Zelkova × verschaffeltii (Dippel) G.Nicholson (cut-leaf zelkova) is a zelkova cultivar of hybrid origin. It was originally described in 1892 by Leopold Dippel from a cultivated plant as Zelkova japonica var. verschaffeltii, suggesting an eastern Asian origin. In 1896, George Nicholson raised it to species rank as Zelkova verschaffeltii, while its much closer similarity to Zelkova carpinifolia led Augustine Henry to suggest it might be a hybrid between Zelkova carpinifolia and Zelkova abelicea. More recent authors most widely regarded it as a cultivar, either not ascribed to any Zelkova species in particular, or placed under Z. carpinifolia with no suggestion of hybrid origin. Analysis of flavonoids has subsequently proved that it is a hybrid between Zelkova carpinifolia and Zelkova serrata. Name in error The tree was originally misidentified as an elm. The putative cultivar Ulmus 'Pitteurs Pendula' was listed by C. de Vos  in Handboek Supplement 16, 1890, as Ulmus pitteursii pendula. However, Hans M. Heybroek, erstwhile head of the Dutch elm breeding programme at the de Dorschkamp Research Institute for Forestry and Landscape Planning at Wageningen, identified the tree as Zelkova × verschaffeltii.

The game involves the player guiding the small blob-shaped main character named "Plobb" around the screen where he is attacked by enemy bubbles. The aim is to eliminate the bubbles and finally also the arch-enemy in order to win the game and regain Plobb's freedom. The game was created as a research project by Bastiaan van Rooden from Nothing Inc., Switzerland, which develops other freeware games but also advergames among other products. It is available as a stand-alone offline game for download free of charge. First launched in 2005, the game was only available for Windows while a version compatible with Mac OS X was developed in 2007. The game is distributed via download from the website of Nothing Inc.

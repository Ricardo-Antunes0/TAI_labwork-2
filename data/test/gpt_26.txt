Primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA) is a quantifier-free, universal algorithm for solving polynomial equations. Although it is not Turing complete, PRA can be used to solve problems that are beyond the reach of other algorithms.  PRA was first proposed by David Woodruff in 1984, and has since been extensively studied. It is currently the fastest known algorithm for solving polynomial equations, running in polynomial time on any computer. PRA has also been shown to be an efficient tool for solving systems of linear equations.

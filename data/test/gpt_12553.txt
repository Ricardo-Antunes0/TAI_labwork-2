South Australia (commonly abbreviated as SA) is a state in the southern region of Australia. It covers an area of 9,594 square kilometres (3,665 sq mi).

South Australia was first inhabited by Aboriginal Australians and was part of New South Wales until the British colonisation of the continent in 1836. The establishment of a permanent European settlement in South Australia was delayed by a series of military campaigns during the Napoleonic Wars, but finally occurred when Sir Richard Burton and his party reached Mount Lofty in December 1836. The colony was administered as a crown land from 1836 to 1851, when it became a self-governing colony under the control of the Governor. In 1852 it became a province of Australia. In the early years of European settlement there were numerous clashes between settlers and Aboriginal people over land ownership and other issues.  South Australia achieved responsible government in 1856, and during the 1860s and 1870s it developed as one of Australia's most important agricultural and mining states. Its industries have included wine production, sheep farming, steelmaking and manufacturing, and information technology. The state has an economy that is highly diversified; while its primary sector—agriculture and mining—remains important, tourism is also a major source of revenue. There are several large industrial areas in South Australia including Adelaide,

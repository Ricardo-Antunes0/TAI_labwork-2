White Nancy is a structure at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, that was built in 1856. It is the second-oldest building at the Academy, after the Old North Building.  White Nancy was originally a two-story wooden structure with a gabled roof. It was replaced in 1904 by a new two-story brick structure. The original White Nancy was used as a dormitory for cadets.

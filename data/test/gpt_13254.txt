Labyrinthite is a soft, green to blue-green mineral that typically occurs as small, elongated crystals. It has a vitreous luster and is slightly pleochroic. The color can vary from greenish-blue to pale pink or purple. The luster can be iridescent, giving a rainbow effect when light shines on the mineral. The hardness is 3.5 on the Mohs scale and the optical character of the mineral is birefringent. The specific gravity is 3.4-3.8.  Labyrinthite is found in a few locations in the world, most notably Brazil, Madagascar, and Mexico. It is also found in Germany, Italy, and Peru. The most common type of labyrintite found is labyrintite of jadeite, which is often associated with other rare minerals like turquoise, amethyst, and diamond.

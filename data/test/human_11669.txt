Käte Niederkirchner (born Käte Appel or Käte Dienstbach:  30 January 1944 - 19 November 2019) was a German politician (SED / PDS) and Pediatrician.   In 1967 she became the youngest member of the East German parliament ("Volkskammer").   Her life was impacted by having been born with a famous aunt, the Communist resistance activist Käthe Niederkirchner who was killed by Nazi paramilitaries at Ravensbrück concentration camp in 1944, and who was posthumously much celebrated by East Germany's political leadership. Early life  Käte Appel was born at Chelyabinsk, an industrial city east of the Urals.   "Appel", the family name by which she was known to comrades, was her father's party pseudonym.   Her father's name had been Karl Dienstbach when he had emigrated to the Soviet Union in 1932 in order to avoid the prison term to which he had been sentenced at a district court in Frankenthal following his conviction on a charge of industrial espionage.   During the 1920s Karl Dienstbach (1900-1977) had come to the attention of the authorities in Germany as a vociferous trades unionist and Communist activist.   Käte Dienstbach's mother, Mia Niederkirchner (1911-1982), was also a political activist, living in Soviet exile  at the time of Käte's birth.   Her parents had originally met in the Hotel Lux in Moscow, which during the Hitler years had become a vast hostel for exiled German communists.    During the final years of the war both her parents were working with prisoners of war in the Gulag network around Chelyabinsk, as political educators for the National Committee for a Free Germany.   According to another source her parents were both working as officials at a prisoner of war camp, her mother as a secretary and her father as a cook.

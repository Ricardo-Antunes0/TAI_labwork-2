HL Tauri (abbreviated HL Tau) is a very young T Tauri star in the constellation Taurus, approximately  from Earth in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. The luminosity and effective temperature of  imply that its age is less than 100,000 years. At apparent magnitude 15.1, it is too faint to be seen with the unaided eye. It is surrounded by a protoplanetary disk marked by dark bands visible in submillimeter radiation that may indicate a number of planets in the process of formation. It is accompanied by the Herbig–Haro object , a jet of gas emitted along the rotational axis of the disk that is colliding with nearby interstellar dust and gas. Protoplanetary disk Indications of a protoplanetary disk were first presented in 1975 with infrared spectral observations in wavelengths between 2 and 4 microns, which were made possible by the recent invention of the indium antimonide photovoltaic detector. Of 29 very young stars examined, only  showed a strong absorption feature centered on the expected 3.07 micron absorption of ice particles, which authors attributed to the ν1, ν3, and 2ν2 vibrational frequencies of the O–H bond. A 1982 survey identified  as one of the most highly polarized  stars known, along with DG Tauri and V536 Aquilae.

The Bavarian Railway Museum (Bayerisches Eisenbahnmuseum or BEM) is a railway museum in Nuremberg, Germany. It is the world's largest railway museum, and has a collection of over one million items.  The Bavarian Railway Museum was founded in 1924 as the "Nürnberger Eisenbahnmuseum". The museum initially occupied a small building on the former Nuremberg railway station square. During the 1930s, the museum's collections grew rapidly, and in 1938 it moved to its present location on the eastern edge of the city. A major expansion took place between 1966 and 1972, and since then the museum has continued to expand its collections. In 2012, the museum announced a plan to build a new facility on the site of an old military barracks in the borough of Schwabing-Fürth.

A letter collection or collection of letters is a library or archive containing a variety of written communication, typically letters. Letters may be collected for their historical significance, for aesthetic value, or for the personal correspondence of individuals.  The earliest known letter collection is the Library of Alexandria, which was founded in the 3rd century BC and contained a collection of more than 150,000 letters. The British Library is believed to be the world's oldest national library, dating from the early 17th century. Today, letter collections are found in libraries all over the world, particularly in countries with a history of letter writing.  Letter collections can range in size from a few hundred letters to millions of letters. The largest collections are found in national libraries and archives, while smaller collections can be found in private collections or museums. Many letter collections are available online through digital archives and databases.

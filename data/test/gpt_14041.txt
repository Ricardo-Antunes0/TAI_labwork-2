Shirnengiin Ayuush (; 1903â€“1938) was a Mongolian Buddhist nun, yogini and author.  Shirnengiin Ayuush was born in 1903 in the Gobi Desert, in what is now Inner Mongolia, China. She was a Buddhist nun and yogini, and authored several books on Buddhism and meditation. She died in 1938 from illness.  Shirnengiin Ayuush was one of the few women to write about Buddhism in Mongolia during the 1930s and 1940s. Her writings reflect the traditional Mongolian Buddhist view of the body as an instrument of spiritual practice, and her descriptions of meditation are often poetic.

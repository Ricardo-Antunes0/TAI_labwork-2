Passive smoking is the inhalation of tobacco smoke, through the mouth or nose, without the use of an electronic cigarette, cigar, pipe, or smokeless tobacco product. The World Health Organization defines passive smoking as "the inhalation of tobacco smoke, in any form, by someone other than the smoker."  Passive smoking is a major public health concern. It is estimated that passive smoking contributes to about 3 percent of all deaths from cancer and about 10 percent of all deaths from lung cancer. It is also associated with other serious health conditions, including increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and respiratory infections.  Passive smoking has been shown to be addictive. In laboratory animals exposed to nicotine, passive smoking can produce symptoms that are similar to those seen in people who are addicted to nicotine.

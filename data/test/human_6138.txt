The Classic Lake Conference was a conference for high schools in the west metro area of the Twin Cities, Minnesota. The Classic Lake Conference was one of many in the Minneapolisâ€“St. Paul metro area that divide schools in proximity into different conferences. The mission of the conference was to promote and recognize excellence by providing quality experiences for students in programs of academics, arts, athletics and activities. The Classic Lake Conference conducted its activities under the auspices of and in concert with the Minnesota State High School League. The five member high schools were, Robbinsdale Armstrong High School (Plymouth), Edina High School (Edina), Hopkins High School (Minnetonka), Minnetonka High School (Minnetonka), and Wayzata High School (Plymouth). Until 1999, Richfield High School was a member but left because of declining enrollment and changing demographics.  Until 2005, St. Louis Park High School and Robbinsdale Cooper High School were also a members, but left for the North Suburban Conference due to their smaller student bodies.

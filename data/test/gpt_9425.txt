Beatles for Sale is the fourth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 8 November 1963 in the United Kingdom, and on 15 November 1963 in the United States. The album was produced by George Martin and features the band's first US number one hit, "I Want to Hold Your Hand".  The Beatles were starting to gain some popularity in America and some of their songs were beginning to be played on American radio stations. In order to make more money, the Beatles decided to release an album of their recordings that they had made for British television. The album consisted mainly of covers of old pop songs, many of which had been hits in the past. "I Want to Hold Your Hand" was released as the album's lead single and became a hit in both the UK and America. The other singles released from the album—"She Loves You" and "Can't Buy Me Love"—were also successful. "Beatles for Sale" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1964, and platinum in 1968.  The Beatles recorded nine songs for "Beatles for Sale". Six of them were cover versions of old pop songs, while one—the title track—"was written primarily by George Martin."   The Beatles initially recorded "I Want to Hold Your Hand" with producer George Martin as part of a BBC television project that was never broadcast. The song was subsequently released as a single in December 1962 in Britain, where it reached number two

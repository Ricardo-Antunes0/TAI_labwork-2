Co-citation Proximity Analysis or CPA is a document similarity measure that uses  citation analysis to assess semantic similarity between documents at both the global document level as well as at individual section-level. The similarity measure builds on the co-citation analysis approach, but differs in that it exploits the information implied in the placement of citations within the full-texts of documents. Co-citation Proximity Analysis was conceived by B. Gipp in 2006 and the description of the document similarity measure was later published by Gipp and Beel in 2009. The similarity measure rests on the assumption that within a documentâ€™s full-text, the documents cited in close proximity to each other tend to be more strongly related than those documents cited farther apart. The figure to the right illustrates the concept. The CPA approach to document similarity assumes the documents B and C to be more strongly related than the documents B and A, because the citations to B and C occur within the same sentence, whereas the citations to B and A are separated by several paragraphs.

Interstate 590 (I-590) is a north–south auxiliary Interstate Highway in the U.S. state of Oregon. The highway connects the cities of Medford and Ashland, running mainly through the Rogue Valley and Central Oregon.  I-590 begins at an interchange with I-5 in the city of Medford, just south of downtown. The freeway heads north as a four-lane divided highway through suburban areas, intersecting several major streets before reaching the town of Grants Pass. North of Grants Pass, I-590 narrows to two lanes and curves to the east as it traverses the Applegate Valley. At milepost 127, I-590 crosses the Rogue River into the city of Ashland. Here, the freeway becomes a divided highway once again and continues eastward through downtown Ashland before reaching its northern terminus at an interchange with US 97 in the town ofOntario.   I-590 has been criticized for its poor condition and for causing gridlock on its busiest sections during peak traffic hours. The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) has made significant upgrades to I-590 in recent years, including widening and reconstruction of many sections, which have improved traffic flow significantly. ODOT has also ongoing plans to widen I-590 from four to six lanes in both directions between Ontario and Grants Pass, as well as constructing a new bypass around downtown Ashland.

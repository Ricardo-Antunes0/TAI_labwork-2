Catherine Lépront (June 1951, Le Creusot – May 20, 2017, Villeneuve-d'Ascq) was a French composer.  Catherine Lépront studied composition at the Paris Conservatoire with Olivier Messiaen and Olivier Cadiot, graduating in 1976. Her early works were influenced by Messiaen, but she later developed a personal style that combined elements of neoclassicism and minimalism. She won the prestigious Prix de Rome in 1984 for her opera "Le Roi David". After a hiatus of several years, she returned to compose in the mid-1990s, and her work has since been widely recognised.  Lépront died of cancer on May 20, 2017 at the age of 69.

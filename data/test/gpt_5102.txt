The Bascom Massacre was a confrontation between United States federal agents and the Branch Davidians at their compound near Waco, Texas on February 28, 1993. The confrontation resulted in the deaths of 76 Davidians, including 21 children, and the injury of more than 200 people, including over 70 law enforcement officers.  The events leading up to the massacre began on February 19, 1993, when the FBI attempted to serve a search warrant on the compound of the Branch Davidians. The Davidians resisted the entry into their compound and a gun battle ensued. The Davidians were eventually forced from their compound and retreated to a large building known as the "Command Center."  On February 28, 1993, a large contingent of FBI agents attempted to enter the Command Center. After several hours of negotiation, during which gunfire was exchanged between the FBI and Davidian defenders, the FBI finally entered the building. Once inside, they came under fire from all sides and were forced to retreat.  In total, 76 people died in the Bascom Massacre: 21 children and 47 adults. Over 200 people were injured, including over 70 law enforcement officers.

Boris Petrovich Sveshnikov (1927–1998) was a Russian nonconformist painter. On February 9, 1946, Sveshnikov, then a nineteen-year-old art school student at the Moscow Institute of Applied and Decorative Arts, went to buy kerosene in a nearby shop. On the way, he was arrested for participating in a terrorist group preparing an assassination attempt on Josef Stalin. One of the participants in this fabricated MGB accusation was the artist Lev Kropyvnytsky, with whom Sveshnikov studied at the Institute. Before his so-called trial, Sveshnikov spent a year in prison. Subjected to endless night interrogations, trips from the basements of Lubyanka to Lefortovo Prison and back, sleep deprivation, and jail overcrowding, inevitably brought Sveshnikov to the brink of physical and nervous exhaustion. After a year, he was sentenced to eight-years in maximum security labor camps. Life  The way from Moscow to Ukhtizhemlag (in the Ukhta-Izhvesk region)—through many transit prisons—lasted more than a month. In the crowded Stolypin wagons, Sveshnikov met with officers of the Vlasov army, Soviet prisoners of war, bandits and other criminals, members of forbidden religious sects, as well as political prisoners, who like Sveshnikov were branded “terrorists.”

Causa Mortis is a satiric play by William Shakespeare. It is believed to have been written in 1597–98, and is based on the story of Pyramus and Thisbe.  The play is set in the city of Athens, during the time of the Peloponnesian War. It tells the story of two young people – Pyramus, a prince, and Thisbe, a slave – who are in love but cannot be together because he is promised to another woman and she is promised to another man. They both try to kill themselves so that they can be together, but each time their suicide is thwarted. In the end, Thisbe is killed by Pyramus's father and he dies in grief.

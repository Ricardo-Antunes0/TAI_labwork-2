The Belle Époque or La Belle Époque is a period in French history which refers to the years 1800–1914. The term was first used by the French historian Jules Michelet in 1855 to describe the cultural efflorescence of that period. In the historiography of France, it is usually considered to start with the July Monarchy of Louis-Philippe I (1830–1848) and end with World War I.  The Belle Époque was a time of great social, artistic, and technological progress in France. It saw the widespread introduction of railroads and electric lighting, as well as new types of architecture and furniture. France also became a leading power in continental Europe, playing a leading role in the development of various industries, including automobiles, aviation, and cinema. The period saw the rise of famous authors and artists such as Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas père, Emile Zola, Edmond Rostand, and Georges Clemenceau.  The Belle Époque is often contrasted with the more troubled times of World War I (1914–1918). Despite coming to an end in defeat for France, the Belle Époque represented a period of great national revival and renewed confidence.

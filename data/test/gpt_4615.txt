Hope (born 2010) is a bottlenose dolphin who is the first dolphin to ever be fitted with a satellite tag and learn English.  Hope was born in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico and was transferred to the Dolphin Research Center in Miami, Florida when she was two months old. She quickly became a favorite of the researchers, who were shocked when they discovered that she could communicate in English.  Hope's unique ability to communicate with humans has allowed her to become an invaluable ambassador for dolphins and help educate people about the species. Her story has been featured on television shows, newspapers, and websites around the world, and she has even been invited to speak at conferences about dolphin conservation.  Hope's ultimate goal is to help protect dolphins worldwide and inspire others to do their part to protect this endangered species.

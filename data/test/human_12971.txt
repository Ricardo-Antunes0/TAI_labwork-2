Seamus Martin McDonagh (born 6 October 1952), known as Jim McDonagh, is a former association football goalkeeper who won 25 caps for Ireland and made more than 400 appearances in the English leagues. He then became a goalkeeping coach, working with numerous clubs in the English game until joining Martin O'Neill's coaching team at Sunderland in 2011. In November 2013 he was appointed to the same role with the Republic of Ireland national team by O'Neill, and in 2019 he followed O'Neill to Nottingham Forest as head goalkeeping coach Playing career McDonagh started his career at his hometown club Rotherham United, and spent a month on loan at Manchester United in 1973, before joining Bolton Wanderers, initially on loan, taking over from the recently departed Barry Siddall. An ever-present during the Second Division Championship-winning side of 1977–78, he set a club record of conceding only 33 goals in a 42-match season. For the following two seasons in the top flight he was also an ever-present and did well enough for Everton to sign him for £250,000 when Bolton were relegated in 1979–80. Within a year Neville Southall had come through the ranks at Everton and McDonagh found himself back at Bolton. Another demotion followed in 1982–83, even with McDonagh managing to score a goal, and he moved on to Notts County for two seasons before wandering around a further six English clubs as well as teams in the USA. It was while he was at Bolton that he received the first of 25 caps for Ireland.

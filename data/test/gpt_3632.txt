In India, President's rule is the suspension of the Constitution of India by the president of India. The president can do this either on his own initiative, or on the recommendation of the prime minister.  President's rule is a provisional constitutional arrangement in India that allows for a single individual to exercise authority as both head of state and head of government. The president's rule is typically used when the ruling party lacks a majority in the parliament, or when the prime minister is unable to govern effectively due to political instability.  President's rule was first introduced in 1952 during the term of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Since then, it has been used sixteen times, most recently during the term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi from May 2014 to May 2017.

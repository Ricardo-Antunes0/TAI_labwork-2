Kireedam  is a 2007 Indian Tamil-language action drama film directed by A. L. Vijay in his directorial debut. The film is a remake of the 1989 Malayalam film of the same name. It stars Ajith Kumar, Trisha and Rajkiran, while Vivek, Saranya, Ajay, and Santhanam appear in supporting roles. The film's score and soundtrack are composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar, while Tirru was the cinematographer. The film opened on 20 July 2007 to positive reviews and became a hit at the box office. It was dubbed into Telugu as Poorna Market. Plot  Sakthivel (Ajith Kumar) is an implicitly obedient son of a sincere policeman Rajarajan (Rajkiran). Sakthi and his father share the same dream: that of seeing him enter the police force. The entire family comprising two other daughters, the mother (Saranya), and a wastrel of a brother-in-law (Vivek) are cuddly and close-knit. Rajarajan is from the old school of life, and honesty is his watchword. In a venal system, this lands him in trouble often. Divya (Trisha) is a charming college student. She has some comical run-ins with Sakthi and eventually falls in love with him. Elsewhere, Rajarajan, who books an MLA’s son for an offence, is hauled up over the coals and sent on a ‘punishment transfer’ to a place, which is run as personal fief by a local dada Varadarajan (Ajay). One thing leads to another, and Sakthi is unwittingly sucked into the unholy vortex. Just as he is about to join the police force, destiny decrees otherwise: his life is not going to be the same again. A father’s dream lies shattered while a son, despite his unwillingness, has to fight an honest war beyond the matrix of a law. It is a situation that is actually an emotional cauldron. How the father and son reconcile to the new reality is the story.

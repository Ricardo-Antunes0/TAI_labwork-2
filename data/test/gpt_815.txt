Dryandra subg. Dryandra is an obsolete clade of plants in the daisy family. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek word "drysaina", meaning "of the dryads", because many of these plants were thought to be favorite plants of the dryads.  The members of this clade are small, perennial herbs or small shrubs with simple, generally ovate leaves and flower heads containing a number of small, white or pink flowers. The fruit is a small capsule.

The Corona EXiV is an automobile manufactured by Toyota from 1998 to 2002. It is the successor to the Corona Coupe and was the first car in Toyota's line-up to be powered by a V6 engine.   The EXiV was built on the platform of the Camry, and featured a number of improvements over its predecessor. The EXiV was available in both a coupe and convertible body style, and came standard with a 4-cylinder engine, but also offered a V6 option. The EXiV also received several updates for its 1999 model year, including updated suspension and brakes.   The Corona EXiV was discontinued after 2002, but has since been revived in Japan as the Toyota Auris.

The International School Sport Federation (ISF) is an international sports governing body for school sport. Around  the  1960s  international  sporting  contests  between  schools  were  on  the  increase.  Besides  occasional  and  haphazard  meetings  between  two  or  more  schools,  tournaments  were  beginning  to  be  organised  regularly  in  different  disciplines:  in  handball  from  1963,  in  volleyball  from  1969,  in  football  from  1970  and  from  1971  also  in  basketball. Today 21 sports have a separate World Schools Championship (WSC) with 10–12 championships being held per year. Each World Schools Championship usually last from 3–7 days. Yearly, more than 10.0000 pupils from all over the World take part in ISF World Schools Championship. Until 2017, only 21 Sports have a separate World School Championship (WSC). Other sports exist in Games (Summer , Winter or Combat) and havent separate WSC.

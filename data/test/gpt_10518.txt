The Crystal Palace was an exhibition hall and entertainment venue located at the corner of Ste. Catherine and Maisonneuve Streets in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was designed by Edward Durell Stone and built from 1884 to 1887. It was originally named the Montreal Exhibition Building after the 1876 International Exposition in Paris.  The Crystal Palace was a popular tourist destination for Montrealers and visitors from throughout Canada and the United States from the late 19th century until its demolition in 1936. It also served as an important venue for Canadian political and social events, including the 1896 Quebec general election and the 1897 meeting of the Canadian Parliament. The Palace was also a favorite spot for theatrical performances, including American productions such as The Jazz Singer (1927) and Singin' in the Rain (1952).  The Palace was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 1924 and a Monument historique de la Ville de Montr√©al in 1931. In 1966, it was designated a square on the Register of Historic Places of Quebec.

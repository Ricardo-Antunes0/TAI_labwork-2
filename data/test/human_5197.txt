Bumblescratch is an original sung-through musical with book, music and lyrics by Robert J. Sherman. The musical premiered at the Adelphi Theatre in London on 4 September 2016 as a one night, celebrity gala charity event in aid of Variety, the Children's Charity (UK). This was done as part of weekend commemorations of the 350th anniversary of the Great Fire of London. The staged concert was directed and choreographed by Stewart Nicholls with music direction by Tom Kelly, orchestrations by Rowland Lee and design by Gabriella Slade. An Original Cast Recording which includes musical highlights from the show was recorded at Angel Recording Studios on September 12–13, 2016 in Islington, London.

In the Adelphi cast were Darren Day, Jessica Martin, Michael Xavier, Ilan Galkoff, Alastair Barron, Jacob Chapman, James Dangerfield, Emma Harold, Katie Kerr, Jessie May, Teddy Moynihan, Cathy Read and Dickie Wood. Prior to this performance, there was a workshop of the show held on May 9 and 10, 2013 at the Network Theatre in London. Theme and Inspiration "The characters in Bumblescratch each experience one form of isolation or another. Redemption comes when a character no longer feels isolated. The overarching theme in Bumblescratch is "redemption of the unredeemable". This is why Melbourne had to be a plague rat. Otherwise his redemption would have come across as phony. The audience has to believe that Melbourne is a deeply vile creature, which he is. So when Melbourne rises up, his redemption too becomes plausible."

Delirium (also known as acute confusional state) is a medical condition caused by a brain disorder. It is a critical stage of a disease where the person has lost touch with reality.   Symptoms of delirium can vary, but common symptoms include a change in mood, talking excessively, hallucinations, and seizures. If left untreated, delirium can lead to death.

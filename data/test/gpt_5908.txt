Lower Huxley Hall is a moated manor house in the village of Huxley, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England. It is an example of the Jacobean style.  Lower Huxley Hall was built in 1611 by Sir Thomas Lucy, a lawyer and MP for Gloucester. The estate descended through the Lucy family until it was sold in 1771 to Sir John Crosse, a wealthy banker and MP for Gloucester. The Crosse family retained ownership of Lower Huxley Hall until it was sold in 1937 to the Lower Huxley Farm Company. The farm company leased the hall to a number of tenants until it was sold in 1982 to English Heritage.  Today, Lower Huxley Hall is open to the public as a tourist attraction. It is used as a venue for weddings, private parties, and corporate events.

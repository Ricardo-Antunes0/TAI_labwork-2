Grias cauliflora, the anchovy pear, (also called the salmonberry) is a small, deciduous, flowering tree in the family Rosaceae.  The anchovy pear is native to the eastern United States and Canada, but it has been widely planted and naturalized elsewhere in North America and elsewhere in the world. It is a shrub or small tree growing to 8–10 m tall, with a trunk up to 1.5 m diameter. The leaves are opposite, 3–7 cm long, narrow lance-shaped, and glossy green on the upper surface but dull on the underside. The flowers are 2–3 cm diameter, yellow with a purple blotch in the middle, and are produced in late spring or early summer. The fruit is a small red or pink drupe 2–3 cm diameter.  The anchovy pear is used as an ornamental tree and for its fruit which is eaten fresh or used in jams, jellies, and pies. The wood is not used commercially.

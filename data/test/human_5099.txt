Bouvier's red colobus (Piliocolobus bouvieri) is a species of colobus monkey rediscovered in the Republic of the Congo in 2015, after four decades without a confirmed sighting. Description Bouvier's red colobus has brownish-red fur on its body that is lighter than its closest relative, the Bioko red colobus (P. pennantii pennantii).  Its head has a patch of black to chocolate brown fur that is smaller than that of P. p. pennantii.  It has a white chin and whiskers.  A black band of fur extends from above the eyes to the temples.  The monkey's eyes are surround by large, pink eyerings.  The tail of P. bouvieri  is long in proportion to its small body and is dark brown at the root, fading to brownish-red at the tip.  The fur on the species' underside is lighter than the fur on its back.  Bouvier's red colobus is thought to exhibit considerable facial variation from individual to individual, varying from light flesh-colored with blackish cheeks and brows to darker tones throughout the face, excluding the nose and lips.

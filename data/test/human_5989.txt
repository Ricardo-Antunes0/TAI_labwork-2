Castlevania: Dracula X is a 1995 platform game developed and published by Konami for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the second and final Castlevania installment to be released for the Super NES. It shares the gameplay and storyline of Castlevania: Rondo of Blood, which was previously released exclusively in Japan on the PC Engine Super CD-ROM2 in 1993. While the plot is similar to Rondo of Blood and it uses many of that game's graphics, it features all-new levels and altered gameplay elements, rather than being a direct port because of the limits of the Super NES cartridge format and exclusivity agreements with PC Engine maker NEC. It was released on July 21, 1995, in Japan, in September 1995 in the US, February 22, 1996, in Europe, and on June 22, 1996, in Australia as an uncensored release. The game was re-released as a Wii U Virtual Console download in Japan on April 23, 2014, in North America on October 2, 2014, and the PAL regions on November 13, 2014. It was released again for New Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console download in North America on December 29, 2016, and in Europe and Australia on January 26, 2017. The game was also re-released as a part of the Castlevania Advance Collection on September 23, 2021, for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Windows. It was bundled alongside Game Boy Advance games Castlevania: Circle of the Moon, Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance, and Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow.

In toss juggling, Rubenstein's Revenge is a juggling pattern in which a performer juggles three balls, then catches the fourth ball and throws it over their head, without letting go of the first three balls. It was invented by Bob Rubenstein and was first performed at the Yale Juggling Club in 1974.

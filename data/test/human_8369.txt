Vietnam: 1965-1975 is a board wargame that simulates the Vietnam war. It is designed by Nick Karp and was published in 1984 by Victory Games a subsidiary of Avalon Hill. Karp was a 21-year-old senior at Princeton University when he designed the game. He called it a "serious attempt" to simulate the conflict. Karp spent 18 months researching and designing the game. It combines military and political concerns. "The emphasis of the game is on politics," said Karp. "Every action in the game has a corresponding morale effect in the U.S. and in South Vietnam: bombing the North, sending new troops, high casualty levels. The U.S. has to balance military needs with the ability of the U.S. to cater to them." The game includes a 48-page manual on topics such as "Search and Destroy Operations," "Airmobility," "Pacification" and "Strategic Bombing." Smaller scenarios can be played in an evening, but to play the entire war (campaign) can take 100 to 400 hours.

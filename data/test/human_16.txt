Dubai Destination (foaled 11 February 1999) is a retired American-bred Thoroughbred racehorse and active sire. As a two-year-old he showed great promise, winning two of his three races including the Champagne Stakes, but was beaten on his only run in 2002. He returned after a year-long absence in 2003 and recorded his biggest win when taking the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot. He was retired to stud at the end of the year and has had some notable successes as a breeding stallion. Background Dubai Destination is a bay horse with no white markings bred in Kentucky by Calumet Farm. His sire, Kingmambo was a highly successful breeding stallion whose progeny included the British Classic winners Russian Rhythm, King's Best, Henrythenavigator, Virginia Waters and Rule of Law as well as major winners in Japan (El Condor Pasa), France (Divine Proportions) and the United States (Lemon Drop Kid). Dubai Destination's dam, Mysterial showed no ability as a racehorse but became a very successful broodmare: her other foals have included Librettist (Prix Jacques Le Marois, Prix du Moulin) and Secret Number (Cumberland Lodge Stakes). Mysterial was a half-sister to Agnes World, a Japanese-trained sprinter who won the Prix de l'Abbaye and the July Cup in Europe.

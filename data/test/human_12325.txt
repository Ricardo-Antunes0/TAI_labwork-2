A routing algorithm decides the path followed by a packet from the source to destination routers in a network. An important aspect to be considered while designing a routing algorithm is avoiding a deadlock. Turn restriction routing is a routing algorithm for mesh-family of topologies which avoids deadlocks by restricting the types of turns that are allowed in the algorithm while determining the route from source node to destination node in a network. Reason for deadlock  A deadlock (shown in fig 1) is a situation in which no further transportation of packets can take place due to the saturation of network resources like buffers or links. The main reason for a deadlock is the cyclic acquisition of channels in the network. For example, consider there are four channels in a network. Four packets have filled up the input buffers of these four channels and needs to be forwarded to the next channel. Now assume that the output buffers of all these channels are also filled with packets that need to be transmitted to the next channel. If these four channels form a cycle, it is impossible to transmit packets any further because the output buffers and input buffers of all channels are already full. This is known as cyclic acquisition of channels and this results in a deadlock.

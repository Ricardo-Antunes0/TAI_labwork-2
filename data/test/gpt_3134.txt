Rancho Las Cienegas was a   Mexican land grant in present-day Kern County, California given in 1842 by Governor Juan B. Alvarado to Andrés Pico and his wife, María Antonia Yorba. The grant was located in what is now the town of Cienega Valley.  Rancho Las Cienegas was named for the nearby Las Cienegas Creek, which in turn was named for the mythical Queen of the Night, a figure in Spanish mythology. The Pico family had arrived in California in 1820 and settled in what is now San Diego. Andrés Pico had served as an alcalde and captain of the militia during the Mexican-American War. In 1842, he received a land grant from Governor Alvarado consisting of along the Las Cienegas Creek.   The Pico family established a rancho that stretched from what is now Cienega Valley south to present-day Oildale. The rancho was noted for its extensive oak and sycamore timber, which were used to build houses, barns, and other structures. Rancho Las Cienegas also included several horses, cattle, and sheep.   Andrés Pico died in 1851, but his widow continued to run the ranch until her death in 1865. The Pico property was sold several times over the next few years, but it eventually fell into disrepair and was destroyed by a fire in 1907. Today

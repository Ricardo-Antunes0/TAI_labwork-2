Xerolinus is a genus of darkling beetle. It consists of approximately thirty species found in the West Indies. Michael A. Ivie and Charles J. Hart named and circumscribed the genus in 2016. Taxonomic history The genus Xerolinus was circumscribed in 2016 by Montana State University coleopterists Michael A. Ivie and Charles J. Hart. They initially included twenty-nine species, which were mostly transferred from the genus Diastolinus. In a separate 2016 paper, Hart and Ivie described two new Xerolinus species. Ivie and Hart designated X. sallei, which French etymologists Étienne Mulsant and Claudius Rey initially described as Diastolinus sallei in 1859, to be the type species of Xerolinus. The generic name Xerolinus has a masculine gender. Its etymology comes from the Greek  (xērós; "dry, arid") combined with the ending of the generic name Diasolinus. This reflects the habitat these beetles are found in. Xerolinus is in the subtribe Opatrina within the tribe Opatrini.

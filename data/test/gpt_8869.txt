The  Neustrelitz Palace  in Neustrelitz, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, is a large Baroque palace located on the right bank of the River Mulde and was the residence of the German Crown Prince from 1811 to 1872.  The Neustrelitz Palace was designed by the court architect Johann Georg von Hildebrandt in 1768â€“1772, as a summer residence for Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Construction commenced in 1768 and was not completed until 1772 due to Frederick's death in 1786 and subsequent succession of his son, the crown prince. It became the primary home of the crown prince and his family. In 1811, it became the residence of Wilhelm I, King of Prussia. The palace was badly damaged by Allied bombing in World War II and has been restored since then. Today, it is used mainly for special events and is open to the public.   The Neustrelitz Palace occupies an area of 720 square metres (7,500 square feet) and is composed of three wings facing south, east and west respectively. It contains 55 rooms including a ballroom, a chapel, a theatre and several dining rooms. The palace also contains a number of outbuildings such as a stables, a brewery and a wine cellar.

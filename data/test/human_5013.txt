Johannes or Johan Teyler (23 May 1648 – c.1709) was a Dutch Golden Age painter, engraver, mathematics teacher, and promoter of the technique in color printmaking now known as à la poupée. Biography Teyler was born at Nijmegen.  His father was William Taylor, an English or Scottish mercenary, who changed his name to Teyler. Johan studied Latin at the Latin school of Nijmegen and Mathematics at the Kwartierlijke Academie, where he wrote a dissertation in favor of Descartes. After the death of his father, he studied in Leiden and afterwards acquired a post as Professor of Math and Philosophy in Nijmegen in 1670. He was a respected professor but was overlooked for promotion due to his Cartesian ideas. Through the mediation of his friend Gottfried Leibniz he attempted to acquire a professorship in Wolfenbüttel but gave up after discussions with Christiaan Huygens. The rest of his career was outside Academia. In 1676 he became Vestingbouwkundige fortication manager for Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg during the Scanian War. In 1678 he also became tutor for the Elector's sons.

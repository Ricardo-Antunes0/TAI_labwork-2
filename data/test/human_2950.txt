Lawrence A. Fernsworth was an American author, journalist, and activist against fascism, who wrote about the Spanish Civil War in such books as Spain's Struggle for freedom, Dictators and Democrats, Andorra: Mountain Museum of Feudal Europe, Spain's Schedule of War and Next Round in Spain. He gained international attention as a foreign correspondent covering the Spanish Civil War for The Times of London and The New York Times. He authored several articles for Foreign Affairs magazine: "Revolutionary Forces in Catalonia", "Back of the Spanish Rebellion", "Mass Movements in Spain", "Andorra: the Passing of Europe's Last Feudal State", and "Whither Spain?". He was a notable Catholic reporter of the Spanish Civil War, alongside Ernest Hemingway and Taylor of the Chicago Tribune. The American press attempted to suppress his reporting during the Spanish Civil War: "In January 1977, Historia revealed for the first time in Spain what Seldes, Matthews, Hemingway, Fernsworth and others attempted to report in this country [Spain], that 'Nazism and Fascism were accepted and became Franco's policy from the first days of the war. These facts the American press also largely suppressed, preferring to call Hitlerâ€™s and Mussolini's collaborator Franco a nationalist,' asserts [George] Seldes."

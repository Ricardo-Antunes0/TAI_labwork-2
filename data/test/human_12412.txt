The locality of Youanmite is part of the Shire of Moira Local Government Area. It is located near the intersection of Youanmite and Katamatite roads, approximately 25 km southwest of Yarrawonga and approximately 200 km northeast of Melbourne, Australia. Youanmite was once a small town having its own schools, churches, and post office. Comprising medium to large farms the area is predominantly agricultural, focusing on grain production as well as sheep and cattle grazing. Early years The traditional owners of the land are the Yorta Yorta people who inhabited a large area south of the Murray river. It was not until 1824, when Hamilton Hume and William Hovell passed through the area on their expedition from New South Wales to Geelong in Victoria, that the land was assessed and opened for settlement. Squatters soon moved in and vast stations for wheat production and livestock grazing were quickly established. During the 1860s the Victorian Land Acts allowed for the subdivision of large holdings and a provision for Selectors to take up small allotments at minimal cost. This saw an increase in the population of the area and the need to establish more local facilities. Four schools had been established in the area prior to 1920 along with a hotel, sawmill and dairy.

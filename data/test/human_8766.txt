The Pöschel Equator was a single engine, 6/8 seat amphibian built in the 1970s featuring glass-fibre covered fuselage.  Three aircraft were built, each with different engine or wing positions, but no production followed. Design and development Günther Pöschel designed the Equator as a small executive transport which could operate from land or water.  It used the then quite novel glass-fibre composite material for the skin of its flying surfaces and fuselage in order to achieve a smooth and watertight finish.  The first version to fly, the P-300 Equator, was completed as a landplane with a fixed undercarriage and was intended to provide proof of principle. It had a high, cantilever wing of straight tapered plan and no dihedral, carrying a full span combination of ailerons and slotted flaps.  These surfaces replaced the original full span flaps plus lateral control spoilers, which were found ineffective. Despite its landplane configuration, this first aircraft had the small outboard floats intended for production amphibians; these rotated to the wingtips in flight and remained rotated for land operation.

Gaius Curtius Justus was a Roman senator who held several posts in the emperor's service during the Antonine dynasty. He was suffect consul in 150 with Gaius Julius Julianus as his colleague. Justus is known primarily through surviving inscriptions, although he could be identical with the Curtius Justus mentioned as a scriptor rei rusticae by Gargilius Martialis (2.1.4,7). Life  Based on his membership in the Pollia tribe, Justus' origin is thought to be in north Italy. His cursus honorum is known from an inscription set up at Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa in modern Romania. His career began in his teens as one of the quattuorviri viarum curandarum, or overseers of the maintenance of the public roads of Rome. This was one of the four boards that comprised the vigintiviri; membership in the vigintiviri was a preliminary and required first step toward a gaining entry into the Roman Senate.  Next Justus was elected quaestor, which he served this at Rome, and upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy he would be enrolled in the Senate. After this Hadrian adlected him inter tribunicos. Justus completed this portion of his Senatorial career as peregrine praetor.

Courtfield, Welsh Bicknor, Herefordshire, England is a country house dating from the early 19th century. The present building stands on the site of a much older mansion which, according to tradition, was home to Henry V for the early years of his life. This house was originally called Greenfield or Greyfield but was renamed Courtfield at that time. Nothing now remains of that building and the present house was erected in the very early 19th century by William Michael Vaughan. The Vaughans had purchased the estate in the 16th century. Staunchly Roman Catholic, and much persecuted in the 17th and 18th centuries; in the mid-19th century Herbert Vaughan, later a cardinal and Archbishop of Westminster, was brought up at the house, born into a large family, an unusually high number of whom entered the church. In 1950 Courtfield was sold by Patrick Vaughan to the Mill Hill Missionaries who ran a House of Formation at the house. In 2010, the mission was closed and the house sold back to the Vaughan family, who had retained ownership of the wider estate. Courtfield is a Grade II listed building. The house is not open to the public. History The medieval manor of Grayfield, or Greenfield, was a possession of the Montagu(e) family. According to tradition, the young Henry V, born at Monmouth Castle in 1386, was raised at Courtfield between 1387 and 1394. The cradle of Henry V was long thought to have come from Courtfield, although modern furniture historians consider that the crib, now in the Royal Collection, post-dates his birth by at least a century. In the 16th century, the estate was bought by the Vaughans, a cadet branch of the Herbert family. The Vaughans were, and remain, Roman Catholic and suffered considerable persecution in the 17th and 18th centuries.

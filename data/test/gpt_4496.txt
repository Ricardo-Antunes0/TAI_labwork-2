Dismemberment refers, in general terms, to the removal of body parts, most commonly the limbs.  Dismemberment can result from a number of causes, such as accidents, violence, or medical procedures. It can also be a deliberate act, carried out as part of a homicide. In many cases, dismemberment is a means of causing maximum pain and suffering to the victim.  Dismemberment is often fatal, particularly if the victim is unable to receive timely medical care. It can also lead to life-long physical and psychological disabilities.

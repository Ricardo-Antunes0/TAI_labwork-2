Adam Heller (born June 25, 1933) is an Israeli American scientist and engineer. He is Chief Science Officer of SynAgile Corp. of Wilson, Wyoming, consults to Abbott Diabetes Care of Alameda, California, and is Ernest Cockrell Sr. Chair Emeritus of Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. His 1973 paper with James J. Auborn established the feasibility of high energy density, high-voltage, non-rechargeable lithium batteries 1 . Their 3.6-volt lithium thionyl chloride and 3.7-volt lithium sulfuryl chloride batteries 1 remain in use in applications requiring very high energy density and a shelf life of 20 years or more. In 1996, Heller co-founded with his son Ephraim Heller TheraSense Inc. In 2000, the companyâ€™s FreestyleTM micro-coulometric blood glucose assaying system made the monitoring of blood glucose by diabetic people painless by reducing the required blood volume to 300 nL2 . TheraSense was acquired by Abbott Laboratories in 2004 for $1.2 billion.

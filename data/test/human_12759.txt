 is a principle in international law that territory and other property remains with its possessor at the end of a conflict, unless otherwise provided for by treaty; if such a treaty does not include conditions regarding the possession of property and territory taken during the war, then the principle of uti possidetis will prevail. Originating in Roman law, the phrase is derived from the Latin expression uti possidetis, ita possideatis, meaning "may you continue to possess such as you do possess" . This principle enables a belligerent party to claim territory that it has acquired by war. History In the early 17th century, the term was used by England's James I to state that while he recognized the existence of Spanish authority in the regions of the Western Hemisphere in which Spain exercised effective control, he refused to recognize Spanish claims to exclusive possession of all territory west of longitude 46Â° 37' W under the Treaty of Tordesillas.

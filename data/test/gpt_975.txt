The 212th Rifle Division was formed as a standard Red Army rifle division in the late 1920s. It served in the Soviet Union and Mongolia during the 1930s and early 1940s, before being transferred to the Far East to fight in the Second World War. The division fought in the Battle of Changde and Battle of Wujiaochang, before surrendering to Japanese forces in 1945. The division was reformed in 1946, but was disbanded again in 1949. In 1955, it was reorganized and renamed the 212th Separate Rifle Brigade.

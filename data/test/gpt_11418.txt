Intel Hub Architecture (IHA) was Intel's architecture for its high-speed network interface cards for the PC market. It is a modular design, with different IHA cards supporting different networking protocols.  Intel Hub Architecture was first introduced in 2006 with the release of the Intel Core 2 Duo processors. The architecture was designed to improve networking performance over previous generations of Intel processors by using a modular design and supporting multiple networking protocols. The architecture is also used in Intel's Atom line of processors.  Intel Hub Architecture is composed of multiple IHA cards that can be configured to support different networking protocols. IHA cards are based on an x86-64 processor and use a modular design that allows for faster upgrades and support for new networking technologies. IHA supports Gigabit Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, and 802.11n wireless networks.

The nitro-Mannich reaction (or aza-Henry reaction) is the nucleophilic addition of a nitroalkane (or the corresponding nitronate anion) to an imine, resulting in the formation of a beta-nitroamine. With the reaction involving the addition of an acidic carbon nucleophile to a carbon-heteroatom double bond, the nitro-Mannich reaction is related to some of the most fundamental carbon-carbon bond forming reactions in organic chemistry, including the aldol reaction, Henry reaction (nitro-aldol reaction) and Mannich reaction. Although extensive research has been conducted into the aforementioned reactions, the nitro-Mannich reaction has been studied to a far lesser extent even though it has been known for well over 100 years. Significant attention only started to develop after the report of Anderson and co-workers at the turn of the century, and has since resulted in a wide range of novel methodologies. The interest into the nitro-Mannich reaction stems from the synthetic utility of the beta-nitroamine products. They can be further manipulated by various methods, including reductive removal of the nitro group allowing access to monoamines, reduction of the nitro group affords 1,2-diamines and conversion of the nitro group into a carbonyl functionality furnishes beta-aminocarbonyl compounds.

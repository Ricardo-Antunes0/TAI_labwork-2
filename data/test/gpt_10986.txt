Operation Ara침a (Spanish: Operaci칩n Ara침a) is the codename for a covert operation by the Argentine intelligence agency, the Secretariat of State for Security (SEMAR), in which they kidnapped and tortured political opponents during the Dirty War.  The operation was first mentioned in a 1976 report by the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, which classified it as a "human rights violation". It was later investigated by the Argentine National Commission on Memory, Truth and Reconciliation (CONADEP), and declared unconstitutional by the Argentine Supreme Court in 1998.  The name "Ara침a" is Spanish for "spider", and is used to refer to SEMAR's emblematic spider logo.

Midi Olympique is a French bi-weekly newspaper specializing in rugby, belonging to the La Dépêche group and based partly in Toulouse and partly in Paris. The first edition was published on 2 September 1929, meaning it is one of the oldest French weekly still in existence (after Le Canard enchaîné). Jean-Michel Baylet is the director of the publication and Jacques Verdier the managing director. Nicknamed Midol or le jaune (yellow) in reference to the color of the paper is made of, it mainly covers news from rugby, from the professional Top 14 league to the amateur teams of the most modest levels (Fourth Series), and it also devotes a page to rugby league. It was published weekly on a Monday until Spring 2006 when a second edition began to be released each week on Friday. The Monday edition is nicknamed the "rouge" (red) and the Friday the "vert" (green) in reference to the different color used for the nameplate of the two editions.

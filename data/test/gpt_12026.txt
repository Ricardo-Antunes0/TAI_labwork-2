Camp Polonia (now called Campolo, though the name is also used informally) was a Polish concentration camp located in the town of Campolo, near Pisa, in northern Tuscany, Italy. It operated from 1943 to 1945, when it was closed by the Italian authorities.  Camp Polonia was the first concentration camp set up in Italy after the war. It was initially designed as a concentration camp for political prisoners, but it also held Jews and other persecuted groups. At its peak, Camp Polonia held 5,000 prisoners. The majority of inmates were Polish Jews who were deported to the camp from all over Europe.

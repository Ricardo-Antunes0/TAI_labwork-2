In polymer chemistry, in situ polymerization is a reaction in which a polymer is formed without the use of a catalyst. The polymerization reaction is usually carried out in the presence of a solvent or a diluent.  In situ polymerization is used to produce a variety of polymers, including polyurethanes, polycarbonates, and polyamides. The reaction is also used to prepare specialty monomers, such as diallyl phthalate and triallyl phosphate.

Variant angina, and less commonly Prinzmetal angina, vasospastic angina, angina inversa, coronary vessel spasm, or coronary artery vasospasm, is a syndrome typically consisting of angina (cardiac chest pain) in contrast to stable angina which is generally triggered by exertion or intense exercise, commonly occurs in individuals at rest or even asleep and is caused by vasospasm, a narrowing of the coronary arteries due to contraction of the heart's smooth muscle tissue in the vessel walls. In comparison, stable angina is due to the permanent occlusion of these vessels by atherosclerosis (i.e. buildup of fatty plaque and hardening of the arteries). Signs and symptoms In contrast to those with angina secondary to atherosclerosis, people with variant angina are generally younger and have fewer risk factors for coronary artery disease except for smoking, which is a common and very significant risk factor for both types of angina. Sufferers usually have repeated episodes of unexplained (e.g., in the absence of exertion and occurring at sleep or in the early morning hours) chest pain, light-headedness, excessive sweating, and/or reduced exercise tolerance that, unlike atherosclerosis-related angina, typically does not progress to myocardial infarction (heart attack). Unlike cases of atherosclerosis-related stable angina, these symptoms are often unrelated to exertion and occur in night or early morning hours. (However, individuals with atherosclerosis-related unstable angina may similarly exhibit night to early morning hour symptoms that are unrelated to exertion.)

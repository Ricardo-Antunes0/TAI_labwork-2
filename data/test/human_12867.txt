Markland Wood is a residential neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located west of the central core, in the former suburb of Etobicoke and is the westernmost residential community in Toronto along Bloor Street West. It's located on the border of Mississauga and bounded by Etobicoke Creek to the west, Elmcrest Creek to the east, Burnhamthorpe to the North, and surrounded by the Markland Wood Golf Club; approximately 2/3 is north of Bloor Street, and 1/3 south. Markland Wood is part of the Etobicoke Centre riding for federal and provincial governments and Ward 2 for the municipal council. History Markland Wood, or Mark's Land, was purchased by Mark Cavotti from the Silverthorn family in September 1958. Development started in 1960 after the Conservation Authority determined the high water mark levels after Hurricane Hazel. Most of the single family houses in Markland Wood were completed by 1967, but several custom-built homes were built around Markland Drive in the following years, as well as some tract housing at the north end of Thicket Rd. in 1971â€“1972. Two condominium apartment buildings were built along the west side of Mill Road, north of Markland Drive, in the mid- to late 1970s.

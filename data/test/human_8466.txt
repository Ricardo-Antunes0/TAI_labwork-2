Hope Africa University (HAU) was established in 2000 with support from the Free Methodist Church in Karen, Kenya. It relocated to Bujumbura in December 2003. At that time, it had 110 students. It is considered Burundi's best private university and receives the most applicants per year. HAU is the largest and fastest growing private university in Burundi with a peak enrollment of 1,700 students prior to civic disruption in 2015. Since 2015, enrollment has been gradually recovering with a large portion of the student body coming from surrounding Central African countries. HAU was presided by Sylvain Nzohabonayo until 2017 when Dr. Victor Barantota, (PhD Special Education), succeeded him as rector. In 2020 HAU was ranked 4th of 7 universities in Burundi by University Guru. Many of Burundi's religious, political and business leaders have attended HAU, including Denise Bucumi Nkurunziza, the wife of the former Burundi President Pierre Nkurunziza. HAU is a Christian liberal arts university in Bujumbura, Burundi. There are faculties of medicine, nursing, law, agriculture, amongst others. A school of dentistry has been planned and equipped, but as of 2020 is seeking faculty to oversee clinical didactic and practice supervision. Clinique Van Norman is a 100+ bed hospital with outpatient services established in 2012 as part of the HAU complex that provides quality acute and ambulatory care for a variety of patient populations, most notably obstetrics/gynecology and pediatrics. Board certified specialist physicians, teachers, and professors from the U.S., Canada, and other countries contribute to undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate preparation of generalist and specialist physicians.  Most intern and resident oversight is provided at the HAU-affiliated regional hospital at Kibuye.  The surgical residency at Kibuye Hope Hospital (KHH) is affiliated with the Pan-African Academy of Christian Surgeons' (PAACS) surgical residency program. Recognition by PAACS demonstrates the quality of HAU's surgical training program. KHH has operated both an inpatient and outpatient nutrition program that provides nutritious meals to high risk residents from the surrounding region.

Lilian Leveridge (15 April 1879 â€“ 1953) was a British-born Canadian teacher who became a writer, particularly of poetry, later in her career. In addition to six volumes of verse, she contributed articles, poems and short stories to various periodicals. Awards and recognition followed from the Canadian Literature Club of Toronto, Canadian Authors Association, and the McNab Poetry Award. Leveridge died in 1953. Early life and education Lilian Leveridge was born in England, at the "Park Farm", near Hockering, Norfolk, April 15, 1879. Reverses of fortune led her father, David William Leveridge (1840-1929), to remove to Canada in 1882. On 9 July 1883, Lilian, her mother, Anna Maria Godbolt Leveridge (1846-1927), and her six siblings (Edward, Arthur, Florence, Gertrude, Catherine, John) joined the father. The family settled in a one-room home on a  heavily timbered farm near Coe Hill, in the mining district of Wollaston Township, Hastings County, Ontario. Here, remote from church and school, for a time, she experienced the privations of pioneer life, but with the advantage of a refined home atmosphere and a devoted mother to guide her early education.

Saron, Aberaman was a Welsh Independent (Congregationalist) chapel in the town of Aberaman, Merthyr Tydfil, Wales. The chapel was consecrated on 26 October 1834 and had a seating capacity of 263. It closed in December 1985.  The chapel was originally built as a Unitarian place of worship, but later became affiliated with the Congregationalist denomination. The chapel was originally built on the site of a former chapel that had been destroyed by flooding in 1819. The chapel was designed by architect G. E. Street and cost Â£1,000 to build.  The chapel closed in December 1985 due to a decline in membership and financial difficulties. The building has since been demolished and replaced by a housing estate.

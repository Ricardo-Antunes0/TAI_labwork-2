Brazilians represent approximately 25% of the foreign population in Portugal, making them the second largest immigrant group after the Portuguese. Brazilians are well-integrated into Portuguese society and enjoy a good relationship with the Portuguese minority in Brazil.  Brazilians first began arriving in Portugal in the late 1960s as a result of the country's booming economy. Since then, the number of Brazilian residents has steadily increased, primarily due to Portuguese citizens returning to Brazil in search of employment. Today, there are around 350,000 Brazilians living in Portugal, making them the second largest immigrant group after the Portuguese.  Brazilians in Portugal typically find work in the agricultural, hospitality and construction sectors. In addition, many Brazilian residents have established businesses in Portugal's burgeoning tourism sector. Brazilians are also well-represented in academia, with a number of universities and colleges employing Brazilian faculty.  The Brazilian community in Portugal is vibrant and active, with a wide range of social and cultural organizations available to members. The Brazilian community is also well-integrated into Portuguese society, with relatively little tension between Brazilians and the Portuguese majority.

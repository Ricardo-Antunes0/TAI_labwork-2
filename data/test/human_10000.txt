Described as "a magazine of new writing in Zimbabwe", Tsotso (1989–2001) was published with a mandate to undermine the continued colonial domination of literature. It sought to create a platform where a new generation of Zimbabwean writers could give expression to their experiences through writing and create new contexts for the discussion, criticism and dissemination of their work. History Tsotso emerged from an initiative in 1989, when Baobab Books held a workshop for young and beginner at Ranche House College in Harare. The magazine bypassed traditional channels such as academics and foreign institutes, Tsotso′s editorial team - T. O. Mcloughlin, F. R. Mhonyera, M. Mahiri, S. Nondo and H. Lewis - put out a call for submissions in popular mass media publications such as Parade and The Herald in 1990. The result was a flood of submissions, many by first-time writers with little or no experience. "This is encouraging," read the editorial response in the second issue of Tsotso, "but a note of caution or at least advice is necessary to the young writer." This statement set the tone for what would become the magazine's strong pedagogic praxis.

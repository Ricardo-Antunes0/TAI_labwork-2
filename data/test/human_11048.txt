Earl James "Joaquin" Murphey (often spelled "Murphy", 30 December 1923 in Hollywood, California â€“ 25 October 1999) was an American lap steel guitarist. Nicknamed "Joaquin" by bandleader Spade Cooley to refer to the San Joaquin Valley, Murphey was the cutting edge lap steel guitarist of his time due to his clean legato playing and "innovative" chordal style. He was discovered by Cooley in 1943 and was a member of Cooley's organization on and off for the next decade.  He also worked with Tex Williams and the Western Caravan, a band formed in 1946 by Cooley's former vocalist and a number of his musicians.  Murphey also recorded with the western band Andy Parker and the Plainsmen. Music historian Andy Volk described Murphey as "a jazz musician disguised as a cowboy". He had a long-lasting friendship with inventor and guitar hardware manufacturer Paul Bigsby, who custom-built at least three lap-steels for him (a standard, a double neck and even a three neck model).

Beatrice Ann Wright (born Beatrice Ann Posner December 16, 1917 – July 31, 2018) was an American psychologist known for her work in Rehabilitation psychology. She was the author of a seminal work on disability and psychology, Physical Disability—A Psychological Approach (1960) and its second edition, retitled Physical Disability—A Psychosocial Approach (1983). Personal life  Wright was born Beatrice Ann Posner along with her twin brother Sidney in Richmond, New York, on December 16, 1917. Her parents, Jerome and Sonia Posner, were Russian immigrants whose egalitarian and humanistic views later influenced her academic work. The family had a Jewish heritage that Wright said did not profoundly affect her worldview or formative years, but which probably influenced her parents’ avid commitment of equality and justice. From her parents’ perspective there were two ways to resolve an injustice: "One way is to justify the situation. The other way is to do something about the injustice". In high school Wright was expelled from the honors society for distributing leaflets in support of the janitors’ strike, but was reinstated at her mother's demand. She died in July 2018 at the age of 100.

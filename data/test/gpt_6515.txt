Schizotheriines are one of the two clades of the lizards, the other being the amphisbaenians. Schizotheriines are found in Africa, Europe and Asia.  Schizotheriines are a group of lizards that share a common ancestor about 155 million years ago. The two main clades of schizotheriines are the schizotheriines, which include all African and European species, and the amphisbaenians, which include all Asian species.  The schizotheriines are typically smaller than the amphisbaenians, and have more slender bodies. They have smooth skin, with small scales on their head, neck and limbs. Some species have a ridge down the center of their back.  The schizotheriines are mainly carnivorous, eating small animals such as insects and spiders. They often hunt by waiting in ambush for their prey.

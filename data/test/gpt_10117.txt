The mercury-in-glass or mercury thermometer was invented by the French scientist and astronomer Jean-Baptiste-Marie Amiot in 1775. The thermometer consists of a glass cylinder filled with mercury, which is sealed at one end by a capillary tube. When the surrounding temperature is known, the position of the mercury can be ascertained by noting the position of the shadow cast on the wall of the capillary tube.

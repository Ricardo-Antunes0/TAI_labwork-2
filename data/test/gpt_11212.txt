Suzhousaurus (meaning "Suzhou lizard") is a genus of basal sauropodomorph dinosaurs from the Early Cretaceous of China.  The type species is Suzhousaurus liangi, described in 2001 by Ji Qiang, Zhao Xingxing, and You Xing. It is one of the earliest known sauropodomorphs and was one of the first dinosaurs known from the Lower Cretaceous Jiagou Formation in China. It is distinguished from other basal sauropodomorphs by its short tail, long neck, and large head.  All known specimens were found in the Jiagou Formation, which is dated to about 122-119 million years ago. The genus is named for Suzhou, a city in eastern China.

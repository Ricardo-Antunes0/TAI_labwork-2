Adaptive Standing Tennis is a modality of tennis for individuals with physical disability who play the sport of tennis standing, or ambulatory as opposed to their counterparts who play wheelchair tennis, playing tennis in a wheelchair. People who play adaptive standing tennis may have an amputation, cerebral palsy, limb difference, or hemiplegia. Adaptive standing tennis can be played either competitively or for recreation. The newly emerged form of tennis allows individuals with physical disabilities the opportunity to choose whether to play tennis ambulatory or in a wheelchair.

Enzo Amadei Jerez of Santiago, Chile is the founder of the TAP Foundation and TAP WORLD Tour. TAP is the Spanish acronym for Tennis Adaptivo de Pie. Translated from Spanish to English as playing from the foot up, or Standing Adaptive Tennis.

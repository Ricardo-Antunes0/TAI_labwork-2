Tianqi porcelain or ko sometsuke refers to a type of fine glaze porcelain made in the Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China during the 17th century. The term "tianqi" is derived from the name of the then Grand Master of the Jingdezhen kilns, Tianqi Ce.  The distinctive feature of Tianqi porcelain is its deep blue-green glaze, which is achieved by adding a small amount of copper to the kaolin clay during the firing process. This results in a blue-green colour that is not found in other types of porcelain. The translucency and softness of the glaze also make Tianqi porcelain popular for use as tableware.

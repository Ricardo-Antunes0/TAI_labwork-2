Jaime Semprún (26 July 1947 – 3 December 2002) was a Spanish-born Catalan artist, sculptor, and writer.  Semprún was born in Madrid, Spain on 26 July 1947. He studied at the School of Fine Arts of the University of Barcelona, where he obtained his degree in 1971. After spending a year in Paris, Semprún moved to Barcelona in 1972 and continued his studies at the Centre National d'Art et de Culture Georges Pompidou.  Semprún's early works were sculptural installations that combined traditional materials like wood, bronze and clay with new media like video and light. His first major exhibition was at the Palau de la Musica Catalana in 1979. In the 1980s, Semprún began making paintings that focused on the relationship between people and nature. His 1993 series called "El Jardín" is a well-known example of this work.  Jaime Semprún died from a heart attack on 3 December 2002 in Barcelona at the age of 54.

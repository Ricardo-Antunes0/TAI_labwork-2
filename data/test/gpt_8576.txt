The Rosenstrasse protest on Rosenstraße ("Rose street") in Berlin, Germany, was an event held on December 10, 1989, where students and members of the public protested the closing down of the East German Communist Party's youth organisation, the Young Communist League.  The protest began as a peaceful demonstration against the decision to close down the Young Communist League, but quickly turned into a public outcry against the émigré government of unified Germany. The Rosenstrasse protesters were met with pepper spray and tear gas by police, and around 100 were arrested.

Serangoon MRT station is an underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) interchange station on the North East (NEL) and Circle (CCL) lines. Situated in Serangoon, Singapore along Upper Serangoon Road and Serangoon Central, the station is integrated with the Nex shopping complex and the Serangoon Bus Interchange. The station is near the Serangoon Neighbourhood Police Centre and Braddell Heights Community Hub and serves various residential estates in the area. Preliminary studies for the NEL in the late 1980s included a tentative line alignment serving the Serangoon area. The station was confirmed in 1996; its construction involved the erection of the road viaduct above Upper Serangoon Road. In October 1999, it was announced that the station would interchange with the CCL. The NEL station was completed in June 2003. During the construction of the CCL tunnels, ground settlement caused the NEL station to sink, leading to a brief halt in excavation works. The CCL platforms opened in May 2009 as part of Stage 3 of the CCL.

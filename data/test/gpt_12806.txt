The physiology of decompression involves a complex interaction between the body's gas exchange and compression systems.  The gas exchange system is responsible for exchanging air and oxygen with the surrounding environment. The respiratory system is responsible for moving air in and out of the lungs, while the cardiovascular system transports blood to all parts of the body. The skeletal muscles are responsible for moving the body and its fluids.  The body's compression system regulates the amount of pressure inside the body. It does this by controlling the flow of blood and lymph through the circulatory system, as well as the volume of fluid inside and outside of cells.

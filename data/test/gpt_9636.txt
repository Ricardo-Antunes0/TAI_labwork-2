Marchmont Estate lies near the village of Marchmont in the Scottish Borders. The estate was originally part of the Marchmont Priory, founded by David I in the 12th century. The priory was secularised in 1539, and the estate passed through a number of hands until it was sold to the Marquess of Bute in 1802.   The estate remained in the Bute family until 1973, when it was bought by a consortium consisting of educational institutions and individuals. The estate is now a public school and visitor centre.

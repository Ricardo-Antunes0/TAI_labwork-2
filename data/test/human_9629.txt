Nat(h)an Friedland was a rabbi and member of the H'bat Tsion (Coming of Zion) movement, one of the fathers of the movement for settling the Land of Israel. He grew up in Taurig, (also spelled Towrig and TauragÄ—) Lithuania in the early decades of the 19th century and died in Jerusalem in 1883. He became one of the most prolific Zionist writers of the H'bat Tsion movement in the mid-1800s. He was one of several writers and thinkers of the 19th century created the intellectual basis for a new Jewish state. Friedland's collected writings, including his most popular work, "Der Cos", were translated from the Yiddish to modern Hebrew. All these publications are in Hebrew except the Jewish Encyclopedia article which is in English. Friedland was among the forerunners of Zionism in the early 19th century, including Judah ben Solomon Alkalai,  and Zvi Hirsch Kalischer who saw a messianic message in the return to Zion.

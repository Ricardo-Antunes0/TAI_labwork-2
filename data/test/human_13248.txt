Richard Hatherill (20 September 1769 â€“ 1804) was a British Royal Navy officer who served during the French Revolutionary War. Born in Queenborough, Kent, on 20 September 1769, he is recorded as having first served aboard  from September 1783. He passed his lieutenant's examination in 1790 and joined  in that capacity on 18 October 1794. It was aboard this ship that he became embroiled in the Nore Mutiny in 1797. Hatherill and other loyal members of the crew were able to retake the ship and bring her in under heavy fire from the other mutinied ships. In 1800, the ship he was serving on was wrecked on the French coast and crew captured. Hatherill was later released in an exchange of officers. As a lieutenant, Hatherill commanded the bomb vessel,  which took part in the bombardment of Kronborg and Trekroner in March and April 1801 respectively. He was promoted to post captain following the Peace of Amiens but does not appear to have gone to sea again. By October 1804, Hatherill had become severely ill and died shortly after at the age of 35.

The International 2017 (TI7) was the seventh iteration of The International, an annual Dota 2 esports world championship tournament. Hosted by Valve, the game's developer, the tournament began with the online qualifier phase in June 2017, and ended after the main event at the KeyArena in Seattle in August. The Grand Finals took place between the European-based Team Liquid and Chinese-based Newbee, with Liquid defeating Newbee 3â€“0 in a best-of-five series, winning nearly $11 million in prize money. As with every International from 2013 onwards, the prize pool was crowdfunded by the Dota 2 community via its battle pass feature, with the total being one of the largest in esports history at nearly 25 million. Other relevant events took place during the tournament, including a cosplay competition and submitted short film contest with their own independent prize pools. In addition, the first demonstration game of what later became the OpenAI Five, bots trained to defeat high-skill players of the game entirely through machine learning, was played live during the event.

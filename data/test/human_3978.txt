The trap–bath split (also – split) is a vowel split that occurs mainly in southern accents of English in England (including Received Pronunciation), in New Zealand English, Indian English and South African English and also to a lesser extent in Australian English and Welsh English as well as older Northeastern New England English (notably, older Boston accents) by which the Early Modern English phoneme  was lengthened in certain environments and ultimately merged with the long  of father. In that context, the lengthened vowel in words such as bath, laugh, grass and  chance in accents affected by the split is referred to as a broad A (also called in Britain long A).  Phonetically, the vowel is  in Received Pronunciation (RP); in some other accents, including Australian and New Zealand accents, it is a fronter vowel ( or ) and tends to be a rounded and shortened  in Broad South African English. A trap–bath split also occurs in the accents of the Middle Atlantic United States (New York, Baltimore, and Philadelphia accents), but it results in very different vowel qualities to the aforementioned British-type split. To avoid confusion, the former is usually referred to in American linguistics as a 'short-a split'. In accents unaffected by the split, words like bath and laugh usually have the same vowel as words like cat, trap and man: the short A or flat A. Similar changes took place in words with  in the lot–cloth split.

Squawk Box is an American business news television program that airs from 6 to 9 a.m. Eastern time on CNBC. The program is co-hosted by Joe Kernen, Becky Quick, and Andrew Ross Sorkin. Since debuting in 1995, the show has spawned a number of versions across CNBC's international channels, many of which employ a similar format. The program title originates from a term used in investment banks and stock brokerages for a permanent voice circuit or intercom used to communicate stock deals or sales priorities; it also may refer to the squawk of a bird, like a peacock, which is the logo of CNBC. Format Dubbed "our pre-game show" by regular co-host Joe Kernen, Squawk Box features early-morning analysis of and breaking news from the financial markets, along with considerable banter between the hosts and their guests – original host Mark Haines stressed the need to "inject a little fun" into business news in the early morning. Another distinctive and long-running feature of the show has been its use of daily "guest hosts" – figures from the world of business and politics who join the team for much of the broadcast, questioning guests as well as offering their own opinions.

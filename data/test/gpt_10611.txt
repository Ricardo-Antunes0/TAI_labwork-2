Cube mold technology (also known as Rotating Core Molding or Rotary Core Molding) is a thermoforming process in which a mold is filled with an edible thermoplastic material that is heated to a high temperature and then rotated. This rotational action causes the material to be forced into the many small holes in the mold, which is then cooled to solidify the plastic. The finished product typically looks like a cube or a block.

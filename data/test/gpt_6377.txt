Finite state machines (FSMs) are widely used in control and robotics systems, and are also used in low-power devices. FSM synthesis is a technique for designing and synthesizing FSM circuits.  FSMs are an important part of modern control systems, as well as a wide range of low-power devices. They can be found in things like robotic arms and servo motors, as well as various types of sensors. FSM synthesis is a technique for designing and synthesizing FSM circuits. This can be useful for creating custom circuits that are specific to a particular application, or for creating robust designs that can be easily modified.

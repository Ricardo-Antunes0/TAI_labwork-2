Severe Tropical Cyclone Waka (Fiji Meteorological Service designation: 18F) formed on March 10th, 2017, in the South Pacific Ocean. The storm rapidly intensified into a Category 5 hurricane on March 12th, before making landfall on Fiji on the same day as a massive Category 4 storm. After crossing the island, Waka rapidly weakened and made a second landfall on Vanuatu on March 15th. The storm quickly dissipated on March 17th over open water.  Waka was the most powerful storm to hit Fiji since Cyclone Winston in 2015, causing significant damage and loss of life. In all, Waka killed at least 44 people and left tens of thousands homeless. Waka is also responsible for significant damage to infrastructure and crops across Fiji.

Novo Brdo Fortress ( / Tvrđava Novo Brdo/; ) is a medieval fortress in the municipality of Novo Brdo, in southeastern Slovenia. The fortress is located on the south side of the Krka River, about 4 kilometres from the town of Novo Brdo. The site is protected by the National Park of Slovenia.  The first fortification on the site was erected in the late 12th century by the Counts of Gorizia and Gradisca. It was destroyed in 1253 by the Mongols and rebuilt in 1274 by King Louis I of Hungary. The present fortification was built in the early 15th century by Emperor Sigismund III and enlarged by John Zápolya in 1525. It served as a refuge for the local population during the Siege of Trieste (1521-1522). It was captured by Venice in 1527 and passed to Austria after its victory in the Battle of Mohács. In 1797 it was captured by French forces during the War of the Second Coalition, but was restored to Austria after its victory at Austerlitz.   The fortress played an important role during World War II as a stronghold of the Partisans. It was captured by Axis forces on 2 October 1944 and remained under German occupation until it was liberated on 9 May 1945. After the war it was used as a military garrison until it was closed down in 1992. The fortress is now open to visitors and is managed by the Ministry of Defence.  Novo

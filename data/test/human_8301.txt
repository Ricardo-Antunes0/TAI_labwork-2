The Tägermoos is an area of 1.54 km2 (380 acres) in Thurgau, Switzerland, wedged between the outskirts of the German city of Constance and the core village of the Swiss municipality of Tägerwilen.  It lies on the south bank of the Seerhein.  In the east, it borders the district Paradies of Constance.  In the south-east, it borders the district Emmishofen of the municipality of Kreuzlingen. The remarkable status of Tägermoos was fixed in 1831 by a treaty which is still in force today.  Under this treaty, the area is part of Switzerland at the state level and part of the Swiss municipality of Tägerwilen.  However, certain administrative tasks are exercised by the German city of Constance, in accordance with Thurgau municipal law.  Other tasks are exercised by the authorities of Tägerwilen.  In particular, land survey is the responsibility of Constance, making Tägermoos a  of the city of Constance.

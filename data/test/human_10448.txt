Ero Fernández (died  926) was a Galician magnate, count in Lugo, grandfather of St. Rudesind, and ancestor of several noble Galician and Portuguese lineages who married into the highest ranks of the nobility of the kingdoms of León and Castile. Biography  His filiation has not been documented; from his patronymic it is known that his father was named Fernando and the presence of another count at court named Diego Fernández, ancestor of a powerful family in northern Portugal, has led to the two being viewed as powerful brothers. Count Ero lived during the reigns of Alfonso III and his successors and held the title of count from the end of the 9th century and the first decades of the following century. His presence in the curia regia of King Alfonso is confirmed in a charter issued by the king on 30 September 899 when he donated several villages in the territory of Coimbra to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela.

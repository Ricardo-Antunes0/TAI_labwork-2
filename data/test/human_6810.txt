Chhath is an ancient Hindu festival historically native to the Indian subcontinent, more specifically, the Indian state of Bihar along with West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and the southern parts of Nepal. It has become popular with the Nepali hilly community in the recent years, thanks to the influence of southern immigrants. Prayers during Chhath puja are dedicated to the solar deity, Surya, to show gratitude and thankfulness for bestowing the bounties of life on earth and to request the granting of certain wishes.  Chhathi Maiya, the sixth form of Devi Parvati and Lord Surya's sister, is worshipped as the Goddess of the festival also Called Ranbay Maay in Mithila. It is celebrated six days after Diwali, on the sixth day of the lunar month of Kartika (Octoberâ€“November) in the Hindu calendar Vikram Samvat. The rituals are observed over four days. They include holy bathing, fasting and abstaining from drinking water (vrata), standing in water, and offering prasad (prayer offerings) and arghya to the setting and rising sun. Some devotees also perform a prostration march as they head for the river banks.

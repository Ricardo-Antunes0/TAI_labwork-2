Angolan nationality law is regulated by the Angolan nationality law of 1967. The law defines Angolan nationality and sets out the conditions under which a person may acquire Angolan nationality. Individuals who do not possess Angolan citizenship are not authorized to reside in Angola or carry out any official duties.  Angolan nationality is based on descent from a citizen of Angola or from one of the countries that constituted the Portuguese Empire at the time of the person's birth. Nationals of Portugal, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Mozambique are all considered Angolan citizens. Angolan nationals who were born outside of Angola but have at least one ancestor who was an Angolan citizen at the time of their birth are also considered citizens. Children born to an Angolan national and a foreign national are not automatically granted Angolan citizenship.  A person may lose Angolan nationality if they renounce their citizenship or if they are absent from Angola for more than five years without obtaining a permit from the Minister of Interior. Angolan nationals who are convicted of a serious crime or who are found guilty of treason against the state may also lose their citizenship.  Angola has a dual citizenship law which allows nationals of countries with which Angola has a bilateral agreement to maintain their citizenship and retain their rights and obligations under that agreement while also retaining their Angolan citizenship.

Llanwenarth House is a small country house, formerly a hotel, located off the B4246 road, west of Govilon and Llanfoist, just south of Abergavenny in the Usk valley of Monmouthshire, Wales. It was built in the late 16th century, although the drawing room and some of the furnishings are from the Georgian period. History The exact date of the building of the house is unknown, although there are title deeds dated to 1602 for the house. In the 17th and 18th century the house was known to be owned by the Morgan family. Dassie Morgan mentioned the house in her will, dated October 7, 1620, which also requested the repair of the nearby Llanwenarth Bridge. The house was originally known as Ty-mawr, "the great house", a common designation in the county. In the late 18th century, Joshua Morgan occupied the house, while serving as High Sheriff of Monmouthshire. James Humfrey, a graduate of Trinity College, Oxford came into possession of the house in 1862 on the death of his mother Lucy Morgan, the last descendant of the Llanwenarth Morgans, and the house remained in the Humfrey family for the next two generations. Around 1946 the house was purchased by Brigadier William Albany Fetherstonhaugh and sold following his death in 1947.

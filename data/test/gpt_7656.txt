An amorphous metal transformer (AMT) is a type of electronic transformer that can accommodate high-frequency currents and voltages. AMTs are made of a metal alloy with a low melting point, which allows the metal to flow like a liquid and achieve a crystalline structure only when it is cooled to a temperature below its melting point. This makes the metal less susceptible to damage from high-frequency currents.

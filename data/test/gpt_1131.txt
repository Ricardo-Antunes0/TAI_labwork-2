There are two notable Ipswich Hoards (which are not to be confused with the Ipswich Town hoard), both of which are collections of Anglo-Saxon artefacts. The first, known as the Ipswich Hoard, was discovered in 1878 and consists of over 700 items, including jewellery, weapons, and a number of rare manuscripts. The second, known as the Bury St Edmunds Hoard, was discovered in 1967 and contains over 1,200 items, including objects made of gold and silver, jewelry, and a number of religious manuscripts.  The Ipswich Hoard is one of the most significant Anglo-Saxon hoards to have been found, and is currently on display at the Museum of London. The Bury St Edmunds Hoard is also highly significant, and includes a number of objects that are unique in terms of their age and type.

Crestwood Court (formerly known as Westfield Shoppingtown) is a large shopping mall located in the south-west of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It is situated on the corner of Ipswich Road and Ipswich North Road, opposite the Ipswich Regional Council offices.  The shopping centre was opened in 1988 and was developed by property developer Frank Lowy and his son Harry Lowy. The centre features more than 150 stores, including major national and international retailers such as Myer, Target, Kmart, JB Hi-Fi, Big W and Woolworths.  In January 2012, it was announced that the centre would be rebranded as Crestwood Court, with a new $50 million makeover expected to be completed by early 2013. The redevelopment will see the opening of a new food court, an expanded cinema complex, new luxury fashion boutiques and an upgraded waterpark.

Golbadan Baji  was a concubine (and later, wife) of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, King (Shah) of Qajar Iran from 1797 to 1834. Of Georgian origin, she was originally a slave girl of Fath-Ali Shah's mother, Mahd-e Olya, after whose death, she rose to prominence. Biography Fath-Ali Shah's mother Mahd-e Olya had been responsible for running the household until her death. When she died, Fath-Ali Shah's wives were unable to choose a new head of the royal harem, and therefore requested Fath-Ali Shah to leave Golbadan Baji in charge of the household as she was reportedly familiar with the ways of her mistress. By choosing a concubine, Fath-Ali Shah's wives protected themselves from the perception of favouring one wife over another. Golbadan Baji therefore became head of the household pursestrings. According to contemporaneous sources, she fulfilled this task efficiently and with fidelity. Fath-Ali Shah was very impressed by Golbadan Baji's performance, and therefore married her as a sigheh, and gave her the honorific title (laqab) Khazen-ol-Dowleh.

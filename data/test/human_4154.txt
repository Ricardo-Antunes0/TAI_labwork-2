Until We're Dead is the debut studio album by ska-punk/anarcho-punk band Star Fucking Hipsters. It was released in 2008 on Fat Wreck Chords. Background Leftöver Crack vocalist Stza and drummer Brandon Chevalier-Kolling were the original creators of the punk rock supergroup Star Fucking Hipsters. The band went on hiatus following Brandon’s untimely death. Stza eventually reunited with another former Leftöver Crack member, drummer Ara Babajian, along with friend Frank Piegaro of The Degenerics to reform the group. With the addition of female vocalist Nico de Gaillo of Another Dying Democracy and bassist Yula Beeri of World Inferno Friendship Society they crafted their full-length album in early 2008. According to Stza, the album was to be originally titled "Allergic To People". The album was recorded and mixed by Ryan Jones at The Wild Arctic in Queens, NY and additionally mixed by Stza and Jamie McMann at Motor Studios in San Francisco, California during the early half of June that year. It was eventually released by independent record label Fat Wreck Chords on September 30, 2008.

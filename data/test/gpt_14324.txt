The lunitidal interval measures the time lag between two successive lunar phases. It is the time it takes for the moon to go through one full orbit around the Earth.  The lunitidal interval is measured in days, weeks, or months. It can be calculated using the following formula:   where T is the current date, P1 and P2 are the dates of the first and second lunar phases, and Î» is the lunar lunitidal interval in days.

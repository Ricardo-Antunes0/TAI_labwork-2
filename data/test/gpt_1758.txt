Art in General was a non-profit contemporary art museum located in the Southbank Centre in London, England. It was founded in 1984 by art collector and entrepreneur Charles Saatchi and his wife, Louisa. The museum was closed permanently in November 2013.  The Southbank Centre announced the closure of Art in General on 25 October 2013, after its then-director, Barbara Rose, resigned citing a "fundamental change in the market" for contemporary art.   Art in General was founded by art collector and entrepreneur Charles Saatchi and his wife, Louisa. The museum opened its doors to the public in 1984 with an exhibition of works by David Hockney. In its early days, Art in General was one of London's most cutting-edge galleries, presenting exhibitions that were at the forefront of contemporary art practice. In addition to exhibiting work by major artists of the day, Art in General also championed new talent and helped to launch the careers of some of Britain's most acclaimed artists today.   In recent years, however, Art in General has found it increasingly difficult to secure exhibitions that reflect the diversity and dynamism of contemporary art practice. This has led to a decline in visitor numbers, which has made it increasingly difficult for the museum to finance its operations. Consequently, Art in General has decided to close its doors permanently as of 25 November 2013.

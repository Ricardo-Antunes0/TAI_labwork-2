Prince Karel of Schwarzenberg (, born 10 November 1937) is a Czech politician who served as President of the Czech Republic from 1993 to 2003.  Prince Karel Schwarzenberg was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on 10 November 1937. After completing his secondary education at the Charles University in Prague, he studied law at the University of London. He returned to Czechoslovakia in 1964 and worked as a lawyer before becoming involved in politics.  He entered the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic's political arena in the early 1960s, joining the reform-minded liberal Democratic Party (ČSLD). He was quickly promoted through the party ranks, and served as deputy minister of justice (1981–1983) and minister of transport (1983–1986). In 1986, Schwarzenberg resigned his government posts to run for president of Czechoslovakia. He defeated incumbent Gustáv Husák with 52% of the vote.

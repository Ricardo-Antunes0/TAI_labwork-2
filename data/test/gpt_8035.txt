Hanford Mills Museum, also known as Kelso's Mill, is a restored waterwheel-driven flour mill located in the town of Kelso, Scotland. The mill was built in 1792 by James Kelso, who also established Kelso Grammar School. The mill has been restored to its 18th century condition and is now open to the public as a museum.  The waterwheel was built by James Kelso in 1792 and is the oldest surviving waterwheel in Scotland. It is still in working order and can be seen turning slowly on the ground floor of the museum. The mill was used to grind flour for local farmers until it was closed down in 1984. It was then restored by the Kelso Mills Museum Trust and reopened to the public in 1992.

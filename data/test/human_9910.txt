Shah  was a title given to the emperors and kings of Iran (historically known as "Persia" in the Western world). It was also adopted by the kings of Shirvan (a historical Iranian region in Transcaucasia), namely the Shirvanshahs, and by the Khwarazmshahs. The title was also used by Persianate societies, such as the rulers and offspring of the Ottoman Empire, the Kazakh Khanate, the Khanate of Bukhara, the Emirate of Bukhara, the Mughal Empire, the Bengal Sultanate, various Gurkha rulers, and historical Afghan dynasties. In Iran proper as well as in the Greater Iran region, the title saw continuous usage. Rather than "king" in the European sense, each Iranian ruler regarded himself as the Shahanshah  or Padishah  of the Persian Empire. Etymology The word descends from Old Persian xšāyaθiya "king", which used to be considered a borrowing from Median, as it was compared to Avestan xšaθra-, "power" and "command", corresponding to Sanskrit (Old Indic) kṣatra- (same meaning), from which kṣatriya-, "warrior", is derived. Most recently, the form xšāyaθiya has been analyzed as a genuine, inherited Persian formation with the meaning 'pertaining to reigning, ruling'. This formation with the "origin" suffix -iya is derived from a deverbal abstract noun *xšāy-aθa- 'rule, ruling, Herrschaft, from the (Old Persian) verb xšāy- 'to rule, reign'. The full, Old Persian title of the Achaemenid rulers of the First Persian Empire was Xšāyaθiya Xšāyaθiyānām or (Modern Persian) Šāhe Šāhān, "King of Kings" or "Emperor". This title has ancient Near Eastern or Mesopotamian precedents. The earliest attestation of such a title dates back to the Middle Assyrian period as šar šarrāni, in reference to the Assyrian ruler Tukulti-Ninurta I (1243–1207 BC).

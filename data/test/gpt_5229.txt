HMAS Napier (G97/D13) was an N-class destroyer of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). She was commissioned in 1977 and served until 1987. After a lengthy refit at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, Sydney, she was transferred to the Kenyan Navy in February 1990 and renamed KIS Nairobi (D14). The ship was decommissioned in November 2003 and sold for scrap in August 2006.  Napier was one of the most modern destroyers of her time, incorporating features such as a state-of-the-art fire control system and Harpoon anti-ship missile launchers. Her career saw her participate in numerous peacekeeping operations, including Operation Palliser in Namibia and Operation Relex in the Gulf of Aden. She also played a significant role in the suppression of the 1989 Melbourne riots.  HMAS Napier has been the subject of several books, including Terry McDonell's highly acclaimed book "HMAS Napier: A History" (1989), which was made into a television documentary series "HMAS Napier" which aired on Network Ten from 1996 to 1997.

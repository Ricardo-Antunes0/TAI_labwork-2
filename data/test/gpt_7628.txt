Idelson is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southwest part of the Moon. It is named after Hungarian-born American astronomer Edward Emerson Idelson. The crater is wider than it is deep, and has a relatively gentle rim that is not markedly curved. The interior floor is relatively featureless, with only a few tiny hills and ridges marking its surface.  Idelson was first observed by the Apollo 10 mission during its orbit of the Moon in October 1969. It was mapped by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2009 and named for Edward Emerson Idelson, an American astronomer and professor at Harvard University who specialized in lunar research.

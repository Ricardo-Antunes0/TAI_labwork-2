Bertil Gustafsson (born 1939) is a Swedish artist. He is known for his paintings, sculptures, and installations.  Gustafsson was born in 1939 in the town of Luleå, Sweden. He studied art at the University of Stockholm, where he worked with professors such as Nils Torp and Karl-Henrik Åhlin. Gustafsson's early work was figurative and often concerned with the human body. However, over time his work has become more abstract, often using light as a central motif. His installation "The Mirror" (1982), for example, consists of a large mirror that reflects light onto a series of panels below it, creating a constantly changing light and shadow show.  Gustafsson has exhibited his work throughout Europe and North America, and his pieces are in the collections of institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. He currently lives and works in Stockholm.

John Z. Kiss (born 1960) is an American biologist known for his work on the gravitational and space biology of plants. Kiss is dean of the College of Arts & Sciences at the University of North Carolina Greensboro. Previously, he was a professor of biology and dean of the Graduate School at the University of Mississippi. and distinguished professor and chair of the botany department at Miami University. He has worked with NASA since 1987 and served as principal investigator on eight spaceflight experiments on the Space Shuttle, the former Russian space station Mir, and on the International Space Station. His research focuses on the sensory physiology of plants in space. He received the NASA Outstanding Public Leadership Medal in 2014. In 2021, Asteroid Kiss 8267 was named in his honor, a recognition that coincided with his receipt of the 2021 COSPAR International Cooperation Medal. His international collaboration on a spaceflight project with NASA and the European Space Agency has led to the discovery of novel sensory mechanisms in plants. Education  Kiss received his Bachelor of Science degree in biology from Georgetown University. and a Ph.D. in botany and plant physiology from Rutgers University in 1987. His doctoral work focused on biosynthesis of the storage carbohydrate paramylon in the alga Euglena. From 1987–1990 Kiss conducted post-doctoral work on gravitropism in plants at Ohio State University, where he was first introduced to NASA-related research. His first funded project, on gravity perception and response mechanisms, was as a NASA research associate at the University of Colorado at Boulder from 1990–1991.

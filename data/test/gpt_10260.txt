Julia Catherine Beckwith (March 10, 1796 â€“ July 5, 1849) was an American author and poet.  Born in Charleston, South Carolina, Beckwith was the daughter of a wealthy planter. She received her early education at home and then attended the Female seminary in Charleston. After graduating in 1814, she moved to Philadelphia to study law, but abandoned the profession after only a few months and turned to writing.  Beckwith's first published work was a poem entitled "The Progress of Error" (1816). Over the next few years she published several short stories and poems, including "The Wasp" (1817), "The Bee" (1818), and "The Cricket" (1820). In 1824 she married James Beckwith, a lawyer and politician. The couple had two children before separating in 1829.  Beckwith returned to writing full-time in 1830 and achieved considerable success with her novels, most notably "Rosalie" (1831) and "Eleanora" (1836). She also wrote occasional poetry pieces and travelogues. Beckwith's final novel, "The Heir of Redclyffe" (1847), was not well received by critics and failed to sell well. Beckwith died in Philadelphia six years later at the age of 58.

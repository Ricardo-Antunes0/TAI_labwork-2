EuFOD is the chemical compound with the formula Eu(OCC(CH3)3CHCOC3F7)3, also called Eu(fod)3.  This coordination compound is used primarily as a shift reagent in NMR spectroscopy.  It is the premier member of the lanthanide shift reagents and was popular in the 1970s and 1980s. Structure and reactivity Eu(fod)3 consists of three bidentate acetylacetonate ligands bound to a Eu(III) center.  This metal atom has an electron configuration of f6. The six electrons are unpaired—each in a different singly-occupied f-orbital—which makes the molecule highly paramagnetic.  The complex is a Lewis acid, being capable of expanding its coordination number of six to eight.  The complex displays a particular affinity for "hard" Lewis bases, such as the oxygen atom in ethers and the nitrogen of amines.  It is soluble in nonpolar solvents, even more so than related complexes of acetylacetone and hexafluoroacetylacetone.  The fod ligand is a derivative of heptafluorobutyric acid.

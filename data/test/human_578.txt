The Duddingston Loch Hoard, currently held by National Museums Scotland (NMS), comprises Late Bronze Age weapons and other objects which were found in Duddingston Loch in Edinburgh when workers were dredging for marl in 1778.  The bronze objects were found along with human bones and animal horns.   The hoard was originally dispersed between King George III, Sir Alexander Dick, who owned the loch, Sir Walter Scott, and the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland (now NMS). The donation to the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland included spearheads, swords, a rapier, and a bucket handle.  More swords and one further spearhead were acquired by the museum in 1935.  These had been in the collection of Sir Walter Scott.  The spearheads and swords are broken and/or bent, and some have been burnt and partially melted. Types include Ewart Park swords, plain and lunate spearheads, barbed and lunate spearheads, and a ring with staple from a bucket.  The hoard dates to around 1000-800 BC.  A Scottish parallel for the treatment of the metalwork at Duddingston Loch is found in the Peelhill Hoard from South Lanarkshire, in the collections of Glasgow Museums.

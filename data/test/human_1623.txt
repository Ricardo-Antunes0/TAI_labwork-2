Gwent is a preserved county and former local government county in southeast Wales. A county of Gwent was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972; it was named after the ancient Kingdom of Gwent.  The authority was a successor to both the administrative county of Monmouthshire (with minor boundary changes) and the county borough of Newport. In forming the county of Gwent the act explicitly resolved the previously somewhat ambiguous status of the latter two authorities, in terms of whether they were a part of Wales or England. Under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, the county of Gwent was abolished on 1 April 1996. However, the name remains in use for one of the preserved counties of Wales for the ceremonial purposes of Lieutenancy and High Shrievalty, and its name also survives in various titles, e.g. Gwent Police, Royal Gwent Hospital, Gwent Wildlife Trust and Coleg Gwent. "Gwent" is often used as a synonym for the historic county of Monmouthshire â€“ for example the Gwent Family History Society describes itself as "The key to roots in the historic county of Monmouthshire".

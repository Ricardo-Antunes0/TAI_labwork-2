Windows Internet Explorer 8 (IE8) is a web browser for Windows. It was released by Microsoft on March 19, 2009, as the eighth version of Internet Explorer and the successor to Internet Explorer 7. It was the default browser in Windows 7 (later default was Internet Explorer 11) and Windows Server 2008 R2 and can replace previous versions of Internet Explorer on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 but unlike version 7, this version does not support Windows Server 2003 SP1 or an earlier version. Internet Explorer 8 is the first version of IE to pass the Acid2 test, and the last of the major browsers to do so (In the later Acid3 Test, it only scores 24/100.). Additionally, it introduced a compatibility mode to optionally emulate older versions' rendering behaviour, and colour-coded tab groups where links opened in new tabs share the colour of which they originated from. According to Microsoft, security, ease of use, and improvements in RSS CSS, and Ajax support were its priorities for IE8.

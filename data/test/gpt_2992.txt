Point-to-point construction is a non-automated method of constructing communication links between two or more points. The method is most commonly used in broadcast and telecommunications networks.  Point-to-point construction typically uses a pair of transmission lines, each with an end station at one end and the other end connected to a central office or repeater. The network administrator assigns an address to each end station, and sets up the lines so that data is transmitted from the transmitter at one end to the receiver at the other.

The first USS Trepang (SS/AGSS-412) was a Balao-class submarine launched on 24 October 1941 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard. The boat was commissioned on 12 March 1942 with Lieutenant Commander W.D. Taylor in command.   The Trepang's first patrol was conducted in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands, and she returned to Pearl Harbor on 31 May 1942. The submarine departed Pearl Harbor again on 16 July 1942 and operated in the South Pacific Ocean until departing for the United States on 26 February 1944.   After a voyage via the Panama Canal and San Francisco, Trepang arrived at Pearl Harbor on 10 May 1944. She operated out of that port for the remainder of World War II, making three more patrols in the South Pacific - from 5 to 9 November 1943; from 21 to 25 February 1944; and from 5 to 10 March 1944.   On her last war patrol, Trepang destroyed two enemy shipping vessels, a tanker and a destroyer, before returning to Pearl Harbor on 17 September 1944. The submarine departed Hawaii for the United States once more on 17 December 1944, arrived at San Diego on 7 January 1945, and operated out of that port until decommissioning on 18 March 1945.   USS Trepang was struck from the Navy list on 25 March 1945 and sold for scrapping in August 1946.

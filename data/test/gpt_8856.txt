Sanat is the third album of Finnish power metal band Nightwish. It was released on 30 September 2003 through Century Media Records.  The album is a concept album based on the Hindu epic poem, the Mahabharata. The story is about a war between two branches of a royal family, the Kauravas and the Pandavas. Sanat tells the story from the point of view of Karna, one of the Kauravas.  The album was recorded at Finnvox Studios in Helsinki, Finland and produced by Nightwish and Tuomas Holopainen. It was mastered by Jens Bogren at Fascination Street Studios in Stockholm, Sweden.  Sanat debuted at number one on the Finnish albums chart, selling over 15,000 copies in its first week. The album has since been certified platinum by the Finnish Ministry of Culture.  The song "I Wish I Had an Angel" was featured in EA Sports' 2006 video game NHL 06.

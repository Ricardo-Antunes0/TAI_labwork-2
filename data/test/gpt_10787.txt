Abū Naṣr ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAlī al-Sarrāj (Arabic: أبو نصر عبد الله بن علي السراج, c. 980 – 1040) was an Islamic jurist and theologian who lived in the Fatimid Caliphate. He is best known for his work on Islamic law, tafsir, and fiqh.  Sarrāj also played a significant role in the development of mathematics in medieval Islam. He was one of the earliest Muslim mathematicians, and is credited with the development of algebra, arithmetic, and geometric algebra. He also made contributions to astronomy and trigonometry.  Born in Egypt, Sarraj studied Islamic law under two of the most eminent legal scholars of his time - al-Shafiʿi and al-Qarafi. He also developed a close relationship with al-Maqrizi, who taught him a great deal about mathematics. In 1027, Sarraj moved to Baghdad where he became one of the most influential authorities on Islamic law. He also became involved in theological debates and was frequently called upon to adjudicate disputes between Muslims.  Sarraj died in Baghdad in 1040. His legacy has been preserved through his numerous works on Islamic law and theology as well as his contributions to mathematics and astronomy.

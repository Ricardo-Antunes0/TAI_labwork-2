The Kalakai Sanctuary is an ancient structure located on the island of Maui in Hawaii. The sanctuary is made up of a network of trails that wind through a lush rainforest.  The Kalakai Sanctuary was first inhabited by the ancient Hawaiian people and was used as a sacred site for worship. The sanctuary later became a place where the ali ªi (chiefs) could escape from the chaos of everyday life. Today, the Kalakai Sanctuary is a popular tourist destination and is home to many rare and endangered plant and animal species.

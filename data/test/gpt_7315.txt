The Kanheri Caves (Kānherī-guhā [kaːnʱeɾiː ɡuɦaː]) are a series of Buddhist and Jain carved caves located in the city of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. They are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The caves are located on a rocky outcrop overlooking the Arabian Sea, about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) west of the Mahim Creek. The Buddhist and Jain carvings date from the 1st century BCE to the 5th century CE and include representations of monks, nuns, deities, and fantastical creatures. The caves are among the most extensive and best-preserved examples of rock-cut Buddhist art in India.

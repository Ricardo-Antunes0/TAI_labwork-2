Cork Gully was a British insolvency practice, which operated in the early to mid-1990s.  The practice was started by four partners, including Nicholas Levene and Peter Golding, who left their previous practice, Brown Rudnick. Cork Gully specialised in restructuring debt portfolios, and employed a number of financial consultants. The practice was acquired by BP in 1996.

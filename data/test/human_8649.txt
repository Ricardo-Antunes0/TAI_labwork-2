John Gunthorpe (died 1498) was an English administrator, Clerk of the Parliament, Keeper of the Privy Seal and Dean of Wells. Education and career Gunthorpe was a student at Cambridge University and had already entered into clergyship and received holy orders. By private appointment he served as a secretary to Queen Elizabeth.  By 1452 he was Master of Arts at Cambridge University and served as a junior proctor in 1454â€“5. Gunthorpe traveled to Italy and was in Ferrara in August 1460. He had been attending the lectures of Guarino da Verona on rhetoric at Ferrara.  His teacher Guarino died at the end of 1460 and this may be why Gunthorpe moved on.  In January 1462 Gunthorpe was formally taken into papal service.  Pope Pius II examined Gunthorpe for fitness, and appointed him as a papal chaplain and minor penitentiary in St Peter's Basilica and in the Papal Curia.  From 1460 to 1465, Gunthorpe went through a period of post-graduate study in Italy, where he perfected his Latin rhetorical style.  He also learned Greek and presumably Italian, and gained experience in the international arena of the papal court.

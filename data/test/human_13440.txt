Mr. Steak was an American steakhouse restaurant chain started in 1962 by James A. Mather in Colorado Springs, Colorado. At its peak, the chain operated 278 restaurants throughout the United States. The chain saw a decline in the 1980s when it attempted to diversify its menu options, drawing focus away from the steak in favor of fish, salads, and chicken. History In June 1981, Richard S. Jackson replaced James C. Shearon as president and chief operating officer of the Denver-based Mr. Steak Inc. while James A. Mather continued as chairman and chief executive officer. At the time of the announcement, there were 258 Mr. Steak restaurants, most of them franchised. Jackson was later replaced as president and chief operating officer by Michael T. Fuller in September 1984. After acquiring nearly $2 million in debts, Littleton-based Jamco Ltd., the parent firm of the Mr. Steak restaurant chain, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At the time of the filing, Randall Pike had replaced Mathers as chairman and CEO and the company had 122 franchise Mr. Steak restaurants and the 25 company-owned operations in 36 states and Canada. The company incurred an enormous debt by "co-signed leases with a lot of franchise operators that didn't make it."

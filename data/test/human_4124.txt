Arthur Franklin Willmer (10 January 1890 – 20 September 1916) was an English first-class cricketer and British Army officer. Willmer was born at Claughton to Arthur Washington Willmer, a JP and cotton broker, and his wife Janet Mary Willmer (née Cooper). He was educated at the nearby Birkenhead School, where he played cricket for four years, captaining the college in his last two. From Birkenhead he went up to Brasenose College, Oxford to study law on an open scholarship. While studying at Oxford, Willmer made one appearance in first-class cricket for Oxford University against the Free Foresters at Oxford in 1912. He batted twice during the match, ending each innings unbeaten on 5 and 7 respectively. He bowled ten overs across the match with his right-arm fast bowling, conceding 36 runs. After graduating, Willmer passed both of his intermediate and final exams to be called to the bar. He played minor counties cricket for Cheshire in 1914, making two appearances in the Minor Counties Championship.

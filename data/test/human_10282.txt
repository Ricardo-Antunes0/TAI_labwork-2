Polyphlebium venosum, the veined bristle-fern or bristle filmy fern, is a fern in the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is only found in wet forests, mainly growing as an epiphyte on the shady side of the soft tree fern, Dicksonia antartica.  It also grows on logs, trunks of trees and rarely on trunks of Cyathea species or on wet rock-faces. It is found in the wetter parts of  Eastern Australia and New Zealand. P. venosum has poor long-distance dispersal compared to other ferns due to its short lived spore. Notable features of Polyphlebium venosum include it being one cell layer thick, 5–15 cm in length, having many branching veins and a trumpet shaped indusium. Description  The sporophyte stage has rhizome branched and creeping, very fine, densely covered with tiny, pale brown hairs. Fronds well spaced, pendent, 5–15 cm long, delicate and translucent; stipe and rachis thread-like. Lamina pale green, long and narrow, irregular in outline and simply lobed to pinnately divided; pinnae sometimes very long and hanging almost parallel to main rachis, lower pinnae often very small and widely spaced. Margins of pinnae or segments wavy or broadly crenate; ultimate segments blunt and broad (2–6 mm); veins prominent and repeatedly forked. Sori marginal and immersed, borne singly on short lateral lobes near base of pinna; indusium narrowly trumpet-shaped, 2–4 mm long; fine receptacle projecting 10 mm or more.

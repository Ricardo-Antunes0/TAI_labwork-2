Werling v. Sandy, 17 Ohio St. 3d 627, is a case in which the Ohio Supreme Court held that a municipal ordinance prohibiting soliciting on public streets within the city limits of Columbus was constitutional under the First Amendment.  The case arose from the actions of Rudy Werling, who was arrested for soliciting a donation from a passerby on the steps of the Ohio Statehouse. The ordinance at issue prohibited solicitations within the city limits, and Werling argued that this prohibition violated his First Amendment rights. The Ohio Supreme Court upheld the ordinance in a unanimous decision, ruling that the municipality had a legitimate interest in protecting its citizens from harassment and intimidation by solicitationists.

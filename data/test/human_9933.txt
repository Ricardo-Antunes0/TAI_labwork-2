Explorer 37, also SOLRAD 9 or Solar Explorer-B, was a NASA satellite was one of the SOLRAD (Solar Radiation) program that began in 1960 to provide continuous coverage of solar radiation with a set of standard photometers. Explorer 37 was a spin-stabilized satellite oriented with its spin axis perpendicular to the Sun-satellite line so that the 14 solar X-ray, and ultraviolet photometers pointing radially outward from its equatorial belt viewed the Sun on each revolution. Data were transmitted in real time by means of an FM / AM the satellite's telemetry system and recorded in a core memory that read out its contents on command. Individual scientists and institutions were invited to receive and use the data transmitted on the 136-MHz telemetry band on the standard Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) channels 3 through 8. For the period of July 1971 to June 1973, the core memory data of Explorer 44 (SOLRAD 10) were used rather than those from Explorer 37 (SOLRAD 9). The Explorer 44 (SOLRAD 10) core memory failed on 11 June 1973, and Explorer 37 (SOLRAD 9) was heavily used until 25 February 1974, when the gas supply of the attitude control system was exhausted. Lacking attitude control, Explorer 37 (SOLRAD 9) was operationally useless and was turned off. Launch  Expkorer 37 was launched on 5 March 1968, at 18:28:00 GMT, from Wallops Flight Facility (WFF), of the LA-3, Virginia, with Scout B launch vehicle.

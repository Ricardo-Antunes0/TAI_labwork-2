The Wiz, also known at times as The Magic Store, is a chain of department stores in the United States. The first store was opened in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1921 by A. C. Green and operated as a general store.  The Wiz was founded by Alfred C. Green (1893-1981) in 1921 as a general store in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The store was forced to close during the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921, but reopened the following year with new leadership and moved to a new location on Greenwood Avenue.  In 1937, The Wiz opened its first full-line department store on East 14th Street in downtown Tulsa. The store grew rapidly, and in 1957 it opened a second store on North Peoria Avenue. In 1966, The Wiz acquired the Roy Wilkins Department Store in Washington, D.C., which added an expanded apparel and accessories section to its retail mix.  In 1984, The Wiz acquired the Kress Store chain of six stores in Southern California; this added a range of women's clothing and accessories to the retailer's mix. In 1990, The Wiz merged with Shop 'n Save of Omaha, Nebraska to form The Great American Group Inc., which operated more than 150 stores across nine states at the time of the merger.  As of 2016, there are 23 stores remaining under the The Wiz name: 16 in Oklahoma and 7 in Texas (with one store each in Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico and Utah).

Kepler-39b (formerly known as KOI-423b), is a gas giant exoplanet that was discovered by NASA's Kepler spacecraft on May 15, 2017. Kepler-39b is the first planet located beyond the so-called habitable zone of its parent star, Kepler-39, and the first confirmed transiting planet beyond the habitable zone of a sun-like star. The planet is also the first confirmed planet beyond the so-called "Goldilocks zone"â€”a distance from its star that is not too close to where water could exist on the surface but not too far where it would be too cold.

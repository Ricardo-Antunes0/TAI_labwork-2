The Kitab al-Bulhan , or Book of Wonders, or Book of Surprises, is a mainly 14th-century Persian manuscript compiled – and possibly illustrated – by Abd al-Hasan Al-Isfahani.  The codex was probably bound during the reign of Jalayirid Sultan Ahmad (1382-1410) at Baghdad, and includes texts on astronomy, astrology, geomancy and a section of full-page illustrated plates dedicated to each discourse topic, e.g. a folktale, a sign of the zodiac, a prophet, etc. History of manuscript The calligrapher, copiest and compiler was , whose family came from Isfahan in Iran and himself was a native of Baghdad, where he studied the Aristotelic "demonstrative"  sciences. It seems the Kitab al-Bulhan was commissioned by – or the idea of –  (originally of Irbil near Mosul in northern Iraq), who sold it to  in Dec. 1409 – Jan. 1410. The original codex comprised a series of treatises, which came apart, and when sections were reassembled and some lost, it became jumbled and incoherent. The work includes extracts copied from the Kitab al-mawalid ("Book of Nativities") of the astronomer and neo-Platonist Abu Maʿshar al-Balkhi (787–886 CE) of Balkh (modern-day Mazar-i Sharif) in northern Afghanistan.

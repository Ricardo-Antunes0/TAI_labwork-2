Seston can simply be defined as the particles suspended in bodies of water such as lakes, oceans, ponds, rivers, etc. The term seston applies to plankton, organic detritus, and minerals. Detritus is dead organic material and a mineral is a solid chemical compound. Small particles of seston may be formed by the breaking down of larger particles. This can happen by the crashing of waves, mixing of water currents, or by slow disintegration. Most seston in the water is made up of a combination of both organic and inorganic compounds. The inorganic compounds are from mineral origin and are essentially particles of mud suspended in the water column. The organic compounds are from biological origin and can be either living or dead. Seston is used by many species in their day to day activities. Some examples are Barnacles, mussels, scallops, corals, sea anemones, sea squirts, and sea cucumbers. Suspension feeders and filter feeders like whales also rely on seston as a food source. Nutrient-rich seston particles can support the local ecosystem by providing nutrition to organisms. The higher the amount of organic matter in the seston, the more nutritious it is for the suspension feeders who count on seston as a food source. Many of these animals have adapted to be able to eat both organic and inorganic seston. Animals that eat seston also have to adapt because the seston is not always present or may have periods of time when it is less nutritious. They adapt by eating more when it is there or by storing it to eat later when it would otherwise be unavailable. Studies of rivers have shown that downstream seston is more nutritious that it is upstream.

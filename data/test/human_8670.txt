Pjetër Zarishi or Dom Pjeter Xarishi (1806 in Blinisht, Zadrima – 1866 in Kallmet, Lezhë) was an Albanian Mirditë Catholic priest and poet who established a tradition of the 19th century Catholic literature in northern Albania. He is also noted for his literary contribution to the Albanian National Awakening. His poems were primarily religious and in less extent secular. Life Zarishi was born on February 16, 1806 in Blinisht, a village in Zadrima, back then part of Ottoman Empire. He was educated at the training college of the Propaganda Fide. He was first appointed as a secretary of the Italian bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sapë in  Nënshat, in the Shkoder Archdiocese who was transferred to Orosh and appointed as abbot of the remote Abbey of Orosh after one disagreement with bishop of Sapa. Zarishi and Dotmaze from Shkoder were assistants of Karlo Krasnik, a Catholic priest. In Orosh Zarishi initially maintained a close cooperation with local Mirdite leaders and particularly with Dod Bib Pasha.

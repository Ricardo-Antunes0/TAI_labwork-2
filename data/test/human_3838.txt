Aliki Kelihiano Kalolo, is a Tokelauan politician who served as the Head of the Government of Tokelau, or Ulu, from February 2012 to March 2013, again from 12 March 2019 to 9 March 2020, and again from 8 March 2021. He is a member of the Council for the Ongoing Government of Tokelau, serving as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Education, Economic Development, Natural Resources and the Environment, prior to and then simultaneously to his leadership of the government. The office of Ulu rotates on an annual basis between the faipule of each of the country's three atolls; Kalolo, as faipule of Atafu, took office as Ulu for the first time in 2012. As Ulu, he oversaw the replacement of Tokelau's old ship, the MV Tokelau, which was considered no longer to be safe and seaworthy, with the newer, custom-built PB Matua, provided by New Zealand. In June 2012, Kalolo sacked his Minister for Transport, Foua Toloa, over the latter's insistence that the MV Tokelau was still seaworthy, and New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully's indication that the New Zealand government could not work with Toloa. Toloa's portfolios (Finance, Telecommunications, Energy and Transport) were taken over by the Ulu.

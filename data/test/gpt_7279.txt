Degree may refer to: As a unit of measure, a degree is a fraction of a circle with its diameter equal to one full circle. As a unit of angular measure, it is the angle at which one line of longitude intersects another line of longitude. It is also the angle subtended by a perpendicular from the center of a circle to its circumference. Degrees are also used in mathematics, engineering and other fields.   In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, degree programs may involve three years of full-time study after which students may be awarded a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, or Bachelor of Engineering degree. In other countries, such as the United States, degree programs may involve four years of full-time study after which students may be awarded a Bachelor of Science or a Bachelor of Engineering degree.

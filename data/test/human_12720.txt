Mary Caroline Blair or Mary Caroline, Duchess of Sutherland born Mary Caroline Mitchell (1848 â€“ 27 May 1912) was a United Kingdom scandalous duchess who broke convention and went to jail for interfering in her husband's will. She was nickname "Duchess Blair" but she was the Duchess of Sutherland. The Duke had been one of the richest people in Britain and Carbisdale Castle was built for her as a consolation prize when the dispute was settled. Life Blair was born in Oxford in 1848 to Richard Michell principal of Hertford College, Oxford, and his wife Amelia Blair. She had one brother - Arthur Mitchell.  In 1872 she married Arthur Kindersley Blair, formerly a Captain in the 71st Highland Light Infantry. He had resigned his commission in 1861 and was then employed as land agent and business manager by George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 3rd Duke of Sutherland, who was one of the richest people in Britain, owning 1.4 million acres of land and Stafford House, a mansion in London. The Queen visited Stafford House and was known for noting that Stafford House was more of a palace than her own home. Mary Blair became the Duke's mistress and when in 1883 her husband died in a shooting accident there was speculation that it was suicide or murder, although the official verdict was accidental death. The affair continued after her husband's death, but in 1889 she caused a scandal when she and the Duke married only four months after the death of the Duke's estranged wife. This broke the convention that widowers should not remarry for a year and it went against written advice to the Duke from Queen Victoria. Blair now had a high rank in British society but she was not welcome at any society event.

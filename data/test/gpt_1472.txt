Ido  is a constructed language, derived from Esperanto and Ijekavian, and created in the 1930s by Ludwik Zamenhof. It is designed to be easy to learn and to be expressive enough for everyday use as a second language.  Ido is spoken by around 1,000 people worldwide, mostly in Israel, Argentina, and Sweden.

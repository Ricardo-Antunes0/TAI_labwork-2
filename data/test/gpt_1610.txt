Neil Ralph Charter MacLaurin (born 22 March 1951) is a Scottish mathematician and Professor of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. He is known for his contributions to the theory of partial differential equations and functional analysis, as well as for his work in mathematical physics.  MacLaurin was born in Glasgow, Scotland, on 22 March 1951. He studied mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, where he received his doctorate in 1976. After postdoctoral research at the University of Maryland, he became a faculty member at the University of Edinburgh in 1978. He is currently Professor of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh.  MacLaurin's research focuses on the theory of partial differential equations and functional analysis, as well as mathematical physics. His work has had a significant impact on these fields, and has led to new insights into phenomena such as turbulence and chaos. He has also made significant contributions to the field of combinatorics, particularly in the area of Ramsey theory.  MacLaurin is a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the American Mathematical Society. He was elected to the Acad√©mie des Sciences in 2006.

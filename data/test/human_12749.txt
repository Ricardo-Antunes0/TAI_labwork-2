The Great Iwan  was a monumental throne hall located within the Citadel in Cairo, Egypt. It was built by the Mamluk sultan Al-Nasir Muhammad in the early 14th century and was considered one of the most impressive structures in the city at the time. It fell slowly into ruins over several centuries before being demolished by Muhammad Ali in 1825 to make way for the present-day Mosque of Muhammad Ali and other constructions. Name The Great Iwan was also known as the Iwan al-Nasiri ("Iwan of al-Nasir") or the Dar al-'Adl ("Hall of Justice"), the latter name deriving from its use as a venue for the dispensation of the sultan's justice. Although the Great Iwan was a large domed structure, which in Arabic is more typically called a qubba, both qubba and iwan were terms that were used to denote monumental throne halls during the Mamluk period. The term iwan is used elsewhere to denote a vaulted hall open on one side, a feature prominently used throughout Islamic architecture, especially in regions of Iranian influence. In Cairo, however, the term seems to have been increasingly used for secular architecture in the late 13th and 14th centuries, while the term qubba was reserved for funerary architecture. Al-Nasir Muhammad's structure was thus called an iwan even though its main element was a domed hall, not a vaulted hall.

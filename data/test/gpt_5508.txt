Venom is a 2018 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the first installment in the Spider-Man: Homecoming sequel trilogy, and was written and directed by Ruben Fleischer.  Tom Hardy stars as Eddie Brock / Venom, a disgraced journalist who gains superpowers after being injected with an experimental serum from a lab run by Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), a shady businessman and former colleague of Peter Parker's. The film also features Michelle Williams, Woody Harrelson, and Jenny Slate as Brock's fellow journalists.  Development of Venom began in early 2017, with Sony Pictures initially considering Michael Fassbender to portray the lead role before Hardy was cast. Principal photography began in July 2017 in Atlanta, with additional filming taking place in London and Los Angeles. The film was screened for critics at the 2018 San Diego Comic-Con International, where it received mixed reviews; however, it was commercially successful, grossing over $800 million worldwide.  Venom is set after the events of Spider-Man: Homecoming and features many elements from that film; however, it is not a sequel or prequel. A Silver Sable film is also in development.

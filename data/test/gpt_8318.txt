The Ramsdell Theatre is a historic playhouse located at 703 West 46th Street in midtown Manhattan, New York City. Designed by architect Theophilus P. Dwyer and built in 1892, it is a prominent example of Romanesque Revival architecture.  The Ramsdell Theatre originally opened as a vaudeville house on February 12, 1892 with the play "A Fool There Was" starring comedian Harry Houdini. The theatre was renamed the Ramsdell Theatre after its original owner, George Ramsdell, who died in December 1893. In 1910, it was leased by the Shubert Organization and became one of their flagship Broadway theatres. The theatre was closed in 1966 and subsequently abandoned. It was subsequently renovated and reopened as a live theater in 1978. The theatre has been operated by the Roundabout Theatre Company since 1995.

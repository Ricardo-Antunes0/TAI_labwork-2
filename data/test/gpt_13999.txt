Palazzo Mozzi or Palazzo de' Mozzi is a palace located on the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy. It was built in the early 16th century by Girolamo Mozzi, a wealthy merchant. The palace is now used as the headquarters of the University of Venice.  The Mozzi Palace overlooks the Rialto Bridge and is close to the Doge's Palace. It is one of the most important palaces in Venice, and it is home to several art collections. The building was severely damaged in World War II, but has since been restored.

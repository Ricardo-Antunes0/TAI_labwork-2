Deir Hajla is the Arabic name of the Greek Orthodox Monastery of Saint Gerasimus (officially the Holy Monastery of Saint Gerasimos of the Jordan). It is located on the West Bank, west of the River Jordan and north of the Dead Sea. Etymology The current official name of Holy Monastery of Saint Gerasimos of the Jordan connects it with the 5th-century monastic leader who introduced the lavra, or laura type of community among the hermits of the Desert of the Jordan. (The rendering of the saint's name with the suffix -us instead of the original Greek -os is due to the practice of Latinisation of names.) The actual monastery founded by Gerasimus, probably at a site closer to the spring of 'Ein Hajla than the modern monastery, was abandoned towards the end of the 13th century after the final defeat of the Crusaders. The neighboring monastery at the site of Deir Hajla is thought to have inherited its name, itself becoming the "monastery of Gerasimus". A recent publication mentions this name also being used in Arabic, Deir Mar Gerasimus, 'St. Gerasimus Monastery'.

The DrugWipe is a test used to wipe surfaces for traces of drug residue. It may also be used for sweat or saliva testing of individuals. Law enforcement at the roadside can quickly screen  suspected drivers of being under the influence of an illegal drug by using the DrugWipe. DrugWipe was named a finalist in the 2011 Cygnus Law Enforcement Group Innovation Awards competition.  The DrugWipe 6s (saliva only) test was entered under the category of 'Traffic Enforcement'. Operation The test is accomplished by wiping a small moist wiping fleece on a surface, or on the forehead, palm, or tongue of an individual. An integrated ampule is then broken which acts as the medium for transporting the collected analyte to the antigen binding site. The DrugWipe can be configured to detect cannabis, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, MDMA, and benzodiazepines.  Immunoassay strips containing antibodies bind to components of the different drugs.

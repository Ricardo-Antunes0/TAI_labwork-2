Bogra Khan Ilak was an ethnic Turkish Muslim ruler of the Bengal subcontinent from 1575 to 1607.  Ilak was a son of Kadir Khan, the sultan of Bengal. He succeeded his brother Islam Shah as ruler of Bengal in 1575. Ilak faced numerous rebellions, including one led by his nephew Sikandar Shah in 1578. Ilak defeated Sikandar Shah and his allies at the Battle of Jamuna River in 1578, and consolidated his power by punishing those who had supported Sikandar Shah. Ilak also strengthened relations with the Mughal Empire, which had been growing in power in India.  Ilak's reign was marked by military campaigns against rebel groups and by efforts to expand the territory under Muslim rule. He unsuccessfully attempted to conquer Bishnupur in 1598, and unsuccessfully attempted to capture Diamond Harbour in 1600. Ilak's death in 1607 caused a period of political instability in Bengal.

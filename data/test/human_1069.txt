Stockeld Park is a Grade-I listed country house and estate situated between the towns of Wetherby and Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England, which is now the home of Peter (a great-grandchild of Robert John Foster) and Susie Grant. The estate spans some 2,000 acres and broadly covers the area between Wetherby and the villages of Spofforth and Sicklinghall.   In addition to traditional activities including farming and properties, Stockeld Park is also home to Yorkshire's largest Christmas tree plantation, with some 500,000 Christmas trees in the ground.  It is perhaps best known for its Adventure Park, a seasonal attraction with a range of indoor and outdoor activities that vary by season. In winter for example there is: ice skating, cross-country skiing, an Enchanted Forest, Santa's Grotto and a giant, snowflake-shaped yew tree maze. Other seasons offer adventure playgrounds, boating, pedal go-karts, motorised scooters and a range of themed events.

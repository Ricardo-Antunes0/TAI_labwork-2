Forest degradation is a process in which forests are degraded by the removal or alteration of the natural environment that supports them. This can be caused by human activities such as deforestation, land use change, and fragmentation.   Forest degradation can have a number of harmful consequences for forests and the people who live in or depend on them. Degraded forests tend to be less productive, more susceptible to fire, and host a greater variety of pests and diseases. They can also reduce water availability and quality, create negative environmental impacts such as noise and air pollution, and contribute to climate change.   There is currently no single solution to forest degradation. However, concerted efforts by governments, communities, and conservationists can help restore degraded forests and protect them from further degradation.

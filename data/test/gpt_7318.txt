Joseph Francis Fitzgerald (6 February 1912 â€“ 15 May 1982) was an Australian politician who served as the 25th Premier of Victoria, from 1965 to 1969.  Fitzgerald was born in Melbourne to Irish immigrants, William Fitzgerald and Mary Nellie O'Keeffe. After attending Catholic schools, he commenced work as a labourer in 1933. In 1939, he married Kathleen Mary O'Brien; they had two children. In 1943, Fitzgerald enlisted in the Australian Army, serving in the New Guinea campaign and later in Italy. He was discharged in 1946 with the rank of lieutenant colonel.  Returning to Melbourne, Fitzgerald worked as a labourer and union organiser until he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for the Labor Party at the 1955 state election. He became deputy leader of the Labor Party under Premier Leo McLeay in 1958 and led Labor to victory at the state election later that year. As premier, Fitzgerald implemented a range of social reforms, including funding for education and health care, establishment of the Victorian Equal Opportunity Board and creation of Victoria's anti-discrimination laws. He resigned as premier in 1969 after losing a motion of no confidence by the Labor caucus; he was succeeded by John Cain.  Fitzgerald retired from politics in 1973 and died two years later at age 70. He is remembered for his efforts to improve social conditions in Victoria during his time as premier and for his outspokenness on political issues.

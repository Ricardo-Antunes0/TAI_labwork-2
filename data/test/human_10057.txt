John B. Macy (March 25, 1799 â€“ September 24, 1856) was a U.S. Representative from Wisconsin. Macy was born in Nantucket, Massachusetts, where he received a liberal education. He moved to New York City in 1826 and later in that year to Buffalo, New York. He resided in Cincinnati, Ohio from 1842 to 1845. Macy was one of the founders of Toledo, Ohio, and one of the proprietors of the Rock River Valley Union Railroad (the state line to Fond du Lac, Wisconsin). This line was the beginning of the Chicago and North Western Railway. Macy moved to Fond du Lac in the Wisconsin Territory, in 1845 and engaged in the real estate business, acquiring land from Philip Hone, the mayor of New York City. Several street names in Fond du Lac, such as Macy Street, are named for Macy and members of his family. He moved with his family to the town of Empire, Wisconsin, near Lake de Neveu, in 1850. Macy's home, built near what became Highway 45, still stands. Its original outbuildings include a hexagonal library.

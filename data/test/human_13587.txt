Disco in Dream is the debut concert tour by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue. Although headlined by Minogue, the tour was an ensemble show alongside fellow Stock Aitken Waterman acts Sinitta and Dead Or Alive and supported her first two studio albums, Kylie (1988) and Enjoy Yourself (1989). The tour took place in Asia, later travelling to Europe re-titled as 'The Coca-Cola Hitman Roadshow' with a different line up of PWL and Stock Aitken Waterman artists such as Big Fun and Sonia. The shows were free to "thank British fans for their support" and targeted towards fans under the age of 18. It is likely that during the Disco in Dream tour, the relationship between Kylie and INXS lead singer Michael Hutchence began. Michael reportedly owned an apartment in Hong Kong and, following previous flirtations at industry events Michael successfully managed to seduce the singer. Kylie ended her relationship with Jason Donovan soon afterwards.

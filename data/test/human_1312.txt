The China Initiative was launched by the United States Department of Justice, the FBI, and other United States federal agencies in November 2018. It is led by the United States Department of Justice National Security Division and has been described as a "sweeping effort" to counter Chinese espionage in American businesses and research by eliminating spies and halting the transfer of information and technology to China. In addition, the China Initiative focuses on safeguarding "critical infrastructure against external threats through foreign direct investment and supply chain compromises, as well as combatting covert efforts to influence the American public and policymakers without proper transparency." There is no definition of what a China Initiative case is. It has been criticized as being ineffective, racially biased and disproportionate. Some of the cases under the initiative were based on false evidence by the FBI. The China Initiative's end was announced on 23 February 2022 citing perceptions of unfair treatment of Chinese Americans and residents of Chinese origin. Origin According to the U.S. DOJ, the China Initiative "reflects the strategic priority of countering Chinese national security threats and reinforces the President’s overall national security strategy." It was launched against the background of findings concerning China's practices and in March 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative announced the results of an investigation into China's trade practices under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The investigation concluded, "among other things, that a combination of China’s practices are unreasonable, including its outbound investment policies and sponsorship of unauthorized computer intrusions." It proposed that "[a] range of tools may be appropriate to address these serious matters."

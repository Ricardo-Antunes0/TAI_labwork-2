"Two Times Blue" is a song recorded by Deborah Harry, released as the first single from her fifth solo album Necessary Evil. It became an international success within the Dance genre. Composition "Two Times Blue" is a pop rock song with a length of three minutes and fifty-eight seconds. In the verses, Harry responds to a lover who accuses her of being a "two timer" and "Miss Calculation", in turn defending herself and singing that she "can't give up — I love you through and through". The song's chorus, which has been described as catchy, has been described as being "oddly romantic", consisting of the lyrics "Well maybe I could’ve been better/Yeah, maybe I’ve been kind of bad/But I know, oh yes I know/You’ll be two times blue if I go". Musically, the song has been described as having a "guitar-fueled-meets-beatbox template", while Harry's vocals have been called "rough around the edges". The song's radio edit made more extensive use of synthesizers and deemphasize Harry's vocals; it's also longer than the original version, with a length of four minutes and twenty-nine seconds.

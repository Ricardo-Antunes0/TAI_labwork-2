Lichine (foaled 5 May 1979) was an American-bred, French-trained Thoroughbred racehorse who sold for a record-setting $1.7 million ($ million inflation adjusted) as a yearling in 1980. Although he never threatened to repay his auction price, he was a useful racehorse, winning the Listed Prix de Suresnes as a three-year-old and finishing placed in several Group races. Background Lichine was a "smallish, wiry" bay horse bred in Maryland by Mrs. J. Getty & Carelaine Stables. He was from the sixth crop of foals sired by Lyphard, an American-bred stallion who raced in France, winning the Prix Jacques Le Marois and Prix de la ForÃªt in 1972. Lyphard went on to become a very successful breeding stallion in both Europe and North America, siring Three Troikas, Dancing Brave and Manila. His dam, Stylish Genie was a minor stakes winner and a half-sister to Artaius, a Kentucky-bred colt who won the Eclipse Stakes and the Sussex Stakes in 1977.

Nadine Gelineau was a Canadian-born music industry executive, radio programmer, and DJ, whose career spanned roles in Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, New York, and Los Angeles, at campus radio stations, the CBC, major and independent record labels, and VICE Media, before establishing her own multi-service music company The MuseBox. During the course of her career, she marketed and promoted acts including The Killers, the Wu-Tang Clan, Bloc Party, Guided By Voices, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, and Spiritualized, managed such artists as Echo & The Bunnymen, K-Os, and The Dears, and employed the former Smiths's bassist Andy Rourke as an A&R director at her company. She was known for tenaciously promoting emerging indie artists and being well liked by both musicians and executives. Early career Gelineau described her childhood as unconventional following her parents divorce at a young age which saw her absorb herself with 60s and 70s music, and decide in high school that she wanted to work in the music industry. In 1976 she joined Carleton University's newly established campus radio station CKCU-FM in Ottawa, Ontario, where she served as a radio host and guided the station's development while also DJing in local clubs. In 1989 Gelineau was recruited by the CBC's flagship program for alternative music, Brave New Waves, facilitating a move to Montreal where she also worked as the station manager at McGill University's CKUT-FM in the early 90s.

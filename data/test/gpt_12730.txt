République is an episodic action-adventure stealth video game developed by the French video game developer Quantic Dream and published by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. The game was announced at the PlayStation Media Showcase during the Paris Games Week on September 5, 2013.  République is an open-world action-adventure stealth video game set in a fictional Paris in the year 2084. Players take control of a female protagonist and explore the city in search of information and to prevent a revolution from occurring. The game features a nonlinear approach to storytelling, with players able to explore the city at their own pace and follow any number of side-quests or main missions.  The development of République began in early 2013, shortly after the release of Quantic Dream's previous game, Beyond: Two Souls. The team worked on the game for two years while also developing Heavy Rain and Detroit: Become Human. République was released in Europe on October 5, 2017, and in North America on October 11, 2017.

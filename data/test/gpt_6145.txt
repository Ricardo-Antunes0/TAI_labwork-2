Eucalyptus pantoleuca, commonly known as round-leaved gum, is a eucalyptus tree that is native to eastern Australia. It is a medium-sized tree, typically reaching a height of 3â€“5 m, with a smooth trunk and round, slightly flattened leaves. The flowers are white or cream-coloured and the fruit is a black, berry-like drupe.   The tree is used for its wood, which is particularly hard and durable, and its oil, which is used in manufacturing various products. Round-leaved gum is also the main source of natural rubber in Australia.

The collared sparrowhawk (Accipiter cirrocephalus) is a small, slim bird of prey in the family Accipitridae  found in Australia, New Guinea and nearby smaller islands. As its name implies the collared sparrowhawk is a specialist in hunting small birds. It is characterised by its slight brow ridges and slender feet. The last segment of their middle toe projects beyond the claws of the other toes. Description The collared sparrowhawk is 29–38 cm (tail about half ), with a wingspan 55–78 cm, the average male weighs 126 g, female 218 g. They are small, fierce, finely built with rounded wings, long square tail, yellow eyes and long legs.  Adults have slate-grey upper parts, sometimes with a brown wash, and a chestnut half collar. The underparts are finely barred rufous and white. The under wing and tail are finely barred. The cere is cream to olive-yellow, the eyes yellow and the legs and feet yellow. The sexes are similar in appearance but males are smaller than females. Juveniles have brown upper parts, with pale streaks on the head and nape, and fine rufous edges to the feathers of the back and wings. The under parts are white with heavy brown streaks on the breast and coarse brown barring on the belly.  The underwings and tail are finely barred.

Silvertown railway station was on the North London Line (NLL) serving the Silvertown area of east London, until the station and the eastern section of the line it was on were closed in 2006. It was situated between Custom House (now a Docklands Light Railway station) and , the eastern terminus of the line. Silvertown was opened in 1863 by the Great Eastern Railway, on the route of the former Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway, with two tracks and platforms. A decline in use of the line led to the removal of one of the two tracks in 1980, leaving just one platform to serve trains in both directions. North Woolwich was also reduced to one platform. After third rail electrification of the line in 1986 by British Rail, services were increased and the single-track section became a bottleneck. Prior to closure, the typical Monday to Saturday service frequency westbound towards  and eastbound towards North Woolwich was one train every 30 minutes during the daytime, increasing to one every 20 minutes in the evening; one train called every 30 minutes all day on Sundays.

The Manila Metrostars were a professional basketball team in the now-defunct Metropolitan Basketball Association from 1998 to 2001. The team was the 1999 MBA National Champions and holds the MBA record of winning 22 consecutive games during the said season. The team was merged with the Batangas Blades in the 2001 season. In 1998, the Metrostars played home games at numerous venues such as the Ninoy Aquino Stadium, the Ateneo Blue Eagle Gym, Rizal Memorial Coliseum and a host of others before playing permanently at the Mail and More Arena (now San Andres Gym). History In 1998, the Metropolitan Basketball Association was formed as a regional-based professional league which also challenged the commercial Philippine Basketball Association. The team made the biggest steal of all when they acquired Rommel Adducul straight out of the San Sebastian College - Recoletos. The team also had Alex Compton, an American citizen who was born in the Philippines. Others include ex-PBA veterans Peter Martin, Frechie Ang, Ruben Dela Rosa and former Far Eastern University star Nestor Echano.

Breta sögur (Sagas of the Britons) is a term used to describe the literature written in Old Norse by the Norsemen in what is now Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland.  The term "Breta sögur" was first coined by the Danish scholar J. P. Jacobsen in his 1876 work Historiae et origo Britanniae. Jacobsen applied it to a group of texts which he felt were descended from a common source, but which had been written in different languages and by different authors over a period of centuries. He did not use the term "Breta sögur" himself, but referred to these texts as the "Britannic sagas".  The first Breta sögur were probably composed in the 8th century AD, but it was not until the 12th century that they began to be collected and written down. The most famous of the early writers was Snorri Sturluson, who wrote three of the most famous Breta sögur: Heimskringla, Ynglinga saga and Egil's saga Víkingssonar. Other important writers of the era include Harald Fairhair, who is best known for his legendary career as king of Norway, and Anglo-Saxon historian Bede.

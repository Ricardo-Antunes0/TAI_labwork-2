Junior Pantherz (or JPZ) are a Canadian post-rock music group formed in 1999 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. The band is named after a Sloan song "Junior Panthers".  The Original band featured neighborhood pals Terry Mattson on Guitar/Vocals, and Arnold Van Lambalgen on Drums. In an eight-year span, the band released 5 CDs and a retrospective Vinyl LP collection entitled ...Discover Vinyl. JPZ are now mainly an inactive band, reappearing occasionally for one-off shows or friends' weddings. Gravitational Pull and Polar Opposites Schoolyard chum Corey Dahlen joined in early 1999 on Bass, effectively forming the Power Trio. They released their first E.P "Gravitational Pull" the same year. After a few local shows under their belt, the band released their first full-length Album "Polar Opposites" in 2000. It contained re-recorded songs from the first E.P, as well some new numbers. Both Polar Opposites and Gravitational Pull were limited to 50 copies, which were handmade by the band and sold out quickly.

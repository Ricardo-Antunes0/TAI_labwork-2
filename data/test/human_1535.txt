World of Warships is a free-to-play naval warfare-themed multiplayer online game produced and published by Wargaming and developed by its subsidiary Lesta Studio, following the earlier games World of Tanks and World of Warplanes. Players can battle others at random or play cooperative battle types against bots or an advanced player versus environment (PvE) battle mode. For the most skilled players, two seasonal competitive modes are also available. The free-to-play structure is of the "freemium" type. Significant progress can be made without purchasing anything, but access to higher levels of play and additional warships becomes progressively more difficult without financial investment.  World of Warships was originally released for Microsoft Windows in 2015. The computer version was followed by the iOS and Android mobile game titled World of Warships Blitz in 2018. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One console versions, titled World of Warships: Legends, followed in 2019 and were released on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in April 2021.

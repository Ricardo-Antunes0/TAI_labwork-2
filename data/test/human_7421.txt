James Arthur Mathieu (August 21, 1869 â€“ November 23, 1966) was known as "the last of the lumber kings," as well as "the Mighty Man of the Woods" and "the Lath King of America." Born in Alma, Wisconsin., he became an Ontario lumber merchant, philanthropist and political figure. He represented Rainy River in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario initially as a Liberal-Conservative in 1911, and then as a Conservative from 1914 to 1923 and 1926 to 1929. Biography Having worked in his youth as a log driver on the Mississippi River, Mathieu came to Rainy River from Minnesota around 1903 as a manager of the Rainy River Lumber Company's sawmill, later becoming manager and vice-president at the Shevlin-Clarke Company. He was later involved in controversy as part of what became known as the "Old Tory Timber Ring," when fellow Conservative Howard Ferguson, as Minister of Lands and Forests, arranged for the sale of three timber limits in the Quetico Forest Reserve to Shevlin-Clarke for less than half the price they would have normally fetched, and the company later paid a fine of $1.5 million for breaching the Crown Timber Act. The transactions were criticized in a subsequent inquiry.

Hurricane Pali was the earliest-forming Pacific hurricane on record, and the first Pacific hurricane to occur in January since Hurricane Ekeka in 1992. The first tropical cyclone of the 2016 Pacific hurricane season, Pali originated as an area of low pressure within a persistent trough, near the equator on January 6, 2016. Deep convection gradually built up around the center of the disturbance as the system curved northward, before it organized into a tropical depression on the next day, making the system the earliest recorded tropical cyclone in the Pacific hurricane basin. The system quickly reached tropical storm status and was named Pali. For the next couple of days, Pali slowly moved northward, while slowly curving towards the west, and the storm strengthened somewhat before weakening, due to the presence of wind shear. On January 10, Pali slowly turned eastward and proceeded to re-strengthen, as wind shear diminished. On January 12, Pali strengthened further into a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale (SSWHS), while curving towards the south. On January 13, Pali reached its peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane, with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 100mph (155km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg). Afterward, Pali quickly began to weaken, as the storm encountered stronger wind shear, with the storm falling to Category 1 intensity several hours later, before weakening into a tropical storm later that day. On January 14, Pali weakened into a tropical depression, before degenerating into a remnant low by January 15, as conditions became increasingly hostile. Later that day, Pali's remnants dissipated, near same the location where the storm had formed roughly a week ago. Pali formed and tracked near the equator, forming at a latitude of 3.3°N and tracking as low as 2.3°N as a tropical depression. This made Pali the second-lowest latitude tropical cyclone on record in the Western Hemisphere, which was extremely unusual, given the unfavorable conditions that are usually in place around the equator.

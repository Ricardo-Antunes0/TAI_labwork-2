Eagle Mountain, California, is a modern-day ghost town located in the Sierra Nevada foothills about east-southeast of Reno, Nevada. The town was founded in 1921 by a group of young mining engineers who discovered rich ore deposits on the mountain. The community thrived during the 1920s and 1930s, but by the end of World War II the mines had dried up and Eagle Mountain soon became a ghost town.   Today, Eagle Mountain is a popular tourist destination due to its panoramic views of Lake Tahoe and the surrounding mountains. The town is also home to the Eagle Mountain Casino and Resort, which features a golf course, spa, and restaurants.

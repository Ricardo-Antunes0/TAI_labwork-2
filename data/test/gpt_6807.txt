He served as Minister for Labour and National Service from 1932 to 1934, before becoming Minister for External Affairs in the Chifley government in 1938.  When World War II began, Fraser enlisted in the Australian Army again and was appointed Chief of General Staff in 1943. He became Prime Minister after the death of Ben Chifley in 1945, and led Australia during the final stages of World War II. After the war, Fraser continued to serve as Prime Minister until his retirement in 1949. He died two years later at the age of 81.

The Fairchild 45-80 Sekani (named for an aboriginal word meaning "thunderbird") was an American twin-engine general aviation aircraft built by Fairchild Aviation.  The Sekani was a high-wing, cantilever monoplane with a fixed tailwheel landing gear. It was powered by two Continental O-200 piston engines, each providing 260 horsepower (190 kW). The aircraft had a capacity for up to four passengers, and could reach a speed of 185 mph (298 km/h).  The Sekani was first flown in 1949. In 1953, it won the prestigious Harmon Trophy, awarded annually to the best American-built aircraft. The Sekani remained in production until 1957, when it was replaced by the Fairchild F-27 Marauder.

68 Publishers, also called Sixty-Eight Publishers, Sixtyeight Publishers, or even Nakladatelství 68 ('nakladatelství' is Czech for 'publishing house'), was a publishing house formed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1971 by Czech expatriate Josef Škvorecký and his wife Zdena Salivarová. The purpose of 68 Publishers was to publish books by Czech and Slovak writers whose works were banned in communist Czechoslovakia. The name '68 Publishers' is in commemoration of the Prague Spring of 1968. Škvorecký and Salivarová began by publishing both Czech originals, and English translations, of Škvorecký's books. The first book, Tankový prapor (The Republic of Whores) was published in 1971 and was followed by others such as Prima sezóna (The Swell Season), Zbabělci (The Cowards), Konec nylonového věku (End of the Nylon Age). These were followed by the books of Czech and Slovak authors that were banned in Czechoslovakia, and therefore accessible only to the Czech and Slovak community in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere outside the communist bloc. From here the books traveled secretly to the communist homeland.

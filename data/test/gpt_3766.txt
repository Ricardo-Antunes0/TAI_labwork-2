Ernest Graves Jr. (6 July 1924 â€“ 24 March 1998) was an American composer and musical arranger. He is perhaps best known for his work on the first two Batman films, for which he wrote the score and orchestrated the music. Graves also worked on the scores for The Towering Inferno, Superman, and The Godfather, among other films.  Born in New York City, Graves began his career as a jazz pianist before moving into orchestration. In the early 1960s, he began working on movies, scoring several low-budget horror and thriller films. His work on the first two Batman films brought him widespread recognition and led to more high-profile assignments. Graves died of a heart attack in 1998 at the age of 73.

The Nike Hercules, initially designated SAM-A-25 and code named Project Aries, was an American experimental jet aircraft. Developed in the early 1960s as part of the United States Air Force's secretive "advanced concepts" program, it was designed to be the first air-breathing jet aircraft capable of speeds in excess of Mach 2.  The Hercules was never flown operationally and is now only preserved in museums.

The "Dragons" armchair (French: "Fauteuil aux Dragons") is a furniture design by French designer Jean Prouvé.  The "Dragons" armchair was originally designed in 1953 for the Salle des Fêtes of the Chapelle du Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. It is made from wood and has a dragon's head at one end and wings at the other. It is currently on display at the Prouvé Museum in Paris.

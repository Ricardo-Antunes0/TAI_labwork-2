The County of Diepholz (West Low German: "Diepholz") was a county in the Holy Roman Empire. It lay on the right bank of the Rhine, opposite the County of Berg, and included the present-day Dutch municipalities of Diepholz, Enkhuizen, and Alphen aan den Rijn.  The Lordship of Diepholz was first mentioned in a deed from 882 AD. The county was originally ruled by a count palatine. In 1292 Count Otto II granted the Lordship to the House of Diepholz-Berg. The Diepholz counts became extinct in 1439 and it passed to the House of Habsburg. In 1648 it was conquered by the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands.

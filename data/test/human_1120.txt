Virbhadra Temple Myths and Legends Virabhadra is an avatar of Lord Shiva who was created by him in anger. The story in Hindu mythology describes that when Goddess Uma (Sati) felt insulted by her father Daksh Prajapati at Kankhal, Haridwar for not inviting her husband Lord Shiva for Yagya, she jumped into the Yagya Kund to immolate herself for her husband's dishonor. When Lord Shiva heard this news he became angry, pulled out his hair and thrashed on the ground. Consequently, Lord Virbhadra was born. The temple is located 2 km from Neelanth-Rishikesh Highway.

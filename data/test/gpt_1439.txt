Rudolf Hillebrecht (26 February 1910 - 6 December 1984) was a German mathematician.  Rudolf Hillebrecht was born in Herford, Germany in 1910. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Berlin in 1935 under the supervision of Heinrich Neumann. From 1936 to 1945, he was a professor at the University of Strasbourg, and from 1945 to 1966 he was a professor at the University of Frankfurt am Main.  Hillebrecht's work in mathematics focused on differential geometry and its applications to problems in physics and engineering. Some of his notable achievements include the development of the Hillebrecht–Weber metric and the Hillebrecht–Weber theorem, which are two important tools in geometry and physics. He also developed methods for solving problems in nonlinear functional analysis.  Hillebrecht died in Frankfurt am Main in 1984.

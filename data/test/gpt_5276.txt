Ahmed al-Jabari (; 1960; also known as Abu Musab al-Zarqawi; also spelled Jabarah, Jabareh, Jaberah, Jabarahi) was a Jordanian militant and terrorist who was affiliated with al-Qaeda.  Ahmed Jabari was born in 1960 in the Jordanian city of Zarqa to a Shia Muslim family. He had studied engineering at the University of Utah, but abandoned his studies to travel to Afghanistan in the early 1990s to join the jihad against the Soviet Union. Jabari became close to Osama bin Laden and other leaders of al-Qaeda, and began to preach radical Islamist ideology in Jordan. In 1998, he moved to Iraq to take part in the insurgency against Saddam Hussein's regime.  Jabari played an important role in al-Qaeda's efforts to foment sectarian violence in Iraq and recruit new members from among Sunni Muslim Iraqis. He also orchestrated several assassination attempts on Iraqi leaders. In November 2005, Jabari was killed by United States forces in Iraq during a raid on his stronghold, a building near Baghdad International Airport.

The Smoking Flowers are a rock duo from Nashville, Tennessee composed of husband and wife Scott and Kim Collins. Their style incorporates stylings from roots, alt-country, punk, and folk. The Repertoire  says "There are not enough words to describe the intrinsic chemistry Kim and Scott Collins possess. The duo, better known as The Smoking Flowers, have discovered what some duos spend their entire careers trying to find: a fascinating marriage between artistic talent and subtle sensuality that pierces the attention of anyone in the same room as them. The Collins' have devoted their entire lives to music, and the second their wild feet touch the stage they exude just how tenured they truly are." Kim and Scott are both vocalists and multi-instrumentalists. In any given show, vocalist Kim will play accordion, drums, mandolin, harmonica, tambourine and guitar, while Scott plays lead guitar, harmonica and sings.  Maverick Magazine calls them "a duo unafraid to take fascinating, artistic risks."   Their sound encompasses a wide range; they have been described as everywhere from "often beautifully ragged; sometimes beautifully haunting; many times beautifully goofy-grinned and/or playful, pleading, and pledging â€“ but always beautiful" to  "a punkish/alt-country/whatever-you-need-it-to-be masterpiece."

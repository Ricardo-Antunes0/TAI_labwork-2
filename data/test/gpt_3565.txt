The Norlina Subdivision is a railroad line owned and operated by the Union Pacific Railroad in the U.S. state of Nebraska. The line runs from Norlina, about east of Omaha, to Norwood, about west of Omaha.  The Norlina Subdivision was built in 1884 by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad as part of its extension of the Burlington Route from Omaha to Spearfish. The line was later acquired by the Union Pacific Railroad in 1892.

Pseudacraea clarkii, or Clark's false acraea, is a species of stony coral in the family Acraeidae. It is found in the Indo-Pacific region, from the Red Sea to East Africa.  This coral is easily identified by its narrow, elongated form and its delicate pink or white tubercles. It is usually solitary, but may form colonies of up to several hundred individuals. It feeds on algae and other microorganisms that grow on the coral's skeleton.  Clark's false acraea is threatened by over-fishing, coral disease, and sedimentation caused by coastal development.

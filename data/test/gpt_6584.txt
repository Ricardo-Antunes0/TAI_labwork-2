A non-aggression pact or neutrality pact is an agreement between states not to initiate or participate in armed conflict with one another.  Non-aggression pacts are controversial because they may allow for the peaceful coexistence of two states that are otherwise in conflict, but they may also give one state an unfair advantage.

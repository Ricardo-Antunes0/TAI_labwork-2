Rhagamys is an extinct genus of rodents from the early Eocene epoch of North America. The genus contains only one species, R. giganteus, the giant rhagamys. The giant rhagamys was the largest rodent ever to live on Earth, reaching a size of 2 meters in length and weighing up to 33 kilograms.  The giant rhagamys is known from a single specimen, which was discovered near White River in the U.S. state of Wyoming. This specimen is the most complete and advanced example of early Eocene rodent evolution currently known, and provides key insight into the evolution of large mammals in the Americas.  The giant rhagamys was a herbivore, which lived in a warm and wet environment on the edge of an ancient swampy forest. The species is believed to have died out around 50 million years ago, due to environmental changes that caused the swampy forest to disappear.

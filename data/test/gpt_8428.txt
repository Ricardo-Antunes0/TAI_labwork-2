Cort was born in 1861 in Boston, Massachusetts, to a prosperous family. After studying at Harvard College and working as a lawyer, he began his theatrical career as a stagehand. In 1892, he founded the John Cort Company, a production company that produced Broadway plays and musicals. He also became involved in the management of theaters, and in 1916 he founded the Cort Theatre Company, which was later renamed the Cort Theatre.  Cort's productions were known for their lavishness and innovation. He introduced new techniques such as sound effects and cinematography, and his productions became popular both on Broadway and in touring productions. He died in 1937 at the age of 83.

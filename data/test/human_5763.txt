The Blausteinsee Leisure and Recreation Area is an artificial lake north of the Eschweiler municipality in the Aachen district of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Its area is around 100 hectares and depth is 46m. It was created during the regeneration of the Zukunft opencast coal mine in the Rhineland coalfield, made by flooding the pit left by the mine with water. Today, the lake is a holiday area for the surrounding towns. The surface of the lake is 129 metres above sea level and its volume is around 25 million cubic metres. The filling of the lake began in 1994. The owner of the Blausteinsee is the Blausteinsee Leisure Centre GmbH, which was founded as a support organization in 1982 by the municipalities of Aldenhoven, Alsdorf, Eschweiler, Stolberg and WÃ¼rselen. The aim of this company is to create and maintain an attractive leisure and recreational area for the people of the Aachen region, along with coordination of activities on and around the lake.

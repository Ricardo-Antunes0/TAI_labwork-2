Catoryctis subnexella is a moth in the family Crambidae. It was described by George Hampson in 1912. It is found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Nigeria and Uganda.  The wingspan is about 15Â mm. The forewings are light brownish with a few scattered dark fuscous scales and a faint dark antemedian line. There is a long slender medial dark median fascia from before the middle of the costa to beyond the middle of the dorsum, as well as a short posterior fascia from beyond the costa to near the dorsum before the tornus. There is also a small dark spot on the costa at four-fifths, and another at one-fourth, these two together forming an indistinct fascia. The hindwings are brownish, lighter towards the apex.

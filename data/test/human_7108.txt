El Poblenou  is an extensive neighborhood of Barcelona (Sant Martí district) that borders the Mediterranean Sea to the south, Sant Adrià del Besòs to the east, Parc de la Ciutadella in  Ciutat Vella to the west, and Horta-Guinardó and Sant Andreu to the north. It is technically part of the Eixample, its layout having been drafted by Ildefons Cerdà, although the historic center of the neighborhood (which was once a town entirely separated from Barcelona) predates the grid. History During the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century, Poblenou was the epicenter of Catalan and Iberian industry, earning it its sobriquet of the Catalan Manchester. Surrounding the extensive cluster of factories stood mostly working class residential areas. When the industrial buzz passed, the neighborhood fell into a state of abandon and after a period of decay, the neighborhood underwent a dramatic transformation. The Olympic Games in 1992 were the main trigger for this massive transformation of El Poblenou. Many of the areas that have been developed — including the Vila Olímpica, the Diagonal Mar area, and the Fòrum area — arguably comprise their own neighborhoods. Completing its original, unfinished plan, The Avinguda Diagonal now stretches from Plaça de les Glòries to the sea. The massive 22@ plan sets to convert Poblenou into the city's technological and innovation district, as well as to increase leisure and residential spaces.

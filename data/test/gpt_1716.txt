The Battle of Bretoncelles was an event in the Hundred Years' War between the Kingdom of France and England, fought on 8 September 1346.  The French commander, John of Gaunt, sought to expand French territory in Brittany by capturing the English-held town of Bretoncelles. The English army commanded by Edward III was sent to stop him, but was defeated. This battle marked a turning point in the war; from then on, the English had to retreat from Brittany.

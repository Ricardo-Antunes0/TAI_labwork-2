"Hot Girls," also known as its alternate title "Nude Girls," is a documentary film by David O. Russell that explores the fashion industry and its relationship to sex and sexuality.  The film had its world premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival where it was awarded the Canada First Award for Best Canadian Feature Film. It also screened at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival, the 2015 Berlin Film Festival, and the 2015 Seattle International Film Festival. It was released in a limited release on October 20, 2015, by Roadside Attractions and obtained a wide release on December 4.  "Hot Girls" has received critical acclaim, with praise directed towards Russell's direction, the film's exploration of sexual politics and its depiction of models as people. It has also been noted for its unflinching look at fashion and its unflattering depictions of models, particularly those who are overweight or have body image issues.

Ali Shifau (born 19 May 1977) is a Maldivian film director, cinematographer and editor. One of the most successful filmmakers in Maldivian Cinema, Shifau is the recipient of a number of awards, including seven Gaumee Film Awards, and four Maldives Film Awards. In 2018, the Government of Maldives honoured him with the National Award of Recognition. Career Ali Shifau collaborated with Moomin Fuad to direct the critically appreciated crime film Heylaa (2006) featuring a cast of Ismail Rasheed, Ahmed Mauroof, Zeenath Abbas, Lufshan Shakeeb and Abdulla Muaz. The film narrates the story of a fourteen year old ambitious boy who finds himself unknowingly being involved in the smuggling of a revolver. Apart from directing the film, Shifau worked as the editor and cinematographer, marking it as the first Maldivian film to be shot in high-definition digital video. Though the film received positive reviews from critics, it was a commercial failure. Shifau opined that its commercial status was a result of casting "not very prominent" faces in the film and the "film-goers were not ready to accept the genre" at the time of its release. Ahmed Nadheem from Haveeru praised the narration and direction; "The film is embroiled in a realistic story which has sensible characters who are emotive under the helm of two great leaders serving as directors". At the 5th Gaumee Film Awards ceremony, Shifau won Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction award.

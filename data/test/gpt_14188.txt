Al-Qutailibiyah (, also spelled Kotailabiyah or Qutelbyeh) is a town in the Al-Qutailibiyah District of the Rif Dimashq Governorate, Syria. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), al-Qutailibiyah had a population of 8,452 in the 2004 census. It is situated on the Damascus-Homs highway, northeast of Damascus.  The first settlement at al-Qutailibiyah is thought to date back to the Pre-Islamic era. The town became an important center for trade and commerce in medieval times. In 1260, it was captured by the Mamluk sultan Baibars after a lengthy siege and subsequently became one of the main Mamluk settlements in Syria. Al-Qutailibiyah later passed into the hands of the Ottoman Empire and saw extensive development during Ottoman rule. The town's population grew rapidly as a result of this and by the end of Ottoman rule in 1918, it had a population of over 10,000. The town was liberated from French occupation in August 1920 and subsequently came under Syrian rule.   Al-Qutailibiyah has been heavily damaged by both Syrian and Israeli airstrikes during the Syrian Civil War. As a result, much of the town's historical architecture has been destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Despite this, al-Qutailibiyah remains an important commercial center and is home to several well known businesses.

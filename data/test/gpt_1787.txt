A single-domain antibody (sdAb), also known as a monoclonal antibody, is an antibody that is made only of one type of immunoglobulin molecule. A single-domain antibody typically has a single heavy and one light chain, although there are exceptions. The heavy chain is typically longer than the light chain, and the two chains are linked by a disulfide bridge.  Single-domain antibodies are unusual in that they are the only type of antibody found in nature. They are produced by some animals, including humans, B cells, and some plasma cells. They have been used to diagnose and treat diseases, including cancers.

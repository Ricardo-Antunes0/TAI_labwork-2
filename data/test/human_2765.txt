Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators is a 2019 book by the American journalist Ronan Farrow. He recounts the challenges he faced chasing the stories of Harvey Weinstein's decades of alleged rape, sexual assault, and sexual abuse of women and the case against him. Farrow argues that Weinstein was able to use Black Cube, a private Israeli intelligence service, to successfully pressure executives at NBC News to kill the story there, leading him to take it to The New Yorker, where it was published and helped spark the international #MeToo movement exposing sexual abuse, mostly of women, in many industries. The title refers to the practice of catch and kill, in which disreputable media companies purchase stories so that they can bury them. The book is published by Little, Brown and Company, and, according to Farrow, "was exhaustively vetted by Sean Lavery, a senior fact checker at The New Yorker".

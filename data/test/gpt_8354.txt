As in other Polynesian islands, Rapa Nui tattooing was used to distinguish important chiefs from their followers. The tattoos were also a form of body art, used to express the wearer's personality and to commemorate significant events in their life.  Rapa Nui tattooing is one of the Polynesian traditions that is still practiced today. The tattoos are usually tattoos on the back, but can also be found on other parts of the body. The tattoos are usually inked using natural pigments such as ochre and red earth, but have also been inked with synthetic dyes. Most Rapa Nui tattooing is done using traditional methods such as scratching with a shell or bone tool, but some tattoos are now done using needles.  The Rapa Nui people have a rich history and culture that is still being preserved today. The tattoos are one aspect of this culture that is being passed down from generation to generation.

Knowing Neurons is a neuroscience education website created by the Kavli Institute for Brain Science at UCSD. The site provides an overview of the anatomy and physiology of neurons, as well as information on their function in the brain. It also includes a wide range of resources, including videos, articles, and interactive tools.  Neurons are the cells of the brain responsible for controlling all our actions. They are composed of a long threadlike structure called a axon, which carries electrical signals to and from the cell body. Neurons can be distinguished by their shape and by the type of signaling they use. Some cells, such as those in the brain’s sensory organs, react to physical stimuli; others, such as neurons that control muscle movement, generate electrical signals.  The Kavli Institute for Brain Science at UCSD is committed to promoting an understanding of the brain and its functions through research and education. Knowing Neurons is one way we’re working to help people learn about neuroscience.

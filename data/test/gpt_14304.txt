The Ridgway family was one of the most prolific pottery families in the United States. Ridgway Pottery was founded in Ridgway, PA in 1868 by Abram and Laura Ridgway. The Ridgways produced an impressive array of utilitarian domestic wares as well as decorative objects for the home. The company prospered until the early 1930s, when the Great Depression caused a sharp decline in sales. The Ridgways were eventually forced to file for bankruptcy in 1935.   Today, Ridgway Potteries is remembered primarily for its distinctive painted dinnerware, which was popular in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Many collectors prize Ridgway pieces for their vibrant color and delicate brushwork.

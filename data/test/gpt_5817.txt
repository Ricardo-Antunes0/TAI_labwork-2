Jacobus Verkade (29 March 1906, Zaandam â€“ 7 August 1967, Amsterdam) was a Dutch composer and pianist.  Verkade studied music theory and piano at the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in Amsterdam with S.J. van Beethoven and Arnold Schoenberg. He became interested in the music of Igor Stravinsky, but also developed his own original style. In the 1940s, he was one of the leading composers of Dutch popular music. After the war, Verkade composed mainly for chamber ensembles, but he continued to write occasional pieces for orchestra. In 1963 he was awarded the prestigious Johan Wagenaar Prize.

The Brookhaven Rail Terminal (BRT) is a truck-train trans-load facility in Yaphank, New York on Long Island. The 28-acre initial site was built with $40 million in private funds and opened on September 27, 2011. It is projected to take 40,000 long haul trucks off Long Island roads and handle 1 million tons of freight a year by 2016. It includes 13,000 feet of new track, with three tracks for construction material, such as asphalt and concrete, and six tracks for merchandise, such as flour and biodiesel. Operations Train operations on the site are handled by U.S. Rail of New York, LLC (reporting mark USNY),  a Class III shortline railroad formed to operate the facility.  Two EMD GP38 locomotives are used for on-site switching, while rail cars are delivered and picked up by the New York and Atlantic Railway which operates over the Long Island Rail Road Main Line. The site was chosen to minimize residential and traffic impacts: it is close to exit 66 on the Long Island Expressway and 1/4 mile from the nearest home. (A proposal for a similar facility at the former Pilgrim State Hospital, 18 miles to the west, was stymied by local opposition.) Adjacent tracts totaling an additional 93 acres are available for further expansion, including possible facilities for intermodal containers and refrigerated storage.  The facility expected to handle over 10,000 railcars in its first full operating year.

Gnaeus Gellius ( half of 2nd centuryBC) was a Roman historian. Very little is known about his life and work, which has only survived in scattered fragments. He continued the historical tradition set by Fabius Pictor of writing a year-by-year history of Rome from mythological times to his day. However, with about a hundred books, Gellius' Annales were massively more developed than the other Roman annalists, and was only surpassed by Livy's gigantic History of Rome. Life Gnaeus Gellius belonged to the plebeian gens Gellia. The gens was probably of Samnite origin as two generals of the Second and Third Samnite wars bore this name (Statius Gellius and Gellius Egnatius). Some of its members later moved to Rome, perhaps not long before the historian was born, since only one Roman named Gellius is known before himâ€”likely his father, likewise with the name Gnaeus.  The historian's father was opposed in court to a man named Lucius Turius, who was defended by Cato the Censor.  Several scholars have however considered that the historian was the same as Cato's opponent, but this view seems now abandoned.

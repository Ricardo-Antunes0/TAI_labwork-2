Sergei Pavlovich Medvedev (15 March 1885 â€“ 26 December 1936) was a Russian revolutionary and one of the main organisers of the October Revolution. He served as the first General Secretary of the Soviet Union from 1991 to 1991.  Born in Nizhny Novgorod, Medvedev joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1904. He was arrested in 1906 for belonging to a secret organisation and spent four years in exile in Siberia. After returning to Russia in 1911, he became an active organiser within the party and was elected to the Central Committee in 1917. Medvedev played a leading role in the October Revolution of 1917, serving as deputy head of the Soviet government and chairing the Revolutionary Military Council. After Lenin's death in 1924, he succeeded him as First Secretary of the Soviet Union and remained in this position until his death in 1936.  During his time as First Secretary, Medvedev intensified collectivisation and industrialisation policies, leading to rapid economic growth. He also undertook extensive domestic reform, including the creation of social welfare programmes and new educational institutions. However, his efforts to secure Moscow's authority over other regions led to increased tensions within the Soviet Union and extensive controversy over his rule. Medvedev is regarded as one of the most significant figures in 20th-century Russian history and was selected by Russia as one of its 25 national heroes in 2003.

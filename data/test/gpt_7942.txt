The Miraflores Altarpiece (or Triptych of the Resurrection) is a religious artwork by Diego Vel√°zquez, painted in 1656. It is now in the Royal Collection in London.  The painting is made up of three panels, each measuring 183 cm by 198 cm. The central panel shows the Virgin Mary and Christ enthroned, with angels and saints surrounding them. The two outer panels display different scenes from the life of Jesus. The left-hand panel shows the meeting of Christ and Nicodemus, while the right-hand panel portrays his crucifixion and resurrection.

The Irish Citizen Army , or ICA, was a volunteer paramilitary organisation in Ireland during the Anglo-Irish War of 1919-1921. The ICA was formed in April 1919, as a response to the Irish Government's refusal to recognise the independence of the Irish Republic, which had been proclaimed in Dublin on Easter Monday 1918. The ICA was largely volunteer-based, with an estimated 10,000 members by 1921. However, the ICA was also supported by a number of pro-Treaty forces, and its activities were sometimes covertly assisted by the British military.  The ICA played a limited role in the war, although they engaged in skirmishes with the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and British Army. The ICA was effectively suppressed by 1921, when the Treaty of Anglo-Irish Agreement ended the war. However, the organisation remains significant for its role in early Irish republicanism and for its legacy in later Irish nationalist movements.

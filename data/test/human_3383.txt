Guzman qualified as a lone wrestler for the Peruvian squad in the men's 60 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Earlier in the process, he placed second at the Pan American Championships in Guatemala City, Guatemala, but managed to fill up an entry by the International Federation of Association Wrestling through a tripartite invitation. He lost his opening match to Japan's Makoto Sasamoto on technical superiority, but bounced back to eclipse Serbia and Montenegro's Davor Štefanek in overtime with a 3–1 decision during the prelim pool round. Placing second in the pool and fifteenth in the final standings, Guzman failed to advance to the quarterfinals.

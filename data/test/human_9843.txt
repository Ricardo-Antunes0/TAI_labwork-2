Lately entered the hip hop scene in 2009 with his debut mixtape, Straight Outta Somewhere, presented by 2Dopeboyz.com. J.Lately’s name comes from the idea that one should continually seek change through growth and progression versus the thought that change is bad and one shouldn’t be different than they used to be, so this is him, "Lately." Career  J.Lately started rapping casually during the middle of his school years at Analy High School where cadence and flow came naturally to him. It wasn’t until he went to college where he got deep into hip hop as an artist and began performing shows. Since 2009, he has released mixtapes, solo albums, collaborative works with various West Coast hip hop artists, and singles. Lately’s music has been described as a “soulful style and laid back flow” on boom bap beats with a “rare ability to make you contemplate and vibe out simultaneously.”

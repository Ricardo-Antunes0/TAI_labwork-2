Maharao Shardul Singh ji Shekhawat was born in 1681 and was the ruler of Jhunjhunu (in present-day Rajasthan, India). After his death the estate was divided equally among his five sons, whose descendants continued to rule over it until India achieved independence. To commemorate the memory of their father, his sons made a monumental dome with a fresco at Parasrampura. All five sons were very brave, capable, and efficient rulers. They raised many new villages, towns, forts and palaces, encouraged the Seths (merchants) for trade. As a result they grew rich and made many havelies. The fresco-paintings of these havelies speak about that period and prosperity. Moreover the rich merchants made the wells ponds, bawaries, temples and inns at various places. They are the examples of industrial architectural excellence. The fresco-painting probably came into existence in the 18th century. It was during the period of Shardual Singh ji that fresco painting was in much vogue.

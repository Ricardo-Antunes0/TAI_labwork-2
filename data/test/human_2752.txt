Nantwich railway station serves the town of Nantwich, Cheshire, England. It is on the Crewe to Shrewsbury line  south west of Crewe. Opened in 1858, it was the junction for the Great Western Railway route to Wellington via Market Drayton until 1963. History The town was initially considered as potential calling point for the Grand Junction Railway route between London, Birmingham and Manchester/Liverpool, but opposition from coaching and canal interests therein led to the Grand Junction being routed through  instead.  The Crewe and Shrewsbury Railway would end up being the first route into the town - authorised by parliament in 1852, it was eventually opened in September 1858 and was operated by the London and North Western Railway.  This subsequently became part of a busy through route between the north west of England and South Wales (the modern day Welsh Marches Line).  The Nantwich and Market Drayton Railway linking the titular towns opened five years later, making the station a junction in the process - known locally as the "Gingerbread Line" (Market Drayton being renown for the production of said confectionery), it was later extended to Wellington and officially became part of the Great Western Railway system in 1897.  This line was a busy freight artery but in pre-grouping days was also used by the GWR to run expresses all the way to Manchester London Road (albeit using running rights over the LNWR north of Nantwich).

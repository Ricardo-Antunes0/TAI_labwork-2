Relativistic programming (RP) is a style of computer programming that uses relativistic methods to achieve high performance. RP is a general-purpose programming paradigm that can be used for a wide range of applications, including scientific computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and financial engineering.  RP was first proposed in 1987 by John McCarthy and Peter Norvig, and has since been used in a variety of applications, including control systems, distributed computing, natural language processing, and bioinformatics. RP is also known for its high performance, due in part to its use of relativistic methods such as vectorized operations and multithreading.

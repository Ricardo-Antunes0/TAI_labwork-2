Northrepps is a village and a civil parish in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is situated about south of the town of Filey and about west of the A1 road. The population of Northrepps, including the civil parish of Northrepps and the village of Byron, was estimated at around 1,500 in 2001.  The name Northrepps is Anglo Saxon in origin and means "Northern Farm". The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as "Nordrephes" and was part of the lands held by Robert de Ferrers. By the early 13th century, there were two manors - Northrepps and Byron - within the parish. In 1881, a railway station was opened on the Huddersfield Line which served the village until its closure in 1969. The station was later reopened as a heritage centre.  Northrepps is located on the edge of a valley which runs north-south through the parish. To the east, the valley opens out onto marshland which extends towards Filey Bay. To the west, the valley narrows and becomes part of a larger valley which forms part of the River Ullswater. The main settlement in Northrepps is located on top of a small hill which overlooks both valleys. The other settlements in Northrepps are located around the edges of the valley.   The main economic activity in Northrepps is agriculture. There are two farms in the parish - East Park Farm and West Park

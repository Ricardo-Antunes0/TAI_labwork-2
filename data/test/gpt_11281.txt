Azadveh-i Banegan Mahan-i Mihr-Bondad, known in Arabic as Azadbeh (آزاده), is a ruined city in northern Iraq, which served as the capital of the Akkadian Empire during the 3rd millennium BC.  Azadbeh was one of the most important cities of the Akkadian Empire, and was located on a major trade route between Mesopotamia and Anatolia. The city was destroyed by fire in the late 2nd millennium BC, probably during a period of political instability. The site has not been excavated extensively, but is thought to have been extensively damaged by looting in antiquity.  Some of the most notable archaeological finds from Azadbeh include an astronomical observatory and a statue of an eagle-headed god. The ruins are currently managed by the Iraqi Directorate General for Antiquities and Museums.

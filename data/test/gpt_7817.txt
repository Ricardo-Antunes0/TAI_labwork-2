Sinatruces (also spelled Sinatrukes or Sanatruces) was an ancient Iranian dynasty which ruled parts of Parthia, mostly in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC.  The dynasty was founded by Arsaces I, who had overthrown the Seleucid Empire. Sinatruces initially claimed to be heirs of the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia, but they were eventually recognized as a separate dynasty by the Greeks. Sinatruces reached their apogee under Arsaces II, who was the last great king of the dynasty. The kingdom was dissolved by the Roman Republic in AD 62.  The dynasty is known primarily from numismatic evidence, especially coins and medallic evidence. The royal court of the dynasty is also well attested through archaeological investigations.

The project has been in the planning stages for many years, but has recently gained popularity due to increased gas prices and the need for more sustainable transportation options.  The Uinta Basin Rail project would provide a much-needed boost to the economy of both Utah counties and the state as a whole. It would create jobs in construction and manufacturing, as well as provide an alternate route for goods traveling between the two states. Additionally, the line would help reduce pollution in the area by transporting goods using less fuel.

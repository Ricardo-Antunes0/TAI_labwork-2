After successive stints with the Memphis Grizzlies and Indiana Pacers, Evans, who would have become a free agent at the end of the 2019 season, was dismissed and disqualified from the NBA in May for violating the terms of the league's anti-drug program, but was reinstated in February 2022. High school career Tyreke Evans was born in Chester, Pennsylvania, where he was chiefly raised by his three older brothers. For high school, Evans attended American Christian Academy in Aston, Pennsylvania.

In his senior campaign, he put up averages of 32.1 points, 8.8 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 4.3 steals per game. He was selected as the MVP of the McDonald's High School All-American Game and, together with Brandon Jennings, was named co-MVP of the Jordan Brand Classic.

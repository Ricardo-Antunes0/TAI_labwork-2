Wynyard Cricket Club (WCC) is a cricket team which represents the town of Wynyard in the North West Tasmanian Cricket Association (now Cricket North West) grade cricket competition. The side was admitted to the NWTCA competition for the 1952/53 season and originally played on a concrete wicket. By 1954 they had laid a turf pitch, and in the 1957/58 season they narrowly missed out on their first title by losing to Sheffield in the Grand Final by 29 runs on first innings, and running out of time in run chase for outright victory. The club remained competitive for the next decade, and played a remarkable grand final tie led by captain John Coughlan against Burnie/Yeoman Cricket Club in the 1965/66 season, both sides being all out for 122. However Wynyard were awarded the title on the basis of having finished higher in the league, and so won their first NWTCA premiership.

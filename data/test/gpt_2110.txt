The cotton competitiveness provisions are provisions added to the Agricultural Trade Act of 2002 (part of the US Farm Bill) that were designed to help US cotton producers compete with cotton imports.  The provisions were designed to help cotton producers by reducing the cost of inputs, such as pesticides and fertilizer, and by increasing the availability of credit. The provisions also allowed for the importation of cotton from countries with lower production costs.  The Cotton Competitiveness Provisions were repealed in 2017 as part of the Farm Bill re-authorization.

Greenbelt is a shopping mall located at Ayala Center, Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines, near Glorietta and SM Makati. It is owned by Ayala Malls, a real-estate subsidiary of Ayala Land, which is an affiliate of Ayala Corporation. It opened in 1988 and is one of Ayala Corporation's flagship projects. The mall offers a mix of high-end retail shops, restaurants, amenities, leisure, and entertainment. Currently, the mall has five sections: two enclosed areas, two buildings with open-air shopping areas, and Greenbelt 5, which opened in 2007. History Built around a  retail complex, the mall merged the previous small arcades and shops, and first opened to the public in 1988. Ayala Land conceptualized Greenbelt as the Philippines's first lifestyle center with bars, posh boutiques, lush tropical greenery, a world-class museum and an elegant chapel. It was renovated in 2001, and as the complex grew, Greenbelt 2 and 3 were opened in 2002, with Greenbelt 4 and 5 opening in 2004 and 2007, respectively, based on other pioneer shops in the area.

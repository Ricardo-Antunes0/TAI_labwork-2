The Parisian Sphinx is an oil on canvas painting by Belgian painter Alfred Stevens. Painted between 1875 and 1877, it depicts a dreamy young woman (or aristocratic demi-monde) gently supporting her head with her hand. The painting is part of the permanent collection of the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp. The Parisian Sphinx shows the influence of Vermeer and the other Netherlandish old masters on Stevens, and testifies to the Symbolist influence in the latter's day. It incorporates a harmonious juxtaposition of superficial Dutch realism with the spreading Symbolist manner, as opposed to the bottom-up, pluralistic symbolism of the declining Romanticism. While well executed and apparently quite realistic, the painting has also a non-plain meaning.  Beside being renowned for its realism and luminism, The Parisian Sphinx has been described as enigmatic, just as its title. Critics agree in that the apparently realistic painting conceals a hidden meaning. Many point to the "hidden dangers behind feminine tenderness", and to the figure of the femme fatale.

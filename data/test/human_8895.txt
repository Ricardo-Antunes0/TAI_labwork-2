Aslaug Haviland (January 19, 1913 â€“ January 6, 2003), known as "Utah's Helen Keller" was a deaf and blind Norwegian woman who came to the United States at the age of 16 to attend the Perkins Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. She became a nationally renowned motivational speaker. Biography Aslaug Haviland was born in Bergen, Norway, January 19, 1913. At age 12 she contracted scarlet fever, and as a result lost both her hearing and vision. Little is known about her early life except that after the loss of her hearing she first attended Norway's school for the deaf, where she learned sign language, and later went on to attend the Royal School for the Blind. At the age of 16, Haviland's family was able to save up enough money to send her to the Perkins School for the Blind. There was not, however, enough money for anyone to travel with her, so Haviland traveled alone by boat to Boston. She recorded that all of the individuals on the boat, including the captain, looked after her. Even though she was ill for both the journey and most of her time in Boston, Haviland had a great desire to learn English. Though Haviland returned to Norway after her studies at the Perkins School for the Blind had finished, she eventually was able to teach herself English.

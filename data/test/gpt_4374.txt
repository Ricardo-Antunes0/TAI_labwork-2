Brill Palace was a medieval English royal palace.  The palace was located in the town of Brill, Buckinghamshire, about northeast of London.  Brill Palace was first built by William the Conqueror in 1066 as a hunting lodge. It became the formal residence of the Kings and Queens of England after the Norman Conquest. The palace was destroyed by fire in 1248, but was rebuilt by King Henry III. It was abandoned in 1327 and demolished in 1420.

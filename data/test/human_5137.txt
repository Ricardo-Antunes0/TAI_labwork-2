Chloropyron is a genus of plants in the botanical family Orobanchaceae. The plants of this group were formerly classified in the subgenus Hemistegia of the genus Cordylanthus, but were elevated to genus level by David C. Tank, John Mark Egger and Richard G. Olmstead in 2009 after molecular phylogenetic work. Taxonomy The genus Chloropyron was first described by the German-American polymath Hans Hermann Behr, an immigrant to San Francisco, in 1855. Behr was largely ignored, and the known species were classified in the genus Cordylanthus, but the species now placed in the modern genus Chloropyron were classified in an unranked infrageneric group by Asa Gray in 1867, which he called Hemistegia.   The first species to be described was Chloropyron maritimum. Thomas Nuttall first described it in the genus Cordylanthus, but this was only in an unpublished manuscript, and was thus not a valid taxonomic name. George Bentham, however, revived the name in his 1846 entry on these plants in Augustin Pyramus de Candolle's Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis.

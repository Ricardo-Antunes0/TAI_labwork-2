Puabi (Akkadian: ð’…¤ð’€€ð’‰¿ Pu-A-Bi "Word of my mouth") is an early Mesopotamian goddess whose cult may have been centred at Ur. She was the consort of Ningirsu, the god of war, and mother of Ninurta, the god of agriculture.  Puabi was originally a minor goddess associated with the city of Ur in southern Mesopotamia. She later attained greater prominence, becoming the patron goddess of the city and its people. Her worship may have involved ritual prostitution.  Puabi was also known as "Queen of Heaven" and "Lady of Justice". She was depicted as a woman with a lion's head or as a woman with wings.

The President Show is an American comedy television series that premiered on April 27, 2017, on Comedy Central. The show was created by Anthony Atamanuik who also stars as Donald Trump, the former President of the United States, alongside Peter Grosz as Mike Pence, the Vice President. Format Introduced as "the forty-fifth and final President of the United States", Atamanuik as Trump begins each episode at a "press-conference" set, during which he announces tonight's theme and a variation of his catchphrase, "I'm the president. Can you believe it? Let's roll!", which signals a transition to the title sequence. After the opening, Trump is shown in the Oval Office set, accompanied by Peter Grosz as Mike Pence, and the two perform a segment pertaining to the recent week's news. Next, a pre-taped segment is shown with either Trump, Pence, or both on-location interacting with various groups of people in-character. After that, Trump interviews a guest at a Mar-a-Lago set. Finally, back in the Oval Office, Trump and Pence deliver a farewell address, often taking form of a sketch, which transitions into the closing credits.

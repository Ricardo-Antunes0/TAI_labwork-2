John Harold Glen (31 December 1941 â€“ 23 December 1998), better known by his stage name Johnny Leeze, was an American blues and soul singer and songwriter.  Born in the segregated city of Memphis, Tennessee, Glen began his music career in the early 1960s as a backing vocalist for various local acts. In 1966, he recorded his first solo album, entitled "Johnny Leeze". The following year, he found success with the single "I Can't Quit You Baby" (which reached number six on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart), which was followed by a successful tour. Glen's subsequent albums received critical acclaim, and he was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1995. He died from cancer in 1998 at the age of 53.

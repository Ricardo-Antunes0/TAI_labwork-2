Ken Popert has been involved with Pink Floyd since the band's earliest days. He was initially a roadie and then a sound engineer for the group, working on their first two albums, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and A Saucerful of Secrets. He also engineered the group's fourth album, The Dark Side of the Moon.   After Dark Side of the Moon, Popert left Pink Floyd to work with other bands, but he rejoined them in 1987 for their tour celebrating the 25th anniversary of The Dark Side of the Moon. He has remained with them ever since, serving as both a sound engineer and producer. He has been responsible for many of the band's most iconic recordings, including 1994's The Division Bell and 2005's The Endless River.   In recent years, Popert has focused on his own music. He released his debut album, entitled The End of the Beginning, in 2009.

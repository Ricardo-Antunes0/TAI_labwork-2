John Henry Hallows (16 February 1907 â€“ 7 November 1983) was an English experimental physicist, who made important contributions to the development of quantum mechanics and to the understanding of the behavior of subatomic particles.  Born in 1907 in Nottingham, Hallows began his academic career at the University of Nottingham in 1928 as a research assistant in the department of physics under the supervision of Ernest Rutherford. In 1933 he moved to the University of Cambridge, where he became a research fellow in quantum mechanics.  Hallows' work on quantum mechanics led him to develop new theories on the behavior of subatomic particles, culminating in his book The Structure and Behavior of Quarks (1956). His work also helped to clarify the relationship between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics. Hallows was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1956. He retired from his academic career in 1967, but continued to work on scientific projects until his death in 1983.

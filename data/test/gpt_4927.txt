Taylor's salamander, Ambystoma taylori, is a species of salamander in the family Plethodontidae. It is endemic to the United States, where it is found only in the Appalachian Mountains.  Taylor's salamander is a small, slender salamander with a long tail. It is generally drab, with a light green or olive dorsum, and a dark green or black ventral surface. The head is green with black markings, and the eyes are yellow. The salamander has two dorsal glands, which it uses to release a foul-smelling fluid to deter predators.  Taylor's salamander lives in cool, deep streams and rivers in the Appalachian Mountains. It feeds on small invertebrates such as insects and spiders. It breeds in late summer and fall, laying eggs in underground chambers. The eggs hatch in about six weeks, and the larvae develop into adults over the winter.

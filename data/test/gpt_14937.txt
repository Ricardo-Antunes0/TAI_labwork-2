Six ships of the Royal Navy have been named Nassau, after the Dutch city of The Hague.   Nassau was the capital city of the Dutch Republic and later the Dutch Empire, and played an important role in European history.

In 1702 she captured a Spanish treasure fleet of 23 ships carrying a total of £1 million worth of gold and silver. After Rooke's death in 1705 she was sold to the Royal Navy for £12,000.

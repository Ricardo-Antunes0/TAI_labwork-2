In Cantonese phonology, a close relationship exists between nasal-stop alternation and vowel harmony. Both phenomena are motivated by the principle of Economy of Phonology, which states that a language should avoid making unnecessary distinctions in its articulatory phonology.  Cantonese nasal-stop alternation involves the alternation of nasals with stop consonants in certain positions within syllables. In particular, nasals always occur before stops in the middle of a word, but never at the end of a word. This restriction is known as the Cantonese Rule.   The Cantonese Rule is motivated by two factors: (1) The syllable structure of Cantonese words is relatively rigid, with few exceptions; and (2) Nasal obstruents are difficult to produce in isolation, due to their close proximity to other vowels. As a result, it is often more economical for Cantonese speakers to simply pronounce stop consonants before nasals rather than attempt to produce both sounds simultaneously.  Although the Cantonese Rule has been observed throughout the history of the language, it has undergone significant change over time. Currently, there is a trend towards less reliance on the Cantonese Rule, with some speakers instead pronouncing stop consonants before nasals whenever they occur in any position within a syllable.

Where metaphysics tries to explain what is beyond the physical world, feminist metaphysics looks at the physical world from a feminist perspective.   Feminist metaphysics is a subfield of metaphysics that tries to explore the nature of reality from a feminist perspective. Feminist metaphysics is concerned with understanding the ways in which different forms of gender oppression impact both ontology and epistemology. Feminist metaphysics also seeks to explore how feminist theories can be used to explain physical phenomena.  One of the key goals of feminist metaphysics is to help feminists understand their own experience and perspectives. Feminist metaphysics also aims to provide a more holistic view of reality, by incorporating feminist theories into other branches of philosophy such as ontology and epistemology.  There is currently no single definition of feminist metaphysics, as the field is still in its early stages of development. However, some key features that are typically considered to be characteristic of feminist metaphysics include an analysis of gender dynamics and oppression, an emphasis on womenâ€™s experiences, and an integration of feminist theory into other branches of philosophy.

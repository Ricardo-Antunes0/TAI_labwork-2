The Enterprise Act 2002 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that regulates the use of electronic communications in the public sector. The Act covers a wide range of topics, including the use of electronic communications for the purposes of public procurement, staff communication, and information sharing.  The Enterprise Act 2002 was introduced as a private member's bill by Conservative MP John Hayes, and received its royal assent on 8 July 2002. The Act replaced the Public Sector Communications Code 2002, which had been introduced in 2001. The main purposes of the Enterprise Act 2002 were to modernize and improve the regulation of public sector electronic communications, and to give government agencies more flexibility in using electronic technologies.  The Enterprise Act 2002 has been widely praised for its efforts to improve public sector communications, and has been cited as a model for other countries wishing to introduce similar reforms. In 2007, the Act was amended to include provisions relating to the use of social media in the public sector.

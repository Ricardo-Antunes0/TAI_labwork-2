Frederick, Michigan, also known as Casino, was founded in 1837 on the Grand River. The city prospered as a center of lumber and agriculture, but its growth was stunted by the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. In the late 19th century, Frederick became a center of automotive production with the establishment of Henry Ford's factory. The city's fortunes declined in the early 20th century as the automotive industry moved to more industrialized locations. However, Frederick has experienced a revival in recent years with a burgeoning downtown area and burgeoning cultural scene.  Frederick, Michigan was founded on the Grand River in 1837.

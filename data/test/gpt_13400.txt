The Hydrus (also known as Enhydros, Enidros, or Echidna) is a legendary creature said to inhabit lakes and rivers. It is a serpent or snake with a human head and torso, but the rest of its body is that of a fish. Some say that the Hydrus has two heads, one of which stares in opposite directions.  The Hydrus is said to be able to breathe air and water, and to have the power to turn people into fish if they are bitten. Some say that it can also breathe fire. It is said that the Hydrus can live for hundreds of years, and that it has the power to heal wounds.

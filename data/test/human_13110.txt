The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) is an international consortium of scientists dedicated to conducting meta- and mega-analyses of genomic-wide genetic data, with a focus on psychiatric disorders. It is the largest psychiatric consortium ever created, including over 800 researchers from 38 countries as of 2019. Its goal is to generate information about the genetics of psychiatric conditions that will be "actionable", that is, "genetic findings whose biological implications can be used to improve diagnosis, develop rational therapeutics, and craft mechanistic approaches to primary prevention". The consortium makes the main findings from its research freely available for use by other researchers. History The PGC was founded in early 2007, originally as the Psychiatric Genome Wide Association Consortium. One of its founders was Patrick F. Sullivan (UNC School of Medicine), who now serves as its lead principal investigator. It was initially a branch of the Genetic Association Information Network, a public-private partnership aimed at researching the genetics of human disorders in general.

Gubash of Gukhoy (Chechen: КIужалан Губаш, Russian: Губаш Гухоевский) was a Chechen elder of the Gukhoy teip. He was notorious for being anti-Imamate and fighting Imam Shamil while being blind. Most of the information about Gubash is from the two scribes of Imam Shamil named Imanmuhammad Gigatlinsky and Al-Karakhi. However Dalkhan Khozhaev's book "Чеченцы в Русско-Кавказской войне" from 1998 tells several folk tales about the personality of Gubash and the incident in Guta. Early life  Gubash was born in the Chechen highland village of Guta which belonged to the Gukhoy teip. He was a famous warrior and leader of the Gukhoy clansmen that respected him. Gubash and his brother Gela were descendants of a man called "Sharak" that allegedly came from the Malkhi teip that is located in the southern Chechnya region. Even though Gubash is described as being against the "Sharia" in contemporary sources by the scribes of Imam Shamil he was still a Muslim as Islam had already spread to all parts of Chechnya during this time.

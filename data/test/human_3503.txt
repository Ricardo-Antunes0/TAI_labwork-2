Jacqueline Picasso or Jacqueline Roque (24 February 1927 – 15 October 1986) was best known as the muse and second wife of Pablo Picasso. Their marriage lasted 11 years until his death, during which time he created over 400 portraits of her, more than any of Picasso's other loves. Early life Born in 1927 in Paris, France, she was only two when her father abandoned her mother and her five -year-old brother. Jacqueline never forgave him. Her mother raised her in cramped concierge's quarters near the Champs Elysées, while also working long hours as a seamstress. Jacqueline was 18 when her mother died of a stroke. In 1946, Jacqueline married André Hutin, an engineer, with whom she had a daughter, Catherine Hutin-Blay. The young family moved to Africa, where Hutin worked, but four years later Jacqueline returned to France and divorced Hutin. She settled down on the French Riviera and took a job at her cousin's shop, the Madoura Pottery in Vallauris.

Hairwork, or jewelry made of human hair, is a centuries-old tradition. From hair fans to hair necklaces, hair ornaments are popular among women of all ages.  Hairwork is made from a variety of materials, including metal, wood, plastic, glass, and beads. The most popular type of hairwork is jewelry, which can be made into necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and other pieces. Hairwork can also be used as an art form, and many talented hairweavers create beautiful pieces that are unique and one-of-a-kind.

Erwin Nathaniel Griswold (; July 14, 1904 â€“ November 15, 1984) was an American artist who was associated with the Abstract Expressionism movement. He was born in New York City to a Jewish family.  Griswold studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (B.F.A., 1925) and the School of Paris (M.A., 1927). He then taught at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 1928 to 1944 and at Yale University from 1945 to 1965. In 1965 he became a professor at Columbia University. Griswold was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1948 and a National Medal of Arts in 1982.  Griswold's best-known paintings are depictions of nature, often with strong emotional overtones, and often made using large, gestural brushstrokes. His work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and many other museums.

Ford Motor Company's restructuring plan, made public in 2006, was known as The Way Forward. Ford was attempting to reduce fixed capital costs while maintaining a special focus on cars and car-based crossover vehicles. Over time, it hoped to make more of its product line profitable instead of relying on a limited portion of the products for profit. Making good profits across the product line required that the company reduce the costs of development and production, while introducing new products that connect with consumers. In the latter half of 2005, Chairman Bill Ford asked newly appointed Ford Americas Division President Mark Fields to develop a plan to return the company to profitability. Fields previewed the Plan, dubbed "The Way Forward", at the December 7, 2005 board meeting of the company; and it was unveiled to the public on January 23, 2006.  The plan was revised on September 15, 2006 to accelerate plant closings.

The Columbia Unbecoming controversy was a controversy that emerged in the United States in the late 1990s and early 2000s over whether the University of Columbia had become too politically correct.  The controversy began with a series of articles in the "Columbia Spectator" newspaper, which argued that the university had become excessively PC, and that its policies were stifling free speech. The articles sparked a backlash from students and faculty, who accused the newspaper of racism and sexism. The controversy reached a peak in 2000, when a student protest against the campus's policies turned violent.  Ultimately, the controversy did not have a significant impact on University of Columbia's operations. However, it has been cited as an example of how politically correct attitudes can lead to censorship and political correctness gone too far.

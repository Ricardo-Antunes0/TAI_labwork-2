Pythagoras of Samos (, or simply ; c. 570 BC â€“ c. 454 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher, mathematician, and scientist. He is revered as a founder of the Pythagorean school of philosophy and mathematics, and is best known for his theorem that bears his name.  Pythagoras is also credited with developing the theory of musical intervals, and is said to be the first to describe the harmonic intervals between notes in terms of their frequencies. He was also the first to calculate the length of a hypotenuse using Pythagorean theorem.  Although little is known about his personal life, Pythagoras is recognized as one of the most influential thinkers in ancient Greece. He was a central figure in the development of mathematics, and his work in geometry and music theory has had a lasting impact on both these disciplines.

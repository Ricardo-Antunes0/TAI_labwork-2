On July 28, 2014, it was officially released by her record label and later included on her debut extended play, Room 93 on October 27, 2014. It was re-released as a single from her debut studio album, Badlands, along the re-release of the EP on March 9, 2015, through Astralwerks. Critical reception for the song was generally positive. The accompanying music video has received over 60 million views on video-sharing website YouTube. Background "Ghost" was posted on Halsey's SoundCloud page for streaming on February 3, 2014. The song garnered online buzz which was an opening opportunity for Halsey to sign a record deal with Astralwerks, leading to the eventual publication of the Room 93 EP and additional videos for "Hurricane" and "Ghost". Halsey expressed about the song, "The concept of the song itself is about being in a relationship with someone who isn’t emotionally available: you feel their physical presence but the emotional one isn’t there."

 Year 239 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Cornelius and Gaius (or, less frequently, year 539 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination 239 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.  239 BC was a significant year in Roman history. The consuls Cornelius and Gaius, who had held office only a few months before, were able to conclude a treaty with the Teutonic tribes that effectively ended their military campaigns in northern Italy. As a result of this treaty, Rome was able to devote more resources to her struggle against Carthage. The consuls also promulgated several important laws, including the Lex Cornelia de Sicariis et Veneficis, which made it illegal to sacrifice children to the gods of Mars or Mercury.   Other events of 239 BC include the death of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major at the hands of Hannibal, who had broken his alliance with Rome; and the election of Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus as dictator for a five-year term.

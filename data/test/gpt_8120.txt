Little Nicholas , also known as Petit Nicolas, is a French folklore character who is said to have been born on April Fools' Day.  The story of Little Nicholas begins on April 1st, when an infant was found abandoned in a basket in a Parisian park. The baby was so small that he was mistaken for a toy and was left to die. However, the child was taken in by a kindhearted woman who took care of him. The woman named the baby Nicholas and she made sure that he had all the necessities, including food and shelter, on April Fools' Day.  The story of Little Nicholas has inspired many artists over the years, including French painter Jean-Honor√© Fragonard, who painted a famous painting of Little Nicholas titled "Nicholas et des gueux" (Nicholas and The Beggars). The painting is currently housed at the Louvre Museum in Paris. Additionally, composer Jacques Offenbach wrote an opera based on the story of Little Nicholas called "Le Petit Nicolas".

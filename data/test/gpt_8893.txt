The Red Scorpions is a gang based in the southern Californian city of Los Angeles. The gang is active in the drug trade and has been involved in a number of violent crimes, including homicide, assault, robbery, and burglary. The gang is also known for its involvement in the Bloods and Crips gangs.  The Red Scorpions began as a small, loosely affiliated group of street thugs in the early 1980s. After a series of turf wars with other gangs in south central Los Angeles, the Red Scorpions emerged as one of the most powerful gangs in the area. In the 1990s, the gang became involved in drug trafficking and began to expand its operations nationwide. In 2007, the Red Scorpions were implicated in a major conspiracy involving the distribution of drugs from Los Angeles to major cities across the United States. In 2009, several members of the Red Scorpions were sentenced to lengthy prison terms for their role in the conspiracy.

John Cameron (May 1764 – September 28, 1828), also known as Ogimauh-binaessih (from the Anishinaabe language: Ogimaa-binesiinh, "chief little-bird") or Wageezhegome (from the Anishinaabe language: Wegiizhigomi, "Who Possesses the Day"), was one of two principal Indigenous Mississauga Ojibwa chiefs, member of the eagle doodem, and farmer.  He was born at Credit River, Ontario, and died at the Credit Mission (Mississauga), Upper Canada. Early life Wageezhegome was born in May 1764 at Credit River, Ontario.  During his youth, he witnessed significant changes in his people's lifestyle, marked by the arrival of thousands of white settlers after the 1776 American Revolution into what is now southern Ontario.  This quickly led to treaty negotiations in which the Mississauga surrendered of much of their hunting territory and fishing grounds. Close contact with the settlers also introduced a series of epidemics, such as the smallpox epidemics in the New World reaching them, against which the Indians had no immunity. As the Mississaugas’ society collapsed, many of the Mississaugas turned to alcoholism.  However, Wageezhegome did not.  Instead, Wageezhegome leaned some English and rudimentary farming skills. He attended a school and adopted the name of John Cameron.  After the death of his tutor David Ramsay, Cameron settled on the flats of the Credit River to farm.

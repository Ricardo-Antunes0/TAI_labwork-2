"Bait a Hook" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Justin Moore. It was released in August 2011 as the second single from his 2011 album Outlaws Like Me. The song became Moore's fifth top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, with a peak at number 17. It also reached number 63 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting sales of over 500,000 units in the United States. Reviews for the track were generally mixed, with critics divided over the premise and its lyrical content. Content The song talks about the male narrator's former lover choosing another man, who he expresses dislike for and is more sophisticated than he is as well as how he cannot do the things that the narrator himself can ("He can't bait a hook, he can't even skin a buck"). He criticizes that man for driving a Toyota Prius and eating sushi and tells her in the chorus that "I ain't even worried, you'll come running back." By the end of the song, he recalls his former love’s temper and realizes it’s better her new lover has to deal with that now instead of him.

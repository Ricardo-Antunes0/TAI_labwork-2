Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is a vector-borne disease caused by the Borrelia bacterium, which is spread by ticks in the genus Ixodes. The most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash, known as erythema migrans, which appears at the site of the tick bite about a week afterwards. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 70â€“80% of infected people develop a rash. Early diagnosis can be difficult. Other early symptoms may include fever, head aches and tiredness. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness or heart palpitations. Months to years later repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally shooting pains or tingling in the arms and legs may develop. Despite appropriate treatment about 10 to 20% of those affected develop joint pains, memory problems and tiredness for at least six months. Lyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected ticks of the genus Ixodes. In the United States ticks of concern are usually of the Ixodes scapularis type and must be attached for at least 36 hours before the bacteria can spread. In Europe Ixodes ricinus ticks may spread the bacteria more quickly. In North America the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, B. bissettiae and B. mayonii cause Lyme disease. In Europe and Asia Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia garinii, B. spielmanii and four other species also cause the disease. The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people, by other animals nor through food. Diagnosis is based on a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. Blood tests are often negative in the early stages of the disease. Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful.

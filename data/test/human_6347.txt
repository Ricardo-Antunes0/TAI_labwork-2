Ruijin class armed merchantman is a class of Chinese armed merchantmen of the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) in its infancy, and participated in several battles against ships of the Republic of China Navy (ROCN) in the early 1950s. These ships are also frequently referred to as gunboats by Chinese. At its infancy, when first established in 1950, PLAN severely lacked large warships needed to defend the coastal regions which had been taken from the Republic of China at the end of Chinese Civil War. To meet the urgent need, a decision was made to strengthen the newly established PLAN with armed merchantmen by converting some of the cargo ships in good condition.    A total of six cargo ships from China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were selected for the conversion, all of which were American coastal freighter from the World War II era. These ships were sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company after the war. They are Design 427 (officially Vessel, Supply, Aircraft Repair, Diesel, Steel, 180') light cargo ships (AKL). All ships were assigned to the Eastern China Military Region Navy (ECMRN, 华东军区海军), the predecessor of East Sea Fleet.

Foraminifera (; Latin for "hole bearers"; informally also called "forams") are a class of unicellular, multicellular, and colonial organisms that produce testate (shell-less) diatoms and ooids.  The word "foraminifera" was first proposed by Swedish naturalist Johan August Arrhenius in 1839. Foraminifera are distinguished from other protists by the presence of testa, a type of hard protective outer shell. The study of foraminifera is known as foraminiferalogy.  The word "foram" is the Latin word for "hole", and the word "foraminifera" is derived from this word. The name was given to this group of organisms because their testa (shells) resemble small holes in rocks or sediments.  Foraminifera are unicellular, multicellular, and colonial organisms. Unicellular foraminifera have one or more cells that are the same size and shape. Multicellular foraminifera contain several thousand cells that are each different in size and shape. Colonies of foraminifera are composed of several thousand individual cells that are all the same size and shape.  Foraminifera produce testate (shell-less) diatoms and ooids. Testate diatoms have a hard protective outer shell made of chitin and calcium carbonate. Ooids are composed of a single layer of cells that grow on

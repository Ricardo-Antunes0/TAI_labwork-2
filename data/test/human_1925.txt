The SL C20 is a type of subway train used in the Stockholm metro, Sweden. Between 1997 and 2004, 271 3-car sets, numbered 2000â€“2270, were delivered to Stockholm by the former Kalmar Verkstad, owned by Adtranz, later acquired by Bombardier Transportation. The C20 is a completely new design and therefore is not compatible with other train types in the system. At , each carriage is longer than the previous train types. To save cost and weight, each unit has only four bogies. The middle car has two bogies. The end parts consist of one bogie each and are connected to the central portion via a semi-trailer-direction. Trolley subframes are made of stainless steel, and are less susceptible to corrosion. When the C20 was sold as the Vagn 2000 , it was marketed as the subway car of the future. All C20 coaches have been given their own names, all proposed by private individuals. Many of the names are linked to Stockholm; for example, coach no. 2001 was christened Birger Jarl.

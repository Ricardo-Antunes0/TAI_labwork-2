Babz Chula (born Barbara Ellen Zuckerman; circa 1946 â€“ May 7, 2010) was an American-born Canadian actress. Chula spent her early childhood in the working-class neighbourhood of Jamaica, N.Y., but her widowed mother, Abby Zuckerman, a booking agent for Leonard Bernstein, moved her two young children, first to Hawaii and then to California, to pursue work in the entertainment field after Chula's father, Larry Zuckerman, an auto mechanic and stock-car racer, was killed in a car race. Growing up in Los Angeles, where her mother eventually remarried, Babz won a scholarship to the California Institute of the Arts and returned to New York after graduation to perform as a folk singer. In 1971 she and her first husband, Phillip Ciulla, relocated to Slocan Valley in British Columbia before moving to Vancouver, where she resumed her acting and singing career under the respelled stage name Chula. Her first major supporting role was in Sandy Wilson's award-winning film My American Cousin.

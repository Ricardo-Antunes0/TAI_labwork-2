History  In 1980, David L. Elwood, Ph.D., founded Elwood Consulting, a provider of pre-employment testing services, as a way of supplementing the income of his private practice in psychology in Columbus, Indiana. In the early 1990s, based on client request, the company's service offerings were expanded to offer a full range of temporary staffing services. By 1996, the company reached $1 million in sales, and the following year a new brand name—Elwood Staffing—was selected to more accurately reflect the business' primary activities. Since 2001, Elwood Staffing has acquired numerous companies, including the 2013 acquisition of SOS Employment Group, which doubled its staff size and service footprint. As of early 2015, Elwood employs nearly 1,000 permanent, full-time employees, operates 180 branches and 70 on-site locations, and generates approximately $900 million in annual revenue.    Elwood is the nation's 10th largest industrial staffing firm and the 18th largest overall staffing firm operating in the country. In terms of individuals and companies served, Elwood's size equates to employment of nearly 29,000 temporary associates daily and staffing partnerships with more than 6,000 client companies annually.

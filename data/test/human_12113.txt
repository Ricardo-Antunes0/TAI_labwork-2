Edwin Gerald Short (July 27, 1919 – July 16, 1984) was an American professional baseball front office executive.  Short worked for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball for over 20 years, including nine seasons as the team's general manager, from August 26, 1961, until September 2, 1970. The White Sox were frequent contenders for the American League pennant during the first six seasons of his administration, but the last three years of Short's tenure saw the team lose 95, 98 and 106 games and play some of its home games in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, because of falling attendance at Comiskey Park. Early career and wartime service After graduating from Roosevelt High School in Chicago in 1937, Short attended Wright Junior College. He worked for the Chicago Tribune and was a publicity man for Chicago Stadium in 1940–41. He then served in the United States Army during World War II, attaining the rank of captain, and was a radio broadcaster after the war, serving as sports director of WJJD-AM, Chicago.  He joined the White Sox in 1950 as publicity director, and later was named the club's traveling secretary. Despite his having served in administrative positions, rather than in baseball operations, he was promoted to succeed Hank Greenberg as the Chisox' general manager late in the 1961 season.  But, as a GM, Short was noted for his bold moves.

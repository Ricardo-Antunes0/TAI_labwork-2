The Sprint was a two-stage, solid-fuel anti-ballistic missile developed by the United States for use against Soviet ballistic missiles. First deployed in 1970, it was the first U.S. missile to use an all-solid propellant. The missile was retired from service in 1988.  The Sprint was designed as a short-range anti-ballistic missile to counter the threats posed by Soviet Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). It was deployed in a wide variety of configurations, including surface-launched and submarine-launched missiles.  The Sprint was replaced by the more advanced Exo-Sprint in the late 1980s.

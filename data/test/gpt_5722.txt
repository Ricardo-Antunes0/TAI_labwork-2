Dundori is a settlement in Kenya's Rift Valley Province. Dundori is located about northwest of Nairobi, about south of the town of Dandora, and about northeast of the town of Marsabit. Dundori has a population of about 2,500 people.  Dundori was settled in the early 1900s by the Maasai people. The Maasai were nomadic pastoralists who herded cattle. The settlement was initially called "Maasai Kopje" (Maasai Hill).  In the early 1990s, Dundori became a focal point for the Kenyan civil war. The village was attacked several times by rebel groups and eventually became isolated from the rest of Kenya. In 1997, Dundori was made part of a peace agreement between the Kenyan government and rebel groups fighting the regime of President Daniel arap Moi.  Today, Dundori is a small settlement with a school, clinic, and several shops. The main economic activity is agriculture. Dundori has a hot desert climate (KÃ¶ppen climate classification "BWh"), with very hot summers and mild winters.

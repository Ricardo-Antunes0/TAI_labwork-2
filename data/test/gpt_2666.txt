Hypselorhachis is a genus of extinct reptile, belonging to the family Pseudodontosauridae. The type species is H. brevirostris. The genus is known from remains found in the Early Cretaceous (about 125 million years ago) of North America. Hypselorhachis brevirostris was originally classified as a species of theropod, but it is now considered a pseudodontosaurid.  Hypselorhachis is known from a single specimen, which was recovered from the Early Cretaceous of North America. The specimen is approximately 75 centimetres long and comprises a partial skull and jawbone. The skull is largely intact, but the jawbone is crushed and distorted, making it difficult to determine the precise dimensions of the skull. It is possible that H. brevirostris was a small-bodied reptile, similar in size to some modern pseudodontosaurids.  Hypselorhachis is one of the oldest pseudodontosaurid genera known from North America, dating back to the Early Cretaceous period. At this time, North America was still joined to Europe via the Bering Land Bridge, so there was considerable diversity and evolution occurring within the pseudodontosaurid family across both continents. H. brevirostris represents a unique form of pseudodontosaurid, distinguished by its short snout and broad skull roof. It is possible that this taxon

Monaincha Church is a 12th-century church in Roscrea, County Tipperary, Ireland. It is registered as National Monument number 125. Location The church is approximately 2.5 km from the town of Roscrea in the barony of Ikerrin and the civil parish of Corbally. It was built on an island in the bog lake of Loch Cré or Logri. The island and lake are described in the 13th-century Norwegian text, The King's Mirror: There is still another quite extensive lake that is called Logri. In that lake is an islet inhabited by men who live a celibate life and may be called, as one likes, either monks or hermits; they live there in such numbers that they fill the island, though at times they are fewer. It is said concerning this isle that it is healthful and quite free from diseases, so that people grow aged more slowly there than elsewhere in the land. But when one does grow very old and sickly and can see the end of the days allotted by the Lord, he has to be carried to some place on the mainland to die; for no one can die of disease on the island. One may sicken and suffer there, but his spirit cannot depart from the body before he has been removed from the island.

Peaked Mountain (pronounced pea-kid) is a nature reserve in the town of Northfield, Massachusetts, United States. The mountain is a remnant of the White Mountains and is part of the New England National Scenic Trail. The mountain is composed of Precambrian quartzite and granite.   The mountain is a popular hiking destination and offers expansive views of the town and surrounding area. There are several trails that ascend to the summit, which can be reached by foot or by a variety of trailheads located throughout the reserve. The summit is also home to a small observatory and a stone shelter built in 1936 as part of the Civilian Conservation Corps.   Peaked Mountain is managed by the Northfield Mount Hermon Conservation Trust, which was established in 1985 to protect the mountain and its surrounding environment. The trust operates a visitor center on the mountain that offers information about the mountain and its natural resources, as well as guided tours of the trails.

Ni(IV) organometallic complexes (Nickel(IV)-centered organometallic complexes) are a form of organonickel compounds which feature a central nickel atom at the +4 oxidation state. These complexes typically need to be supported by non-canonical ligand scaffolds which are usually developed fit-for-purpose. These types of complexes are rare, with only few reports in the chemical literature when compared to lower oxidation state Ni species. These types of high-valent nickel compounds have risen in popularity only in the past decade due to their general instability, challenging characterization, and unique reactivity with organic molecules. Â Organic reactions exploiting the reactivity of nickel typically occur via organometallic Ni0, NiI, NiII, and NiIII intermediate species. These types of species are well studied and have been the subject of several literature reviews, with few regarding NiIV species. Representative preparation  Typically, NiIV complexes are prepared from a much more accessible precursory NiII complex via a two electron oxidation process. The nature of the oxidant required relies heavily upon the ligands surrounding the Ni center, but can range from air to more exotic oxidants, such as S-(trifluoromethyl)dibenzothiophenium triflate, also known as the Umemoto reagent. For example, one of the first isolated NiIV complexes that was used in a cross coupling transformation was reported by Linden and Dimitrov in 2003  and was prepared by simple air-induced oxidation of the following anionic NiII complex:

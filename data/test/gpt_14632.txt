Better Together was the principal campaign for the Scottish independence referendum, 2014. Organised by Scottish National Party (SNP) and partners, it aimed to persuade voters in Scotland to support the union with England and Wales by highlighting the benefits of remaining in the UK.  Better Together was launched on 12 April 2013, with Alistair Darling, then Secretary of State for Scotland, as its main spokesperson. The campaign's main focus was on the economic benefits of the Union for Scotland and England, with a particular emphasis on jobs and growth. However, the campaign also sought to emphasise the social and cultural links between Scotland and England, as well as the shared history of both countries.  The campaign was widely criticised for its poor strategy, particularly its lack of focus on issues such as tuition fees and immigration. As a result, Better Together lost ground in the polls throughout the referendum campaign. On 18 September 2014, Scotland voted 55% to 45% in favour of independence, with turnout at 72%.

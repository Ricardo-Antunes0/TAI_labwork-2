Matisse & Sadko is a Russian DJ and production duo from St. Petersburg, consisting of brothers Aleksandr and Yury Parkhomenko. They are best known for their collaborations with Dutch DJ Martin Garrix in tracks "Dragon", "Forever", "Break Through the Silence",  "Together", "Mistaken", "Hold On" and "Won't Let You Go" which were received positively by critics. History Matisse & Sadko are widely regarded for being one of the front runners of modern Progressive House in the last 10 years. Alexander Parkhomenko and Yury Parkhomenko both started out as solo artists and started working together under the name "Matisse & Sadko" in 2010. Initially releasing tracks on labels Armada Zouk and Refune Music, they were brought into mainstream eyes with the release of "Trio" on 5 March 2012 which was produced with Russian DJ Arty. The track received support from artists Swedish House Mafia, Alesso and Dirty South and was known for inputting "elements from classic trance to create a truly monumental progressive house festival anthem". On 12 August 2013, Matisse & Sadko collaborated with Steve Angello to release "SLVR" on Angello's label Size Records, which marked its 100th release and Size's 10th anniversary. They follow up with notable releases "Sigure", "Stars", and "Persia" before working with Dutch DJ Martin Garrix to release their Break Through the Silence EP, containing the songs "Break Through the Silence" and "Dragon". They moved to a softer sound with the release of "Memories" on 7 September 2015, which was dubbed as a "contemporary piano house" track.

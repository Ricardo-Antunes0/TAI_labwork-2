Swami Ramdev (born Ram Kisan Yadav in 1965), also known among followers as Baba Ramdev , is an Indian yoga guru and businessman, primarily known for popularising Yoga and Ayurveda in India. Ramdev has been organizing and conducting large yoga camps since 2002, broadcasting his yoga classes on various TV channels. He co-founded the Patanjali Ayurved Ltd. with his colleague Balkrishna. In 2010, he announced to form a political party for 2014 General Election. However, he has more recently become a vocal advocate for the BJP. Early life Ramdev is son of Ramniwas Yadav and Gulabo Devi. Both of his parents were farmers. Ramdev comes from the tradition of Arya Samaj. Ramdev declared net worth of his personal assets at around "â‚¹1,100 crore" in 2013. The left side of his face was partly paralysed since at least a few months after his birth, perhaps owing to a congenital disability or a childhood illness. The condition makes Ramdev's left eye squint and wink involuntarily.

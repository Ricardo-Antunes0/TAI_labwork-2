Yuan Qigui (袁齊媯) (405–440), formally Empress Yuan (元皇后, literally "the discerning empress") was an empress of the Chinese dynasty Liu Song.  Her husband was Emperor Wen (Liu Yilong). Yuan Qigui was the daughter of the official Yuan Dan (袁湛) and his concubine, Concubine Wang, but her mother was of such low status that Yuan Dan did not let others know of Yuan Qigui's existence until she was four or five.  She married Liu Yilong when he was still the Prince of Yidu, and she bore him his oldest son Liu Shao and a daughter, Liu Ying'e (劉英娥), later the Princess Dongyang.  After key imperial officials concluded that his brother Emperor Shao was unfit to be emperor, they deposed and killed Emperor Shao in 424 and offered the throne to Liu Yilong.  Liu Yilong accepted, and took the throne as Emperor Wen.  Later that year, he created her empress.

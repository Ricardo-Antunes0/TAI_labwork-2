The Soul Enterprise is often described as more of a fraternity than a band per se. It was founded in 1990, by vocalist Bob Manning from the USA, with other American musicians based in Sweden, such as Jair-Rohm Parker Wells and Bill Bryant. It featured the sounds of old-school Soul music, with a blend of jazz improvisation. In the beginning years, the group's founding members were busy freelancing for other acts besides the Soul Enterprise, such as Dr. Alban and Jennifer Brown. A period of instability followed, with many different substitute musicians playing in the band. The group went through major reforms and a complete change of members followed under the leadership of guitarist Zak Keith in 1992. The new line-up of first-call musicians included some of Stockholm's best, many considered to be world-class musicians, such as Morgan Ågren (drums), Anders Johnsson (bass), Micke Wennergrund (drums), Lasse Pollack (keyboards), Magnus Lindgren (Saxophone), Micke Sörensen (trumpet), Mia Gejrot, Anna Sandberg-Häll and Tonja Hedtjärn (voc). Magnus Lindgren went on to play with Herbie Hancock at age 18; Micke Sörensen went on to work with former Supremes member Mary Wilson. Lasse Pollack toured with Glenn Hughes in Japan.

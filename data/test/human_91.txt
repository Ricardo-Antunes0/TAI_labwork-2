The SkyHook JHL-40 was a proposed hybrid airship/helicopter. On July 9, 2008, Boeing announced that it had teamed up with SkyHook International, a Canadian company, to develop this aircraft.  No further press releases appear after 2009 and Skyhook International has abandoned its domain name registration since 2010 as shown by the Internet Archive. According to company spokespeople, the aircraft would combine the best features of a blimp and a helicopter, and would be capable of carrying a 40 ton load up to  without refueling. At  long, it would classify as the largest helicopter in the world, and would be capable of flying up to  without a load. The craft would use helium to provide enough lift to carry its own weight, and would use four helicopter rotors to lift the load and to propel the aircraft. By using both helium and helicopter rotors, the aircraft can avoid having to jettison helium after unloading.

Law Preservation Party was the name used by a right-wing political party in the United States that existed from 1998 to 2006.  The Law Preservation Party was founded in 1998 by conservative activist and attorney J. Christian Adams, and ran candidates for office in several states, most notably California. The party's platform was designed to protect the constitutional rights of Americans, including the right to bear arms and the right to free speech.  The Law Preservation Party disbanded in 2006, shortly after Adams was fired from his position as Director of Legal Affairs for the Republican National Committee for his involvement in a scandal involving illegal fundraising activities.

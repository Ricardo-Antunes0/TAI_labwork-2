Ottoman music  or Turkish classical music, is the music of the Ottoman Empire, which spanned from 1299 to 1923. The Ottoman classical music tradition was founded by Turkish and Arabic musicians, who brought with them their musical traditions and sensibilities from the Middle East. In the early years of the empire, Ottoman classical music was influenced by Byzantine and Persian music. Over time, Ottoman classical music became increasingly influenced by Turkish folk music.   Turkish classical musicians formed a guild known as the "Oriental Chamber Music Society" in 1768. The society's aims were to promote Ottoman classical music and to preserve the works of Ottoman classical composers. In 1828, a Conservatory was established in Istanbul to train new Ottoman classical musicians. The Conservatory remained active until 1853, when it was closed due to political changes.   The first performance of an opera in the Ottoman Empire took place in 1789. The most famous opera composer of the Ottoman period was Reshad Effendi (1878-1937). Other prominent opera composers of the Ottoman period include Nazim Hikmet (1911-1938) and Ulvi Cemal (1879-1948).   Ottoman classical music is generally melodic and lyrical, with a predominant use of solo voices and chamber ensemble playing. It is often very intricate and virtuosic, featuring extensive use of microtones and unusual harmonic progressions.

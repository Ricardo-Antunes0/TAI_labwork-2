Project 1231 was a hybrid surface combatant and submarine developed in the Soviet Union in the 1960s. It was known as "Dolphin" (Russian: Дельфин) and "diving missile boat" (Russian: ныряющий катер-ракетоносец), and represented a fundamentally new type of ship. It was a missile boat, with a considerable surface speed, yet able to dive and move underwater. The idea of building project 1231 is said to have originated with the Soviet premier, Nikita Khrushchev, who during a visit to a naval base in Balaklava saw submarines and missile boats next to each other. He conceived of an entire fleet able to submerge and thus ensure secrecy in the event of nuclear war. Khrushchev originally ordered the creation of a vessel that could fly, swim and dive. The designers convinced Khrushchev that the construction of a practical aircraft with the surface and sub-surface characteristics he required was impossible. Project 1231 built on the results of work on Project 662, a previous submersible ship: in particular, experience of Project 662 led to the use of hydrofoils for greater surfaced speed.

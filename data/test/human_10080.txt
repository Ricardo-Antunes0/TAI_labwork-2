PhotoDNA is an image-identification technology used for detecting child pornography and other illegal content reported to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) as required by law. It was developed by Microsoft Research and Hany Farid, professor at Dartmouth College, beginning in 2009. From a database of known illegal images and video files, it creates unique hashes to represent each image, which can then be used to identify other instances of those images.  PhotoDNA is primarily used in the identification of child pornography (also known as child sexual abuse material or CSAM), and works by computing a unique hash that represents a given image. This hash is computed such that it is resistant to alterations in the image, including resizing and minor color alterations. It works by converting the image to black and white, resizing it, breaking it into a grid, and then looking at each cell's intensity gradients or edges.

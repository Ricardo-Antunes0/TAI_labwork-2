Lui Collins (born 1950 in Barre, Vermont) is an American sculptor.  Collins received his B.F.A. from the University of Vermont in 1972, and his M.F.A. from the University of Texas at Austin in 1977. He has been a professor at the University of Utah since 1987 and is currently the William C. Odom Chair in Sculpture and Head of the Department of Fine Arts.  Collins' art is characterized by its use of natural materials, often found in unexpected places, to create sculptures that explore the dynamics of space and movement. His work has been exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York City. In 2013 he was awarded a National Medal of Arts by President Barack Obama

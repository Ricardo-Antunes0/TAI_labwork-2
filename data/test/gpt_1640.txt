Laurence 'Larry' Warke (6 May 1927 – 2 December 2007) was an English artist, who worked in painting, sculpture, printmaking and performance.  Warke was born in London, the son of a printer. He studied at the Royal College of Art from 1945 to 1949, then spent two years in Paris, working with Fernand Léger and André Masson. He returned to England and exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1953 to 1958.  Warke's paintings typically depict everyday scenes with an idiosyncratic visual language. His work is noted for its fluid brushwork and expressive use of light and color. Warke's sculptures are often large-scale assemblages of objects that are often difficult to interpret, and they have been exhibited at the Tate Gallery, the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, and the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. He has also performed his work, including a piece called "The Boy With a Thorn in His Side" which consisted of suspended steel balls and was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Warke died in 2007 at the age of 80.

Fadumo Qasim Dayib, nicknamed Deeqo -which means "Gift" in Somali-,  is a Somali politician and the first woman to run for President of Somalia, standing for the November 2016 election. Early life and education Dayib was born in 1972 in Thika, Kenya to Somalian parents. Her mother travelled there after losing eleven previous children to preventable diseases. Her father, who was a truck driver, gave her mother and young brother a lift. They married on their way to Kenya and settled in Thika. Both of her parents were illiterate yet her father spoke several languages. And her mother was an enterprising business woman, who sold tea by the roadside. She had two more siblings born in Kenya. Her parents divorced when she was young. Her family were expelled from Nairobi in 1989 and deported to Mogadishu. Her mother was temporarily imprisoned because her brother was suspected of funding a group opposed to Siad Barre. Dayib's mother sold everything to enable her and her siblings to escape as refugees to Finland, where she has lived since 1990.

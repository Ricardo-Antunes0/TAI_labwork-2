The 1964 Jutland Series (Danish: Jyllandsserien 1964) was the 66th edition of the Danish fifth-tier association football division since its establishment in 1902. Governed by the Jutland Football Association (JBU), the season was launched on 30 March 1964, and the last round of regular league matches concluded on 8 November 1964, with the league championship final being played on 15 November 1964. Silkeborg IF, Vorup Frederiksberg BK, Brande IF and Holstebro BK entered as relegated teams from last season's fourth-tier, while Hobro IK, Vejen SF, Viborg FF (reserves) and Aabyhøj IF Thrott entered as promoted teams from the 1963 JBUs Serie 1. Fixtures for the 1964 season were announced on 13 March 1964, 2½ weeks prior the season's start. The league featured reserve teams for higher ranking league clubs, whose players could indiscriminately be used on both the league and reserve teams, after a quarantine period of one match day. The reserve team of Aarhus GF won the league final, securing their eleventh Jutlandic League Championship title, while IK Aalborg Freja and Silkeborg IF were promoted to the fourth-tier, returning to the nation-wide leagues of the Danmarksturneringen after 27 and one year(s) respectively. At the end of the season, the three clubs with the fewest points in the final league standings, Struer IF, AIA (reserves) and Aabyhøj IF Thrott, were relegated to the 1965 JBUs Serie 1. Centerforward Herluf Bang of Silkeborg IF was the league's top scorer, netting 28 goals, corresponding to 43.75 percent of his own team's goals.

The Gunnison grouse or Gunnison sage-grouse or Gunnison phalarope is a grouse found in the high country of western Colorado, eastern Utah, and southeastern Wyoming in the United States.  This grouse is a good sized bird at about 20 inches long with a wingspan of about 32 inches. It is mainly brown, though there is a white band across the chest. The male has a bright red head, neck, and rump while the female has more subdued colors. They feed on seeds, insects, and other small animals. Gunnison grouse populations have been declining due to loss of habitat and hunting.

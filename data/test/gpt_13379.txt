The Third de Rays Expedition, or simply the de Rays Expedition, was an American scientific expedition led by physicist and astronomer George de Ray Jr. from 1934 to 1936.  The expedition was the second of two expeditions led by de Ray, the first being the 1914â€“1916 Antarctic Expedition. The aim of the expedition was to study the solar system and its planets using a variety of observational methods. The expedition also studied other astronomical objects, including star clusters and nebulae. The members of the expedition were largely amateur astronomers and scientists from various universities and research institutions.  The expedition gathered significant data on the interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, which helped to improve understanding of their physical properties and dynamics. The expedition also discovered new comet families, including the Hyakutake family. De Ray's team also mapped the surface features of Mars, which yielded new information about its geology and climate.  The Third de Rays Expedition was a major achievement in observational astronomy and paved the way for further space exploration.

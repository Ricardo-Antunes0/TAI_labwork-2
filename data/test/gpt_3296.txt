Viva! Health, formerly The Vegetarian and Vegan Foundation (TVF), is a UK-based charity that promotes vegetarian and veganism.  TVF was founded in 1986 by educationalist Dr. T. Colin Campbell and his wife, Dr. Robin Campbell, with the aim of "educating the public about the health benefits of a plant-based diet". The charity has since become recognised as one of the world's leading sources of information and support for vegetarians and vegans, with a worldwide presence in over 30 languages.  TVF runs a number of educational programmes, including the annual Vegetarian Food Festival and the Vegfest UK music festival. In 2017, TVF announced that it had raised Â£3.5 million (USD 4.8 million) to support its work.

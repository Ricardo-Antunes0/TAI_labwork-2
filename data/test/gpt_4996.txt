Nuclear RNA export factor 1, also known as NXF1, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NXF1 gene. The protein functions as a nuclear export factor, transporting mRNAs out of the nucleus.  Nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NXF1 gene. The protein functions as a nuclear export factor, transporting mRNAs out of the nucleus.  NXF1 is a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). NPCs are integral to the regulation of gene expression within the cell. In particular, NXF1 has been implicated in the export of mRNAs from the nucleus. This process is important for the proper functioning of many cellular processes, including DNA replication and transcription.  NXF1 belongs to a family of proteins known as nuclear export factors (NEFs). NEFs are responsible for the transportation of mRNAs out of the nucleus. This process is important for the proper functioning of many cellular processes, including DNA replication and transcription.  NXF1 was first identified as a potential candidate for causing human cancer. However, subsequent studies have shown that NXF1 does not appear to be associated with cancer risk. Moreover, NXF1 appears to play an important role in the regulation of gene expression. Accordingly, it remains unclear whether or not NXF1 is actually responsible for causing cancer.

A rogue DHCP server is a DHCP server that is not operated or controlled by the organization for which it was intended. This can be caused by a malicious DHCP server, or by a DHCP server that has been compromised and is being used to provide unauthorized services.  Rogue DHCP servers can be a security risk for organizations because they can provide unauthorized services, interfere with network traffic, and expose sensitive information. They can also cause disruptions in network operation and cause data corruption.  Organizations should monitor their networks for signs of rogue DHCP servers, and take appropriate action if they are detected. They can also deploy measures to protect themselves from attack by rogue DHCP servers.

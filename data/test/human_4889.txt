Siar Sna… (, "back in the [decade name]") is an Irish documentary television programme, first broadcast in 2005. Each episode covers a particular year in Irish history, using archive material (mostly from RTÉ), on-screen text in English and contemporary music to tell the story of a particular year. It is similar in format to RTÉ's Reeling in the Years, but with less coverage of political and world events and an increased focus on the Gaeltacht, the Irish language, everyday life, culture and the Eurovision Song Contest. Five series have been broadcast: Plans for a 6th series sometime.

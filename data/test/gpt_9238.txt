The Tupuangi Formation is a geological formation in the North Island of New Zealand. It is a sandstone, shale, and limestone succession. The formation is about 145 km long and ranges in width from 2 to 10 km.  The Tupuangi Formation was first identified in the early 19th century by Captain James Cook and named after the village of Tupuangi, near Ohakune, where early investigators collected rocks from the formation. The formation is widespread across the North Island and has been used extensively for geomorphological studies. The majority of the formation is located in the Taranaki Region, but it also extends into parts of the Waikato Region and the Bay of Plenty Region.

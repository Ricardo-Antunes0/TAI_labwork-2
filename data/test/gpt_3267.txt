The NACDA Directors' Cup, known for sponsorship reasons as the FedEx Cup, is an annual golf tournament on the PGA Tour. It is the second-most important event on the tour, behind the Masters Tournament.  The tournament was founded in 1978 as the Del Webb Directors' Cup, named for one of the tour's founders and original sponsors. It was initially played at various courses on the tour, but has been played at the same location each year since 1987 at Torrey Pines in San Diego, California.  The top 50 players on the money list at the end of the season are invited to play in the event. The field is narrowed to 30 by qualifying events held in late January or early February. Players earn points during the regular season based on finishes on the tour's money lists (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.), with more points being awarded for better finishes. The top 20 players at the end of the regular season move on to a two-round playoff that determines the tournament champion.  The FedEx Cup was introduced in 2007 as a new name and sponsor for the Directors' Cup. The prize money is increased each year and is currently $10 million.

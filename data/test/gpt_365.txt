The Chadian village of Dalola was raided by a group of over one hundred al-Qaeda militants on Wednesday, May 11th. The village was located in the Tibesti Region of central Chad and was known to be a stronghold for the radical Islamist group.  The raid began at around 10:00 am local time when the militants, dressed in fatigues and carrying assault rifles, entered the village. They were reportedly followed by around thirty pickup trucks filled with armed fighters. The villagers were taken captive and held at gunpoint until around 4:00 pm, when they were allowed to go free.  The raid marks the latest in a series of attacks by radical Islamist groups in central Chad. In March 2014, al-Qaeda militants attacked a military base in the region, killing over a dozen soldiers and kidnapping two others.

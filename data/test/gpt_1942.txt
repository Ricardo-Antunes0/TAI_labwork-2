George Hardy (26 July 1884, Cottingham â€“ 17 December 1951, London) was a British communist and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain from 1945 to 1951.  Hardy was born in Cottingham, North Yorkshire into a working-class family. He attended Cottingham School and later worked as a draughtsman for a local engineering company. He became active in the Labour Party in the early 1910s and soon became involved in left-wing politics. In 1914, he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), becoming one of its most prominent members.  In 1919, Hardy was arrested and imprisoned for refusing to answer questions about his political activities during World War I. He was released in 1920 and returned to his work as a draughtsman.  In 1924, Hardy was appointed as the CPGB's National Organiser and held this post until 1945. During this time, he played a key role in rebuilding the party after its disastrous defeat in the general election of 1931. In 1945, Hardy was elected General Secretary of the CPGB and held this position until his death in 1951.  Hardy was a driving force behind the party's militant strategy during the 1940s and 1950s and is considered one of CPGB's most important leaders. He is also remembered for his tireless work ethic and his ability to connect with ordinary people.

The Laurentian Society is a society of Trinity College Dublin, named after Saint Laurence O'Toole (Lorcán Ua Tuathail in Irish), and concerned with relevant issues from a Catholic perspective. It was the Catholic society of Trinity College, and it existed with no interruptions between the academic years 1952–53 and 2001–02. During those years, the society held talks on various issues and was engaged in charitable activities. The society played an important role in opposing the ban on Catholics entering Trinity College, and was also influential on other groups of the college, such as the G.A.A. club of Trinity. In September 2011, the Society was revived, being granted provisional recognition by the Trinity College Central Societies Committee. The Society was granted full recognition on 19 March 2013 at the Annual General Meeting of the same Societies Committee. Since then it has steadily grown in size and has an active membership. History The Laurentian was a society of Trinity College Dublin, created during the academic year 1952-3. Trinity News articles differ in the exact year in which it was founded, since one number says that it was created in 1952, whereas other says that it was created in 1953. That the society celebrated its tenth anniversary in 1963 makes the latter date seem more probable.

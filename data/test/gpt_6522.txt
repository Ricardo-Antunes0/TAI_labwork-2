Antenna gain-to-noise-temperature (G/T) is a figure of merit used in the electrical engineering and telecommunications industries to quantify the performance of antennas. It is defined as the ratio of gain to noise power at a given temperature.  G/T is important because it determines how much signal an antenna can extract from a given level of noise. Low G/T antennas are better at extracting signals from noisy environments, while high G/T antennas are better at suppressing noise.

The Arctic World Archive (AWA) is a digital repository of Arctic research papers, reports, monographs, and other materials. The AWA is an open access repository and its collection is searchable by keyword and subject. The AWA was created in 2006 as a joint project of the University of Manitoba Library, the University of Calgary Library, the National Library of Canada, and the Arctic Institute of North America.  The AWA collects and preserves research materials on Arctic topics, including written works, images, videos, maps, and digital objects. The AWA provides access to this collection to researchers, students, and the general public.  The AWA is a collaborative project that relies on the contributions of researchers and library staff from across Canada and the United States. The AWA is funded by the governments of Canada and the United States through grants from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH).

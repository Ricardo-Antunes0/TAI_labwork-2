Universal Systems Language (USL) is a systems-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed for use in large-scale, distributed systems.  USL is intended to be easy to learn and use, while still providing powerful features and supporting a wide range of applications. It is based on the Java programming language, but provides additional features to make it more suitable for systems programming.  USL was developed by the Universal Systems Group at Sun Microsystems, and was first released in February 2006. It has since been released as open source software under the GNU General Public License.

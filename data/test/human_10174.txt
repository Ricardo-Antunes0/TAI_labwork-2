Esther Mae Scott (March 25, 1893 – October 16, 1979) was a Mississippi blues singer, also known as Mother Scott.  After touring during the heyday of the blues, she stopped performing for about four decades before reviving her musical career in the Washington, D.C. area and releasing her only album, Mama Ain't Nobody's Fool (1971). Early life and career  Esther Mae Prentiss Scott was born on March 25, 1893 on Polk Plantation in Bovina, Mississippi. She was the seventh of fourteen children of poor black sharecroppers Henry S. Erves, her step father and Mary Eliza Prentiss Erves her mother. Their family worked on the plantation where their ancestors Monroe Prentiss and Agnes Jane Garrett Prentiss, Mary Eliza's parents, had been enslaved. Esther Mae's biological father was Sam Brown, from a prominent Jewish family in Vicksburg.[6] She began farm work at age five, and food and clothing were so scarce she often suffered frostbite.  Schooling at the Clover Valley Baptist School, a Rosenwald School, was limited to a few winter weeks where farm work could not be done.

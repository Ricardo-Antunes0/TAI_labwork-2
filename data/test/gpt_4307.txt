The Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) is an American aircraft propulsion system used to provide smooth, controlled movement of a manned aircraft. MMUs are mounted on the centerline of an aircraft and are powered by either turbofans or propellers.  MMUs were first developed in the 1950s as a way to improve the controllability of fighter-bombers. They have since been used on a variety of aircraft, including fighters, bombers, and unmanned aerial vehicles. Modern MMUs are capable of providing precise, controlled movement over a broad range of airspeed and altitude. They are also capable of performing sharp turns and other maneuvers that are difficult or impossible to perform with conventional aircraft engines.  MMUs have been widely used in military combat operations over the past several decades. They have been particularly effective in providing precise, controlled movement over difficult terrain environments. They have also been used to provide hover-support for ground troops in combat zones.  The MMU system is currently being developed for use on future generations of fighter aircraft.

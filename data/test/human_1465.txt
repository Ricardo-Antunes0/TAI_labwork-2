Martin Rowan "Marty" Holah (born 10 September 1976 in Hamilton, New Zealand) is a New Zealand rugby union player, who has played for Welsh regional side Ospreys, the Waikato provincial team and the Chiefs Super Rugby franchise. Holah was capped in 36 international test matches for the New Zealand national team, the All Blacks. Holah's contribution to the All Black starting XV was blocked by the emergence of Richie McCaw, the former All Black captain. The Waikato flanker first made his debut for the All Blacks on 16 June 2001 against Samoa at Albany. He is known for his ability to steal the ball in the tackle. While he has been in and out of the All Black squad under the current coaching regime, he has continued to be a Waikato and Chiefs mainstay in his home town of Hamilton. Holah was instrumental in the NZ MƒÅori's defeat of the British & Irish Lions during the 2005 tour at his home ground, Waikato Stadium.

In computer science and mathematical logic, a function type is a data type that represents a particular kind of relationship between inputs and outputs. In other words, a function type specifies the shape of the output and input data, as well as the function that takes those inputs and produces the desired output.  A function type can be thought of as a blueprint for constructing a function. Given an input data type and a function definition, we can use the function type to automatically generate all the necessary code to create and execute the function.  In many cases, functions are defined in terms of other functions. For example, we might define a function to add two numbers together, by specifying its input and output data types as well as its function definition. We can then use this function definition to generate all the necessary code to create and execute the add operation.  Function types are often used in conjunction with templates or specializations to generate specific types of functions. For example, we might define a template for adding two numbers together, but we might also want to generate a function that takes an integer input and returns a double value. We could do this by using a specialization of the add template that takes an integer input and returns a double value.

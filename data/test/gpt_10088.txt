Belgrave St Ives is a commercial art district located in the inner city of Sydney, Australia. It is a small, but vibrant and growing neighbourhood that encompasses a number of galleries, artist studios and businesses.  Belgrave St Ives was founded in the early 1990s by artists and business owners who recognised the unique opportunity that existed to revitalise an inner city area that had been derelict for many years. The district has since developed into a thriving commercial centre with a diverse range of businesses and galleries. Today, Belgrave St Ives is home to some of Sydney's best known art galleries and businesses, as well as a vibrant community of artists and entrepreneurs.  Belgrave St Ives is located in the inner city area of Sydney, just a short walk from the Sydney CBD. It is bounded by Georges Street to the north, King Street to the east, Liverpool Street to the south and Potts Point to the west.

Abkhaz , sometimes spelled Abxaz and also called Abaza , is a Northeast Caucasian language that is spoken in Abkhazia and the Circassians of the North Caucasus. It is also spoken by a small minority in Georgia.  The language was probably first spoken by the Abkhaz people, an ancient Caucasian tribe who inhabited the region of Abkhazia from at least the 3rd century BC. Abkhaz is closely related to Abaza, the language of the Circassians. The two languages share about 90% of their vocabulary, making them very similar. However, Abkhaz has undergone a significant process of borrowing from Russian, which has resulted in a significant difference in pronunciation and grammar between the two languages.  Today, Abkhaz is spoken by around 50,000 people worldwide. It is the official language of Abkhazia, and is also spoken by some minority populations in Georgia (particularly in the regions of Guria and Samtskhe-Javakheti) and Russia (particularly in Tuva and Buryatia).

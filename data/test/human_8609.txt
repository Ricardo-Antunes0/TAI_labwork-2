The VnK line is a railway line in Berlin that formerly connected the Berlin Stadtbahn in Rummelsburg with the Prussian Eastern Railway in Kaulsdorf. The acronym may stand for Verbindung nach Kaulsdorf (connection to Kaulsdorf); Verbindung nach Küstrin (connection to Küstrin) or von und nach (from and to) Kaulsdorf or Küstrin are common interpretations. The western part of the line is still in operation. This single-track electrified line links the Stadtbahn with the Berlin outer ring (, BAR). History  Following the closure of the old Berlin Ostbahnhof in 1882 a connection from the Eastern Railway to the Stadtbahn was needed. A grade separated junction at today’s Ostkreuz, where the two lines separated was not possible because there was insufficient space. Therefore, a flying junction was built two and a half km further east on the Lower Silesian-Märkische Railway near Rummelsburg marshalling yard. An eight kilometre line was built that by-passed Lichtenberg station. It was opened for passenger services on 29 January 1901, primarily for long-distance services.

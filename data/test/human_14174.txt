Del Rey (born December 22, 1959) is an American blues singer and guitarist. Rey specializes in blues and jazz from 1900 to 1950. She developed a Women in American Music concert/lecture series to provide an historical and cultural look at the contribution of women to music in the early 20th century. She is recognized for her syncopated style of guitar and intricate finger picking. Early life Rey grew up with her mother, Eileen, and father, Stan. They lived a bohemian life, moving frequently, until settling down in San Diego, California. Rey became interested in the guitar when her mother bought one in 1964. She was just four years old. Her father bought a second, smaller guitar, and Rey and her mother would follow along to Frederick Noad's guitar lessons on PBS in their trailer park's rec room where there was a television. Rey told a reporter, "I like to tell people that I approach music with an autodidact trailer-park aesthetic." By the age of 7, Rey performed in a talent show.

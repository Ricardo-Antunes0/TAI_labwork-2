Ernest Keith Smith, known professionally as Ernest K. Smith or simply Ernest (stylized in all caps), is an American country music artist. After writing songs for  Morgan Wallen, Jake Owen, Florida Georgia Line, and Chris Lane, he signed a recording contract with Big Loud in 2019. Biography Ernest Keith Smith was born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee. He took an interest in hip hop music at an early age, citing the Space Jam soundtrack and a compact disc of Eminem songs given to him by a friend as his main influences. At age 19, he suffered a heart attack brought on by a viral infection, and developed a drug addiction while in college playing JUCO baseball. After recovering, he moved back to Nashville and began writing and recording songs with Matt Royer, a friend of his who owned a recording studio. This association led to him co-writing the title track of Florida Georgia Line's 2016 album Dig Your Roots. The following year, recording under the mononym Ernest, he began to cut country rap singles: "Dopeman" and "Bad Boy".

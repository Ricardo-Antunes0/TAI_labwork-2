Bane is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writers Chuck Dixon and Doug Moench, and artist Graham Nolan, he made his debut in Batman: Vengeance of Bane #1 (January 1993). Bane is usually depicted as a dangerous adversary of the superhero Batman, and belongs to the collective of enemies that make up the Batman rogues gallery. Possessing a mix of brute strength and exceptional intelligence, Bane is often credited as the only villain to have "broken the bat"; defeating him both physically and mentally. He is a son of another of Batman's enemies, King Snake.  Robert Swenson portrayed Bane in the 1997 film Batman & Robin, while Tom Hardy played him in the 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises. Bane was also played by Shane West in the final season of the FOX television series Gotham. IGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Bane as #34.

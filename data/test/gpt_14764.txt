The plus-one system, also known as a plus one voting system or a plus one proportional representation voting system, is a voting system in which voters are given two ballots, one with a single candidate and the other with a list of candidates. The candidate ranked first on the ballot with the most votes is elected. If there is a tie between two or more candidates, the candidate who received the most votes on the ballot with a list of candidates is elected.

PowerUP boards were dual-processor accelerator boards designed by Accelovation in the late 1990s. They were used by companies such as Microsoft, Intel, and Sun Microsystems to improve performance of their systems.  PowerUP boards were dual-processor accelerator boards designed by Accelovation in the late 1990s. They were used by companies such as Microsoft, Intel, and Sun Microsystems to improve performance of their systems. The boards typically consisted of a pair of processors, each with its own memory and I/O controller. The processors could be run in parallel to increase performance.  The PowerUP boards were not without their problems. They were often unstable and had a reputation for being temperamental. Additionally, they were expensive and difficult to use.

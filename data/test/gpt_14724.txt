Cartilage Baroque, or Bruskbarokk and similar terms, is a style of Baroque art which emerged in the 17th century in the Netherlands. Characterized by its over-the-top use of cartilage, it is generally considered a sub-genre of Mannerism.  The style is named after the characteristic usage of cartilage as a medium for sculpture, painting, and other art forms. The term "cartilage" derives from the Latin word for "joint," and refers to the porous, fibrous nature of cartilage tissue. This gives cartilage pieces a natural appearance and allows for a greater degree of flexibility and movement than bone or other solid materials.  The style is often associated with the Dutch Golden Age, although it was not limited to Dutch artists. Other notable practitioners of Cartilage Baroque include Nicolaes Pieterszoon Berchem and Hendrick de Keyser.

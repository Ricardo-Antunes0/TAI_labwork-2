In electronics, a cross section, cross-section, or microsection, is a prepared electronics sample that allows analysis at a plane that cuts through the sample. It is a destructive technique requiring that a portion of the sample be cut or ground away to expose the internal plane for analysis. They are commonly prepared for research, manufacturing quality assurance, supplier conformity, and failure analysis. Printed wiring boards (PWBs) and electronic components and their solder joints are common cross sectioned samples. The features of interest to be analyzed in cross section can be nanometer-scale metal and dielectric layers in semiconductors up to macroscopic features such as the amount of solder that has filled into a large, 0.125in (3.18mm) diameter plated through hole. Preparation Cross sections can be prepared by several methods typically chosen based on the scale of the feature of interest because the technique affects the smoothness of the final polish. Smoother polishes allow analysis of smaller features, but can also take longer or can be more expensive to prepare. Cross sectioning hard materials such as alumina might require a different technique than a soft material like gold or soft plastic.

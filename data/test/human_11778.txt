Independence Day UK is a one-hour BBC Radio 1 science fiction special, first broadcast on 4 August 1996. Production  The show is a spin-off of the movie Independence Day and depicts the movie's alien invasion from a British perspective. None of the original movie cast appear in the radio show. The movie's producer Dean Devlin gave Dirk Maggs permission to produce an original radio adaptation provided that he did not reveal certain details of the movie's plot, and that he did not depict the British as saving the day. Maggs wrote, produced and directed the programme, with Devlin credited as "Creative Consultant". To achieve authentic aircraft sounds, Maggs' crew recorded aircraft and cockpit interior sounds at an RAF base. The programme's tagline is, "It's the Battle of Britain all over again, but this time our enemies aren't just unstoppable. They're inhuman". The drama was subsequently released on audio cassette by Polygram.

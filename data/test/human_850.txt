Germanos Dimakos (, 1912–2004) was a Greek priest and prominent member of the Greek Resistance during World War II, fighting in the ranks of the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS). He is best known by his nom de guerre, Papa-Anypomonos (Παπα-Ανυπόμονος, "Father Impatient"). He was born Georgios Dimakos in 1912, in the village of Agrydaki in Gortynia. He was ordained a deacon on 29 July 1934, adopting the name Germanos. In 1940, when Greece entered World War II, he was the hegumenos of the Agathonos Monastery near Ypati in Phthiotis. After the start of the Axis Occupation of Greece, he became a member of the Communist-sponsored National Liberation Front (EAM), and served as chairman of the community of Dadi. On 14 May 1943 at the village of Koukouvista he met Aris Velouchiotis, the chief captain of ELAS, EAM's guerrilla wing. Henceforth Dimakos became a close associate of Velouchiotis, following him in his tours around Greece. His bravery and zeal earned him the sobriquet Papa-Anypomonos from Velouchiotis himself.

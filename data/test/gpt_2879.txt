Retributive justice is a theory of punishment that holds that the goal of criminal justice is to restore the victim's victimhood. It is an alternative to the retributive theory of punishment, which holds that the goal of criminal justice is to punish the offender. Retributive justice theory is based on the idea that people have a natural inclination to punish those who have harmed them or their kin.  Retributive justice has been criticized for its lack of consistency and its reliance on notions of revenge and retribution. Critics also argue that it leads to excessive and unfair punishment, especially when applied to minority groups or those who are not criminal masterminds.

Sharko is a Belgian indie pop-rock band formed in 2002. The band has released three studio albums: "Sharko" (2005), "In the Middle of Nowhere" (2007), and "Deeper" (2009).  Sharko was founded in 2002 by singer-songwriter Koen De Coster, guitarist Jef Van den Bergh, bassist Rudy De Wilde and drummer Johan Van Herck. The band's name is derived from the character Sharky from the American animated television series "The Simpsons".  The band's debut album, "Sharko", was released in 2005. The album was well-received by critics, who praised its catchy melodies and eclectic mix of indie pop and rock. In 2007, Sharko released their second album, "In the Middle of Nowhere". The album was again well-received by critics, who praised its dark yet melodic sound and De Coster's emotive vocals.   The band's third album, "Deeper", was released in 2009. The album received mixed reviews from critics, who felt that it lacked the cohesion of the band's previous albums. However, they praised De Coster's soaring vocals and the band's more experimental sound.   In October 2010, Sharko announced that they were breaking up after a decade of activity.

Rumbula  is an air base located in the municipality of Rumbula in southeastern Estonia. It is operated by the Estonian Air Force. Rumbula Air Base is a secondary airbase for fighter aircraft and attack helicopters.     The airbase has two asphalt runways, measuring 3,048 metres (10,668 ft) and 2,440 metres (7,920 ft), with apron and taxiway surfaces of 150 metres (490 ft). There is also a small helipad measuring 50 by 25 metres (164 x 82 ft).   Rumbula Air Base was originally constructed as a Soviet airfield in the early 1940s. It was occupied by the Germans during World War II, and served as a base for Luftwaffe fighters during the Battle of Estonia. After the war, it was reopened by the Soviets and used as a training facility. The base was seized by Estonian forces during the 1991 Soviet coup d'Ã©tat attempt and became an Estonian airbase. It was briefly closed in 2000 due to financial problems, but reopened two years later.  Rumbula Air Base has been used for training pilots for fighter aircraft and attack helicopters since 1991. The airbase has also been used for aerial photography and mapping operations. In 2000, Rumbula Air Base was used to launch Operation Bright Star, a military operation conducted in response to the September 11 attacks. The airbase has also been used for humanitarian missions, such as delivering food to people in need in Africa

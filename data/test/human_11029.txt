Laini (Sylvia) Abernathy was an American artist and activist. She was an important figure in Chicagoâ€™s Black arts movement, often working in collaboration with her husband, photographer Fundi (Billy) Abernathy. Career  Abernathy studied at the Illinois Institute of Technology, located on the South Side of Chicago. As a young artist, Abernathy was commissioned by Delmark Records to design album covers for jazz records, including such iconic releases as Sound (1966) by Roscoe Mitchell of the Art Ensemble of Chicago, Sun Ra's Sun Song (1966), and Leon Sash's I Remember Newport (1967), some of which featured Fundi's photographs. Abernathy's designs typically worked with Art Deco-inspired typefaces and vibrant color block patterns mirroring the deconstructive, forward-thinking nature of the music. She was working during a time when few African-Americans held positions of creative authority on the visual side of the predominantly Black jazz movement -- jazz album design, popularized by designers such as Paul Bacon and Reid Miles, made use of bold abstract forms and negative space to subvert the racist stereotypes associated with black music in previous decades. This art scene, however, was largely male-dominated and white, despite the progressive cultural integration it advocated.

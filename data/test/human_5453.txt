#LetHerSpeak (also known as #LetUsSpeak) is an Australian campaign to amend evidence legislation so as to allow victims of sex crimes to be publicly identified if they choose. The campaign was founded in November 2018 by journalist Nina Funnell with support from End Rape on Campus (EROC), News Corp Australia and Sydney law firm Marque. It focuses on changes to the law in Tasmania, Victoria and the Northern Territory. As of 2021, the parliaments of Tasmania and the Northern Territory had amended their laws accordingly. Laws relating to victims of sex offences  All Australian jurisdictions provide some form of legal protection to prevent victims of sexual offences from being publicly identified. However, as of 2018, laws in Tasmania, Victoria and the Northern Territory were framed in such a way as to make it impossible for victims to identify themselves in the media without a court order. The campaign characterised these provisions as "gag laws".

Shunning can be the act of social rejection or isolation of someone by a group. It may be done with the purpose of causing social pain or embarrassment, typically to someone who is considered to be a member of the group, such as a family member, friend, or romantic partner.  Shunning can be carried out in public or private and may be verbal or nonverbal. It can occur unintentionally or with malice aforethought. Shunning may be motivated by a desire to protect the group from contamination, to punish an offender, to maintain social order, or to maintain community values.  Shunning has been used throughout history as a form of punishment and discrimination. It is still used today in some religious and cultural groups. Shunning can have a significant impact on the individual being shunned and can cause feelings of loneliness, isolation, and depression.

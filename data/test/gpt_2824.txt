Blok M is a business and shopping complex in the heart of Jakarta, Indonesia. It is located in the business and shopping district of Kota Administrasi Jakarta Barat and is adjacent to the Jakarta Convention Center.  Originally known as the Kota Administrasi Jakarta Barat Complex, Blok M was originally developed in the late 1990s as a mixed-use complex comprising a shopping mall, office tower, hotels and apartments. The mall opened in 1999 and featured over 180 stores, including international retailers such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Zara.  In 2007, the complex was renamed Blok M after the Indonesian political party MPRS (Partai Persatuan Pribumi Republik Indonesia) acquired a majority stake in the complex. The party used the complex to campaign for its candidates during the 2009 Indonesian presidential election.  The mall was closed for renovations from November 2014 to March 2015. During this time, Zara replaced Saks Fifth Avenue as one of the mall's flagship tenants. The mall reopened with a new look on March 29, 2015.  The complex features a number of restaurants, including Starbucks and KFC. It is also home to several luxury retailers, including Prada, Bottega Veneta and Lululemon Athletica.

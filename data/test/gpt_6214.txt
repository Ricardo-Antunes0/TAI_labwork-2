HD 47366 is the Henry Draper Catalogue designation for a star in the constellation Andromeda. It has an apparent magnitude of 4.94 and is approximately 220 light years away from Earth.  HD 47366 is a white dwarf star, the final stage of the life of a sun-like star. It is about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun and has a radius of just 0.04 R â˜‰ . This makes it one of the smallest stars known, but also one of the most compact and dense.  The star is relatively young, having been born about 5 billion years ago. It is still burning hydrogen fuel in its core, but it will eventually run out of fuel and collapse into a black dwarf.

Emily Hale (27 October 1891 – 12 October 1969)  was an American speech and drama teacher, who was the longtime muse and confidante of the poet T. S. Eliot.  Exactly 1,131 letters from Eliot to Hale were deposited in Princeton University Library in 1956 and were described as one of the best-known sealed archives in the world for many years. Per Hale's instructions, the letters were opened in January 2020, 50 years after Hale's death. The same day, Harvard's Houghton Library issued an unexpected statement that Eliot had prepared in 1960, to be opened when Hale's archives were released.  Princeton then released Hale's summary of their relationship. Early life and career Hale was born in East Orange, New Jersey, on 27 October 1891.  Her father was the Reverend Edward Hale, an architect who became a Unitarian Minister and taught at Harvard Divinity School. Her mother Emily (née Milliken) had become a "permanent mental invalid" after the death of her infant son, and Hale was brought up by her aunt Edith Perkins and her uncle, the Unitarian Minister Reverend John Carroll Perkins. The couple lived in Boston but spent their summers from 1930 to 1939 in Chipping Campden, England, with Hale also attending.

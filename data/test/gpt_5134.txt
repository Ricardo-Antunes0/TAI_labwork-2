The  was a Japanese Shinkansen high-speed train type operated by Japanese National Railways (JNR) between 1964 and 1996. The name "100 series" is a reference to the 100 km/h (62 mph) top speed of the trains. The trains had stainless steel bodies with a green, blue, or silver livery.  The 100 series Shinkansen were the first high-speed trainsets built in Japan. They were also the first Japanese Shinkansen to be built with stainless steel bodies. The 100 series sets were primarily used on the Tokaido Shinkansen between Tokyo and Shin-Osaka, and on the Sanyo Shinkansen between Shin-Osaka and Hakata.  The 100 series sets were replaced by the new 200 series Shinkansen in 1996.

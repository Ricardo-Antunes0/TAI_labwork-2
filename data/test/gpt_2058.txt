Madhouse is a 1974 British horror film directed by Peter Jackson and produced by Ralph Winter. It is a loose remake of the 1932 British horror film of the same name, with elements from other horror films such as The Haunting and The Exorcist.  The film tells the story of Dr. David Serling (John Carradine), a mentally unstable doctor who is committed to a mental hospital after being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. He is soon transferred to a new facility, Madhouse, which is run by the sadistic Dr. Arthur Arden (Donald Pleasence). Serling begins to terrorize the patients and staff of Madhouse, including Nurse Kitty (Caroline Munro) and orderly Eddie (Jim Broadbent).  The film was shot in England and received mixed reviews from critics. However, it has since gained a cult following and has been cited as an influence on later horror films.

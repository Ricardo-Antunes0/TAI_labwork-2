The Enborne rises in the Cotswolds, near the village of Upper Slaughter, and flows south-west past the villages of Nethercot, Coldharbour, and Aston Rowant before turning north-west and joining the Thames near Abingdon. The river has a length of 74 miles (119 km).  The Enborne is popular for fly fishing, and has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

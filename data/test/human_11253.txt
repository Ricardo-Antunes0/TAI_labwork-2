McCartney Peak is a 6,784-foot-elevation (2,068 meter) mountain summit located within Olympic National Park in Jefferson County of Washington state. Part of the Olympic Mountains, McCartney Peak is situated 18 miles south of Port Angeles, and set within the Daniel J. Evans Wilderness. Topographic relief is significant as the southwest aspect rises 3,800 feet (1,160 meters) above the Lost River in approximately 1.5 mile. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains north into headwaters of the Lillian River, east to the Gray Wolf River via Cameron Creek, and west to the Elwha River via Lost River. The nearest higher neighbor is line parent Mount Cameron,  to the southeast. History McCartney Peak was in the late 19th century known as "Lillian Peak," and nearby Windfall Peak was originally named McCartney Peak, for a trapper known as "Old Man McCartney" who frequented this area. Over the subsequent years, mapping errors resulted in present-day names and locations.

Richard Adolphus Came (23 April 1847 – 19 July 1917) was an architect who initially worked in London. He gained commissions over a wide area of south-eastern England and according to one source these included "boarding schools, private residences, country houses in Lancing, East Grinstead, Tunbridge Wells, Broadstairs, Ealing, Child's Hill, Hampstead, Winkfield and Windsor." He also designed warehouses in Cannon Street, Cheapside, Bread Street and  the German Athenæum Club at 19 Stratford Place in London, as well as electric light stations in Pall Mall, St. James, Richmond and Preston. Came was also a surveyor laying out building developments and acted as a property developer, owning and selling some of the buildings. Two of his major developments were connected with horse-racing. At Newmarket he developed two areas of the town and at Ascot he designed most of the residences facing the racecourse. In 1874–76 he was the architect for the Grantham and Kesteven Hospital. Subsequent to this in 1887 he was commissioned to survey and lay-out Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire as a new Spa Town. By about 1895 he had moved his architectural practice to Woodhall and was responsible for designing many of the half timbered Arts and Crafts style buildings in the town. He was a pupil of Matthew Digby Wyatt and trained at the Royal Academy School. He qualified as an ARIBA on 6 November 1871.

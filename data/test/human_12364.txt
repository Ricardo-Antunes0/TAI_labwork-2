Josiah Eustace Dodd (16 August 1856 – 30 January 1952) was an Australian pipe organ builder, based in Adelaide. History  Dodd was born in Richmond, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, to Ebenezer Daniel Dodd (c. 1827–1889) and his wife Johanna Dodd, née Moloney, later of Castlemaine, Victoria. He was educated at St Stephen's Church School in Richmond, and apprenticed to the organ builder George Fincham of Bridge Road, Mitcham. In 1881 Fincham sent Hobday and Dodd to South Australia to open a branch of the business in Adelaide, setting up in Twin Street.  Arthur Hobday (1851–1912) was a son of Justin Harold "Harry" Hobday, organist and choir master at Christ Church, Geelong until 1870 when he left for Trinity Church, Geelong. Hobday was apprenticed to Fincham, then acted as client manager, organising plans and specifications, contracts, final inspection, tuning and voicing, then chasing up payments. Hobday and Dodd complemented each other, with Dodd taking responsibility for construction and finish, for which Hobday had no talent. Their first commission was a new organ for the Norwood Baptist Church, taking their old one (ex-Christ Church, North Adelaide) as part-payment; its component parts were later used to upgrade or refurbish other instruments.

Rishikesh Narayanan (born 1974) is an Indian mathematician and computer scientist who specializes in algebraic geometry and geometric computing.  Narayanan was born in 1974 in Chennai, India. He received his bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Madras in 1998, and his master's degree and doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley in 2002 and 2005, respectively.  From 2002 to 2005, Narayanan was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, where he worked on the geometry of curves and surfaces. He has since been a faculty member at the University of Maryland, College Park.  Narayanan's research focuses on algebraic geometry and geometric computing. He has made significant contributions to the theory of elliptic curves, projective spaces, Riemannian geometry, geometric variational calculus, and algorithms for geodesics and Voronoi diagrams.  Narayanan is a fellow of the American Mathematical Society, the Association for Computing Machinery, and the Mathematical Society of Japan. In 2018 he was awarded the Fields Medal by the International Mathematical Union.

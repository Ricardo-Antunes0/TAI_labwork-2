Tandem Computers, Inc. was the dominant manufacturer of minicomputers in the early 1980s.  Tandem was founded in 1968 by two former employees of DEC, Bob Metcalfe and Tom Metcalfe. The company's first product was the Tandem 6000, which debuted in 1971. In 1975, the company introduced the Tandem 8100, which became the world's first commercially available minicomputer with a graphical user interface (GUI). The Tandem 8100 was followed by the Tandem 9000 in 1977.  The Tandem line was later superseded by the Tandem MAX series, which featured improved performance and more advanced features. The company ceased operations in 1992.

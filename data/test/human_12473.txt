Gregoras Iberitzes  was a Byzantine nobleman and senior military leader of the early 10th century. Life Gregoras' surname may suggest an Iberian origin. He was related by marriage to the powerful Doukas clan, with whom his career was intertwined. He was almost certainly the father-in-law of Constantine Doukas, son of general Andronikos Doukas. When the latter rose in revolt in the winter of 906/7, possibly due to the machinations of the powerful eunuch Samonas, Gregoras, who at the time held the supreme military position of Domestic of the Schools, was sent by Emperor Leo VI the Wise (reigned 886â€“912) to confront the Doukai, who had taken refuge in the fortress of Kabala near Ikonion. Andronikos however called upon the Arabs for aid, and in spring of 907, an army under the Abbasid governor of Tarsus, Rustam ibn Baradu, arrived to help him. According to al-Tabari, Andronikos managed to take Gregoras captive, defeat his troops, and flee to the Abbasid Caliphate.

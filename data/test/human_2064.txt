The Eastern Iron Brigade, also known as the Iron Brigade of the East and First Iron Brigade, was a brigade of infantry, that served in the Union Army's Army of the Potomac, during the American Civil War. For much of its service, it was designated as the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, I Corps. Among its commanding officers were General John P. Hatch and General Walter Phelps Jr. Noted for its reliability in battle, the brigade developed a reputation which remained after it was disbanded late in the war, due to its annihilation from extremely high casualties. Origin of Eastern Iron Brigade The Eastern Iron Brigade consisted of the 22nd New York, 24th New York, 30th New York, 14th Regiment (New York State Militia), and 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters. During the Fredericksburg Expeditions the brigade had two cavalry regiments attached to it, the 2nd New York Cavalry Regiment ("Harris Light") under the command of Lt. Col. Judson Kilpatrick (originally of 5th New York Zouaves) and the 6th New York Cavalry. The pair of cavalry regiments were later sent back to their normal divisions.

Llys Helig  is the name of a large, flat-topped mountain in the Brecon Beacons National Park, south Wales. At 1,087 metres (3,560 ft) it is the highest peak in the national park.  The name Llys Helig is derived from the Welsh word "llys" meaning "church", and "helyg" meaning "high". The mountain is thought to have been named after a church on its summit that was said to be dedicated to Saint Helig. The church no longer exists, but the name of the mountain remains.  The mountain can be seen from many parts of the Brecon Beacons National Park, and is well known for its impressive views. It is a popular destination for walkers and climbers, and is a popular spot for photo opportunities.

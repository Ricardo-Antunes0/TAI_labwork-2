 People Ravindra Jain (1944â€“2015), an Indian musicologist and composer, was one of the most influential figures in contemporary Hindustani classical music. He was also a prolific recording artist, and his recordings of Hindustani classical music have been hailed as classics.  Jain was born on 3 September 1944 in Bombay (now Mumbai), Maharashtra, India. He received his early training from his father, an accomplished musician and scholar, and later studied with the late Pt. Lalgudi G Jayaraman. Jain's early works were based on traditional ragas and talas, but he soon developed a unique voice of his own, blending traditional melodic patterns with elements of modern music. He has written several books on Hindustani classical music, including "Raga Maalika" (1986) and "Tala: The Music of India" (2004).  Jain died on 14 March 2015 in Mumbai, after a long illness.

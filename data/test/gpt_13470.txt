The Little Sur River is a           located in the Central Coast region of California. The river is approximately 18 miles long and flows through the communities of Carmel-by-the-Sea and Monterey. The Little Sur River is a designated Wild and Scenic River.  The Little Sur River is a perennial stream that forms in the Sierra Nevada, near Bear Valley Lake, and flows eastward into Monterey Bay. The river receives its name from the Little Sur Mountains, which are visible on either side of the river as it flows through Carmel Valley.  The lower part of the river is narrow and steep-sided, with many rapids and cascades. The upper section of the river is wider and less turbulent, with a more meandering course. The river passes through a number of small canyons and tributaries before flowing into Monterey Bay.  The Little Sur River has been used for irrigation since Spanish colonial times. The lower section of the river has been extensively developed for hydroelectric power production, while the upper section remains largely undeveloped. The Little Sur River is a popular recreational destination, with kayaking, rafting, fishing, and swimming available throughout its length.

Hugh Owen Whitby (12 April 1864 â€“ 1 January 1937) was an English cricketer who played for Yorkshire County Cricket Club from 1882 to 1897. A right-handed batsman and occasional wicket-keeper, he was known for his hard batting and astute captaincy.  Born in Wakefield, Yorkshire, Whitby made his first-class debut for Yorkshire against Kent in 1882 at the age of 23. He played regularly for Yorkshire over the next few years, scoring over 1,000 runs each season. In 1888, he scored a century against Lancashire, becoming one of only two batsmen to achieve this feat in a single season for Yorkshire. He also captained Yorkshire during the 1888 season, leading them to victory in the County Championship.  Whitby's batting declined in the 1890s, but he remained a regular player for Yorkshire. In 1897, he scored his final first-class century, a knock of 111 against Cambridge University. After retiring from playing cricket, Whitby served as captain of the Yorkshire Second XI and later as honorary secretary of the Yorkshire Cricket Board. He died at the age of 71 in 1937.

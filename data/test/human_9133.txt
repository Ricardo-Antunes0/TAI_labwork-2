Eugénie Droz (born Eugénie Zahn 21 March 1893 – 19 September 1976) was a Swiss romance scholar, editor publisher and writer, originally from the Suisse Romande.   She created the Librairie Droz, a publisher and seller of academic books, at Paris in 1924, moving the business to Geneva at the end of the war. Biography    Laure Eugénie Zahn was born at La Chaux-de-Fonds in the francophone northwest of Switzerland.   Her father, Frédéric Zahn, was a well known member of the business community in the town, where he worked as an editor. In 1900 the family relocated to nearby Neuchâtel.   Here she completed her secondary education and obtained a teaching diploma.   Between 1910 and 1913 she taught French at the Moravian Institute of Gnadenberg in Silesia, taking the opportunity at the same time to perfect her German.   Returning to Neuchâtel in 1913, she was admitted to the Université de Neuchâtel where during the next three years she studied successfully for her degree.   She was a pupil of Arthur Piaget, who also became a good friend.   He encouraged her to study the history of ancient poetry and renaissance literature. It is apparent that the second volume of Piaget's work "Jardin de Plaisance et Fleur de rhétorique, d'Antoine Vérard (vers 1501)", which was published only in 1925, subtitled "Introduction and notes" and signed off by E.Droz and Arthur Piaget, was largely the work of Piaget's erudite pupil.   The compilation of 672 verses, ballads, sounds, rondeaux etc., many of them anonymous, was described in an obituary of Eugénie Droz as an "inestimable contribution to mid-century French literature" ("contribution inestimable aux lettres françaises du milieu du siècle").

The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, known as the Russo-Ukrainian War, commenced in February 2014. It originated from Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity, during which Russia annexed Crimea and supported separatists in the Donbas region. Over the initial eight years, the conflict escalated with naval clashes, cyber warfare, and increased political tensions. In February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, expanding its occupation of Ukrainian territory. The conflict traces back to early 2014 when protests in Ukraine led to the ousting of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. Subsequently, unrest erupted in eastern and southern Ukraine, and Russian troops, initially unmarked, occupied Crimea, leading to its annexation after a controversial referendum. In April 2014, Russian-backed militants seized control of towns in the Donbas region, establishing the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), sparking the Donbas war. Throughout the conflict, Russia covertly supported separatists, while denying direct involvement, although Russian troops were observed in combat. Despite the signing of the Minsk II agreements in February 2015 aimed at resolving the conflict, they were never fully implemented, resulting in a prolonged stalemate with intermittent ceasefires but no lasting peace. Tensions escalated in 2021 when Russia amassed troops near the Ukrainian border and within Belarus, with President Vladimir Putin expressing irredentist views and opposing Ukraine's NATO membership. On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a "special military operation" in Ukraine under the pretext of "demilitarizing and denazifying" the country, leading to widespread international condemnation and sanctions against Russia. Despite initial advances, Russia faced fierce Ukrainian resistance, abandoning its attempt to capture Kyiv in April. Ukrainian forces began reclaiming territory, prompting Russia to declare the annexation of partially occupied regions in September, further exacerbating the crisis. The conflict has led to a significant refugee crisis and tens of thousands of casualties, with inconclusive offensives and counteroffensives prolonging the suffering and instability in the region.

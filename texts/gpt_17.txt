After setting a new championship record in their preliminary race, the US mixed 4x400m team repeated their feat in the final, clocking 3:10.73 – the quickest ever time outside of a global championship. Matthew Boling initiated the charge with a strong start on the first leg, passing the baton to Lynna Irby-Jackson. She maintained their lead, but Lieke Klaver of the Netherlands and Rhasidat Adeleke gained ground, with Adeleke delivering a sensational split of 48.45 – the fastest ever recorded at the World Relays. Willington Wright widened the gap on the third leg before Kendall Ellis secured victory as the anchor. Behind them, Femke Bol fended off a fierce challenge from Ireland’s Sharlene Mawdsley to claim second place in 3:11.45, just 0.08 seconds ahead of Ireland. Nigeria narrowly missed the podium but set an African record of 3:12.87. In the opening event of the evening, The Bahamas secured victory in their heat during the Olympic qualifying round two, shattering their national record with 3:12.81 – a time that would have placed them fourth in the final. The Bahamas’ success was attributed partly to their strategic running order. Steven Gardiner propelled the team to an early lead, while Shaunae Miller-Uibo, another Olympic champion, brought them across the finish line with a split of 49.54. Other heat winners included Germany (3:13.85) and Great Britain & NI (3:12.99), while Jamaica, Switzerland, and Ukraine secured Olympic qualifying spots as runners-up in their heats. Gabby Thomas emerged as a key asset for the USA, competing in both the victorious 4x100m and 4x400m teams. Thomas ran an impressive split of 49.58 before passing the baton to Bailey Lear, who, alongside Alexis Holmes, secured gold for the USA in 3:21.70 – the second-fastest time in World Relays history. In the battle for positions, Poland claimed second place in 3:24.71, followed by Canada in third with 3:25.17. The Olympic qualifying round two also saw Jamaica, the Netherlands, and Belgium secure places for the Paris 2024 Games. Botswana made history by winning the men’s 4x400m final in 2:59.11, becoming the first African nation to achieve this feat at the World Relays. Italy led initially, but Botswana surged ahead, with Letsile Tebogo delivering a remarkable split of 43.72. South Africa and Belgium battled for second place, with South Africa ultimately clinching it in 3:00.75. Despite their strong showing, the USA missed the final due to a disqualification in the heats, but they secured victory in the Olympic qualifying round two with a time of 2:59.95. France faced disappointment as they narrowly missed out on an Olympic berth, despite being the sole medallists from last year’s World Championships. However, there remain two spots in each relay discipline for top-performing nations within the qualifying window.

Outside their flimsy tent, the children hear the snarls of dogs. Rehab Abu Daqqa's seven children huddle close to her, finding solace in her presence amid the chaos. Together, they've witnessed things that defy easy explanation. How does a child articulate the dread of knowing that just yards away, animals are desecrating a grave? Words fail in the face of such horrors in Rafah's emergency cemetery. Rehab Abu Daqqa struggles to describe the emotions gripping her children. "Scared," she says simply, but it's an inadequate word. Their fear is mingled with revulsion and incomprehension. They've seen dogs feasting on bodies and stumbled upon grisly remnants. These children, once part of a stable home and community, are now refugees in a place haunted by death. "The dogs don't let us sleep," laments Rehab Abu Daqqa. Packs of feral canines roam the cemetery, scavenging for sustenance among the shallow graves. Some families have resorted to makeshift barriers to protect their loved ones' resting places. Exhausted and haunted, Rehab Abu Daqqa and her children endure the relentless terror. "I refuse to accept this as our reality," she declares. Her son, instead of playing games, draws graves with lifeless figures. This is the plight of Palestine's childrenâ€”miserable doesn't even begin to describe it. Rafah, swollen with displaced families, grapples with disease and hunger. Disease outbreaks compound the misery, exacerbated by overcrowding and malnutrition. For these refugees, Rafah represents the end of the line, with Egypt's closed border offering little hope of escape. Rehab Abu Daqqa has fled multiple times, and the specter of yet another displacement looms. Israeli forces threaten further incursions into Rafah, escalating tensions and prolonging the suffering. Political rhetoric fuels the fire, with promises of destruction overshadowing any hope of peace. "Where can they go?" asks Dr. Rik Peeperkorn of the World Health Organization, echoing the desperate question of countless refugees. In Rafah, amid the rubble and despair, there are no easy answers.

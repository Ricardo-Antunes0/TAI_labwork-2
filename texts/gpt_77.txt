Imagine this: You unexpectedly come into possession of a spare concert ticket, leading to a serendipitous encounter with a globally renowned pop sensation. Amidst the electric atmosphere of one of the world's most iconic music festivals, their gaze pierces through the dazzling stage lights to meet yours in the crowd. What follows is a whirlwind romance across the European leg of their sold-out tour. It's a fantasy that has captivated the human imagination for decades, depicted in films like "What Price Hollywood" and "A Star is Born," which explored the dynamics of relationships between the famous and the non-famous nearly a century ago. In 1999, the genre reached new heights with the release of "Notting Hill," a seminal film by Richard Curtis, where Julia Roberts, a graceful American movie star, falls for Hugh Grant, a bumbling British bookstore owner. More recently, "Starstruck," both a 2010 Disney Channel original movie and a 2021 BBC Three series, brought the joys and struggles of dating a celebrity to the small screen. Now, director Michael Showalter revitalizes this timeless trope with "The Idea of You," available on Amazon Prime as of May 2nd. Based on the 2017 novel by Robinne Lee, the film is set in Los Angeles, the epicenter of ambitious dreams, and stars Anne Hathaway as Sol√®ne Marchand, a glamorous 40-year-old art gallery owner and divorced mother of one, alongside Nicholas Galitzine as Hayes Campbell, the 24-year-old heartthrob of the fictional boy band du jour, August Moon.

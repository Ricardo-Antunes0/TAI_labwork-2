Rúben Filipe Marques Amorim, born on January 27, 1985, is a Portuguese football icon who currently serves as the manager of Sporting CP in the Primeira Liga. Throughout his playing career, Amorim showcased his versatility, excelling as a midfielder, right-back, and winger. He made significant contributions to clubs like Belenenses and Benfica, where he earned an impressive collection of ten major titles, including three league championships, one Taça de Portugal, five Taças da Liga, and one Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira. Amorim also represented Portugal in two FIFA World Cups, accumulating 14 international caps. Transitioning from player to coach, he commenced his coaching journey at Casa Pia in 2018, later moving to Braga B before ascending to the first-team role in December 2019, where he secured the 2020 Taça da Liga. In March 2020, Sporting CP acquired Amorim's managerial services in a landmark transfer valued at €10 million (£8.65 million), making him one of the most expensive managers in history at the time. Under his leadership, Sporting CP clinched both the Taça da Liga and the Primeira Liga, ending a 19-year league title drought and earning him the Manager of the Year accolade for the 2020–21 season. Continuing his success, he guided the team to another Primeira Liga triumph in the 2023–24 season.

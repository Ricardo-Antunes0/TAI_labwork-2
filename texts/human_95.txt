Tom Brady took some major hits by his former teammates, comedians and even Kim Kardashian during Netflix’s “The Greatest Roast of All Time” on Sunday. The “GROAT” special was hosted by Kevin Hart and livestreamed on Netflix. The former NFL quarterback was roasted about his divorce from Gisele Bündchen, his appearance, his two retirements, “deflategate” and his FTX investment scandal, among many other sore topics. Comedian and notorious “Roastmaster General” Jeff Ross served as a producer and kicked off the event, quipping Brady is an example to future generations that “if you work hard, eat right, film the other team’s practices, deflate the balls and have the NFL make new rules just for you, then you, too, can be the third most famous guy in a Dunkin’ Donuts commercial.” At one point, Ross joked that as a rookie with the Patriots, Brady said to team owner Robert Kraft, “‘I’m the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?’” It was an apparent reference to Kraft’s arrest on charges of solicitation of prostitution at a Florida massage parlor in 2019. The charges were later dropped. Brady, who took most of the joking in stride, took issue with that one. He got up from his seat and told Ross, “Don’t say that s— again,” in a comment picked up by the microphone. Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman, Randy Moss and Drew Bledsoe, who all played with Brady throughout his career, and former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick took turns roasting the MVP. Peyton Manning also appeared. Gronkowski talked about how “psyched” he was to have both Brady and Belichick together, saying, “everyone thinks you guys hate each other but I saw it firsthand, you two are exactly alike. You’re both hardasses that hate fun.”

A Romanian court has ruled that the trial of Andrew Tate, a self-proclaimed "misogynist" online influencer accused of human trafficking and rape, may proceed. Tate, along with his brother Tristan and two Romanian citizens, faces charges including human trafficking, rape, and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women, all of which they deny. While the court in Bucharest, Romania's capital, has not yet set a trial date, the Tate brothers have lodged an appeal against the ruling, according to Mateea Petrescu, a spokesperson for the brothers. Romanian prosecutors allege that the Tate brothers lured victims by falsely promising them relationships or marriages. Eugen Vidineac, the lead counsel for the Tate brothers, criticized Friday's ruling, stating that it lacks legal justification, and confirmed that they have submitted a robust appeal. Adrian Sandulescu, the attorney for the other two suspects, also denounced the decision, calling it unlawful and unfounded. In March, a Romanian court approved the extradition of the Tate brothers to the United Kingdom, but specified that this would only occur after the conclusion of their trial in Romania. The Tate brothers, both former professional kickboxers, were initially arrested in December 2022 and remained in police custody until April 2023, after which they were placed under house arrest. Andrew Tate gained internet notoriety in recent years, amassing billions of views on TikTok with his controversial views on male dominance, female submission, and wealth.

Cambridge, situated in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, USA, is a thriving suburb within the Greater Boston metropolitan area, nestled just across the Charles River from its bustling neighbor, Boston. According to the 2020 U.S. census, its population stands at 118,403, making it the county's most populous city, the fourth-largest in Massachusetts, following Boston, Worcester, and Springfield, and the ninth-most populous in New England. Its name pays homage to the University of Cambridge in England, a significant hub of Puritan theology, which influenced the town's founders. Harvard University, established in 1636, holds the distinction of being the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States, situated in Cambridge. Alongside Harvard, the city hosts other esteemed institutions like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Lesley University, and Hult International Business School. Radcliffe College, initially a separate women's liberal arts college, merged with Harvard in 1999 after its founding in Cambridge in 1879. Notably, Kendall Square, adjacent to MIT in the eastern part of Cambridge, has earned the moniker "the most innovative square mile on the planet," thanks to its dense concentration of emerging startup ventures since 2010. Established in December 1630 during the colonial period, Cambridge was among the pioneering cities in the Thirteen Colonies, playing a crucial role in the American Revolution. In May 1775, approximately 16,000 American patriots congregated in Cambridge Common to strategize military action against British forces in response to the Battles of Lexington and Concord. On July 2, 1775, just two weeks after the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia officially formed the Continental Army and appointed George Washington as its commander, Washington arrived at Cambridge Common to assume leadership of the Patriot troops encamped there. Many of these soldiers participated in the successful Siege of Boston, which effectively immobilized British troops, compelling their eventual retreat from Boston. Cambridge Common holds a place of honor as the birthplace of the Continental Army.

On February 24, 2022, Russia initiated a military invasion of Ukraine, escalating the ongoing conflict known as the Russo-Ukrainian War, which commenced in 2014. This invasion marked the largest assault on a European nation since World War II and resulted in devastating consequences. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians and hundreds of thousands of military personnel were estimated to have been casualties of the conflict by June 2022. Russian forces swiftly occupied approximately 20% of Ukrainian territory, displacing millions of Ukrainians both internally and externally. By April 2023, over 8 million Ukrainians had been internally displaced, and more than 8.2 million had fled the country, triggering Europe's most significant refugee crisis since World War II. The war's environmental toll, labeled as ecocide, exacerbated food shortages worldwide. Preceding the invasion, Russian troops amassed near Ukraine's borders while Russian officials denied any intentions of aggression. Russian President Vladimir Putin justified the invasion as a "special military operation" to support the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, which had been engaged in conflict with Ukraine since 2014. Putin promoted irredentist ideologies, challenging Ukraine's sovereignty and falsely alleging governance by neo-Nazis. The invasion unfolded across multiple fronts, with Russian forces launching airstrikes and ground assaults from various directions. Ukrainian authorities responded by enacting martial law, mobilizing their forces, and severing diplomatic ties with Russia. While Russian troops faced resistance and logistical challenges on the northern front, they captured key cities such as Kherson and Mariupol in the south. Despite successful counteroffensives by Ukraine in late 2022 and 2023, which included the retaking of some territories and cities, the conflict persisted with sporadic violence and limited territorial gains. International condemnation was swift, with the United Nations General Assembly passing resolutions denouncing the invasion and demanding Russian withdrawal. Numerous countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus, while providing humanitarian and military assistance to Ukraine. The International Court of Justice intervened, ordering Russia to suspend military operations, and the International Criminal Court initiated investigations into potential war crimes, abduction of children, and genocide. Putin and other military commanders faced arrest warrants for their alleged roles in these atrocities.

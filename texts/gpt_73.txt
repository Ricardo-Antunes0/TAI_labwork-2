A tense calm now blankets much of the Middle East, with Gaza being the notable exception, following a series of alarming missile, rocket, and drone exchanges between Israel and Iran in recent weeks. The specter of an imminent regional conflict has diminished, as both sides suggest they have strategically restored deterrence and bolstered national morale enough to quell criticism from hawks and hardliners, at least for the time being. For now, it seems neither Israel nor Iran desires a direct confrontation, opting instead to acknowledge the recent exchanges of attacks, albeit without addressing their root causes. The absence of casualties in either country appears deliberate, underscoring both sides' capacity for greater destruction and loss of life if they so chose. However, this does not signal an end to the confrontation. On the contrary, akin to how the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on October 7 ignited tensions leading to the first-ever direct Iranian strikes on Israel and subsequent Israeli retaliation, the struggle between these powers seems poised to escalate to a new, more ominous phase.

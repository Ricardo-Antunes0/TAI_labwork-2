During Netflix's "The Greatest Roast of All Time," Tom Brady found himself at the receiving end of some brutal jabs from his former teammates, comedians, and even Kim Kardashian. Hosted by Kevin Hart and livestreamed on Netflix, the event dubbed "GROAT" spared no punches as it delved into topics ranging from Brady's divorce from Gisele BÃ¼ndchen to his appearance, retirements, "deflategate," and the FTX investment scandal. Jeff Ross, renowned as the "Roastmaster General," served as a producer and set the tone with his sharp humor, jokingly portraying Brady as an example of success through controversial means. Ross quipped about Brady's meticulous approach to the game, including an allusion to the infamous "deflategate" scandal and the subsequent rule changes seemingly tailored for him. One of Ross's barbs aimed at Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, elicited a strong reaction from Brady, who interrupted the roast to express his disapproval. Among Brady's former teammates, Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman, Randy Moss, and Drew Bledsoe, along with former coach Bill Belichick, didn't hold back either. Gronkowski playfully highlighted the perceived similarities between Brady and Belichick, while Peyton Manning made a surprise appearance to add to the comedic onslaught. Despite the barrage of jokes, Brady mostly took the ribbing in stride, showcasing his ability to laugh at himself alongside his peers.

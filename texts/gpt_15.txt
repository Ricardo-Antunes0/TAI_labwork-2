Erik ten Hag has outlined the essential qualities he seeks in potential Manchester United signings this summer, emphasizing the importance of a "winning attitude." Having already engaged in discussions with the United board regarding summer recruitment, Ten Hag expressed optimism about the initial talks. Since his appointment in May 2022, the Red Devils have invested approximately Â£380 million in players, with further spending anticipated in the upcoming transfer window. With Sir Jim Ratcliffe poised to oversee changes following his 25 percent takeover confirmation in February, United could target reinforcements in key positions such as center forward, No. 8, center-back, and right-back. Looking ahead to the summer window, Ten Hag stressed the significance of acquiring players with strong mental fortitude and a winning mentality, essential qualities for performing under pressure at a club of United's stature.

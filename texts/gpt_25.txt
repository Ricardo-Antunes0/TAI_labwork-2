Rhythm and blues, often shortened to R&B or R'n'B, emerged in the 1940s from African-American communities. Initially coined by record labels to market music to African American audiences, it described a genre with a strong, pulsating beat, influenced by jazz and rock. Bands of the 1950s to the 1970s typically featured pianos, guitars, bass, drums, saxophones, and background vocalists. Lyrically, R&B delved into African-American history, addressing pain, the pursuit of freedom and joy, and struggles with racism, oppression, relationships, economics, and aspirations. Over time, the term "rhythm and blues" evolved. Initially applied to blues records in the early 1950s, it broadened in the mid-1950s to encompass music that had evolved from electric blues, gospel, and soul, contributing to the rise of rock and roll. British groups in the 1960s and 70s were sometimes labeled as R&B bands. By the 1970s, "rhythm and blues" came to include soul and funk. In the late 1980s, a contemporary form emerged, blending R&B with pop, soul, funk, disco, hip hop, and electronic music, known as "contemporary R&B."

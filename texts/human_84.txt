Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced Wednesday that he was cancelling his public duties until next week to “reflect” on whether to continue leading the government, just hours after a Spanish court said it had opened a probe against his wife. In the surprise move, Sanchez said on X that he would announce his decision on whether to remain as prime minister next Monday, in an appearance before the news media. Sanchez, a socialist, said on X that the court had opened the probe against his wife, Begoña Gomez, “at the request of a far-right organization called Manos Limpias (Clean Hands) to investigate the alleged crimes of influence peddling and corruption in her business dealings.” Sanchez said his wife would defend herself and cooperate with the judicial system. Sanchez said the complaint by Clean Hands appeared to be based on “alleged information” published by what he termed some “right and far-right” digital media. Sanchez said “I need to stop and reflect” about “if I should continue leading the government” or step down.

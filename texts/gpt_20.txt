President Joe Biden recently made remarks regarding immigration policies in various countries, including Japan and India, during a campaign fundraising event. He grouped these nations alongside Russia and China, suggesting they are resistant to immigration. This statement follows earlier affirmations of strong alliances with Japan and India. Despite concerns over human rights and religious freedoms in India, the White House clarified that Biden intended no offense. Criticism of Biden's remarks has emerged from various quarters. Elbridge Colby, a former US deputy assistant secretary of defense, emphasized the importance of respecting allies like Japan and India, rather than applying narrow perspectives. While Japan, India, and China have relatively low numbers of foreign-born workers, Russia heavily relies on migrant labor, particularly from Central Asia. The White House defended Biden's comments, emphasizing his broader point on US immigration policy and reaffirming the value of alliances and partnerships. However, analysts suggest that such remarks may be poorly received in India, especially amid nationalist sentiments. Nonetheless, they are unlikely to significantly impact US-Indian relations in the long run. Japan, known for its restrictive immigration policies, has recently moved to address population decline by welcoming foreign workers. Biden's remarks come amidst his administration's increasingly stringent approach to immigration, a stance that has drawn criticism from both sides of the political spectrum.

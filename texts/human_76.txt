Police launched an investigation Wednesday into the fire that tore through Copenhagen’s famous stock exchange building, causing the collapse of its spire and damaging centuries-old artwork and architecture. The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city’s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through the building – known locally as Børsen – from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a “complicated process.” Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already “conducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.”

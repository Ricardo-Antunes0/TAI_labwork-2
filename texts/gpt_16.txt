Tonight, Manchester United aims to reclaim their winning streak as they take on Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park in the Premier League. Their recent 1-1 draw against Burnley extended their streak of underwhelming performances to just two wins in their last nine league matches. Consequently, they slipped down the table, overtaken by both Newcastle United and Chelsea, who secured commanding victories over the weekend. Newcastle thrashed Burnley 4-1 at Turf Moor, while Chelsea demolished West Ham United 5-0 at Stamford Bridge. Now, Newcastle sits sixth, two points ahead of United, who find themselves in eighth place, trailing Chelsea on goal difference. United understands the importance of clinching three points against Palace tonight to reclaim sixth place and edge ahead of Newcastle. However, securing victory away from home in the league has proven challenging for them, having not achieved it in over two months. Meanwhile, the club continues to be linked with various players as the transfer window approaches.

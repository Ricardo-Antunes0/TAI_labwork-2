The Château de Kaysersberg (also: Schlossberg) is a castle in the municipality of Kaysersberg, in the district of Hochtaunuskreis, in Baden-Württemberg, southern Germany.  The castle was first mentioned in a deed from 1157. The present building dates back to the 15th century. It was built by the counts of Kyburg and became their main residence. The Kyburg family retained ownership until the early 18th century. In 1732 it came into the possession of Prince Eugene of Savoy, who later sold it to the duke of Württemberg.  Today, the castle is a popular tourist destination, with a range of tours and activities available.

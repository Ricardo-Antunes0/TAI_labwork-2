Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method of transferring development rights in a project from the original developer to another party. The term is most commonly used in the context of real estate development.  The purpose of TDR is to provide a way for the original developer to relinquish control of a project without having to sell the property or give up any ownership rights. This can be useful when the original developer no longer has the financial resources or interest in continuing to develop the property.  TDR can be used in a variety of different projects, including real estate, infrastructure, and software development. Typically, TDR is used when the original developer wants to focus on other projects, or when the property is not selling well.  There are a number of different methods for transferring TDRs. The most common approach is through an agreement between the original developer and the new party. Other methods include giving away ownership of the property directly, or transferring development rights through a subsidiary company.  There are several advantages to using TDRs.

Second, TDR can help ensure that the new party has access to all of the necessary information about the project. This can help ensure that the project is completed as planned, and that any changes made by the new party are properly reflected in the

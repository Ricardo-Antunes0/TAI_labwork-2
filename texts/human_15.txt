Erik ten Hag has revealed the three key traits he wants from any new Manchester United signing this summer, including players with "winning attitudes". On Thursday, Ten Hag admitted he has already met with the United board to discuss summer recruitment and believes those initial talks have been positive. The Red Devils have spent around £380million on players since Ten Hag was appointed in May 2022 and even more could be spent this transfer window. Sir Jim Ratcliffe is expected to oversee a summer of changes at United after his 25 per cent takeover was confirmed and ratified in February. A new centre forward, No.8, centre-back and right-back are among the areas United could target as they try and strengthen their squad following a below-par campaign. Looking ahead to the summer window, Ten Hag told his pre-match press conference: "In the two winter windows, we almost didn't do any business. In the first, we brought in Wout Weghorst and Marcel Sabitzer on loan, which were two good ones, but this winter we didn’t do anything. "We tried but it didn’t happen. It had to do with the budget and Financial Fair Play. I think every manager wants players with winning attitudes and a great mentality, big personalities to perform under stress. In this club it's extremely important to perform under stress."

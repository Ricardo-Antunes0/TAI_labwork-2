Walking is widely lauded as an accessible and effective form of exercise with numerous health benefits. Studies have shown that achieving at least 2,300 steps per day can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Additionally, weight-bearing exercises like walking contribute to the prevention of osteoporosis. However, despite its health advantages, some experts argue that walking alone may not constitute high-quality exercise. Melissa Boyd, a certified personal trainer and coach at Tempo, an online training platform based in San Francisco, emphasizes that while walking is essential for basic bodily function, it may not yield the desired fitness results, particularly for those aiming for a "beach body" as promoted by social media influencers. Boyd encourages her clients to recognize three distinct types of movement essential for overall health and fitness. Firstly, there's foundational movement, which includes activities like walking, stretching, and bending that are necessary for daily bodily function. Secondly, there's athletic movement, which involves more intense workouts aimed at improving fitness or training for specific sports. Lastly, social movement encompasses enjoyable activities like dancing or playing sports with others, which foster social connections and contribute to overall well-being. By understanding the different types of movement and incorporating a balanced approach into their routines, individuals can maximize the benefits of exercise while promoting overall health and fitness.

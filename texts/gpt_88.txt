A Belgian man was cleared of drunk driving charges on Monday due to his diagnosis of auto-brewery syndrome (ABS), a rare medical condition characterized by the body's production of alcohol, according to his lawyer. Anse Ghesquiere stated that her client, who coincidentally works at a brewery, was confirmed to have ABS by three independent medical examinations. The verdict, as reported by Belgian media, highlighted that the defendant, unnamed in accordance with local legal protocols, did not exhibit signs of intoxication. The Bruges police court, which acquitted the man, did not immediately respond to inquiries from Reuters. Lisa Florin, a clinical biologist at Belgian hospital AZ Sint-Lucas, explained that individuals with ABS produce alcohol similar to that found in alcoholic beverages, but typically experience reduced effects. She noted that ABS is not congenital but can develop in individuals with preexisting intestinal conditions.

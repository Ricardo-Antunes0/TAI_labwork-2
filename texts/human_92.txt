German team Bayer Leverkusen extended its miraculous unbeaten run to 48 games on Sunday after thrashing Eintracht Frankfurt 5-1 in the Bundesliga. Unlike many matches this season, Leverkusen never trailed and had five different scorers – Granit Xhaka, Patrik Schick, Exequiel Palacios, Jeremie Frimpong and Victor Okoh Boniface – in the blowout victory at Frankfurt’s Deutsche Bank Park. The win means that Leverkusen has now equaled the record for the longest unbeaten run across all top-level matches since the introduction of European competition, according to UEFA. The club shares the mark with Portuguese giant Benfica, which set the record between 1963-65. Leverkusen will have the chance to break the record on Thursday when it plays Roma in the second leg of its Europa League semifinal. The all-time mark of 62 games unbeaten was set by Scottish club Celtic from 1915-1917, however, those matches were all in the domestic league. “Our level, our consistency throughout the season is great. But we are always moving forward. We are always concentrating on the work and improving,” Leverkusen manager Xabi Alonso told reporters after Sunday’s match.

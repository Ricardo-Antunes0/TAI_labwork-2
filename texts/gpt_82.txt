Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued directives for Russian forces to conduct rehearsals involving the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons, citing perceived "threats" from the West. Since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Putin has consistently hinted at the possibility of employing tactical nuclear weapons against Western adversaries. However, Monday marked the first public announcement of their use in military drills by Russia. The Russian defense ministry stated, "During the exercises, various procedures will be practiced regarding the preparation and utilization of non-strategic nuclear weapons." These weapons, commonly referred to as "tactical," are designed for use in battlefield scenarios and possess lesser destructive capabilities compared to strategic nuclear weapons, which have the potential to devastate entire cities. The decision to conduct these drills comes in response to what Russia perceives as "provocative statements and threats" from Western officials. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov noted that these threats had escalated to "unprecedented levels." French President Emmanuel Macron recently reiterated his stance on the situation, emphasizing the potential risks posed by Russia to European security and neighboring countries. Macron emphasized, "I'm not ruling anything out because we are dealing with a party that is also not ruling anything out. My strategic objective is clear: Russia cannot emerge victorious in Ukraine. A Russian victory in Ukraine would undermine security in Europe. Who can confidently claim that Russia would stop there?"

In a recent ruling by an Indian judge, a woman's complaint regarding her husband's alleged commission of "unnatural sex" was dismissed, highlighting a legal gap in India where marital rape is not criminalized if the wife is over the age of 18. This decision, issued by the Madhya Pradesh High Court, underscores a longstanding issue in Indian law, where campaigners have been advocating for reforms to address marital rape. However, these efforts face opposition from conservatives who fear that state intervention could disrupt traditional marital norms. The challenge to this law has been progressing through the country's legal system, with the Delhi High Court delivering a divided verdict on the matter in 2022, leading to an appeal filed in the Supreme Court, which is pending. The case in question involved the woman reporting to the police that her husband had engaged in "unnatural sex" with her shortly after their marriage in 2019, citing Section 377 of India's penal code. This section historically targeted non-consensual "carnal intercourse against the order of nature," including consensual same-sex relations, until the Supreme Court decriminalized homosexuality in 2018.

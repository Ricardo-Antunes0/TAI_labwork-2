The term "vegetable" lacks a precise botanical definition. However, in horticulture, the field devoted to cultivating garden crops, a vegetable is typically described as any herbaceous plant—a plant with fleshy tissue that completes its life cycle within a single growing season—whose parts are consumed as a primary component of a meal, whether cooked or raw, rather than as a snack or dessert, according to Reiners. The distinction between vegetables and fruits, particularly in the United States, was legally established in a 19th-century US Supreme Court case, which deemed the tomato a vegetable. Although vegetables typically encompass roots, stems, and leaves of plants, caution is advised against consuming all parts of every plant. For instance, rhubarb serves as a prime example; while its fleshy stalks are edible, its leaves are toxic, as noted by Reiners. To ensure safety, it is advisable to consume plants commonly recognized as vegetables in grocery stores. "We understand the health benefits associated with vegetables, including their vitamin and mineral content, as well as their fiber content," Reiners remarked. "Furthermore, the vegetables available at grocery stores, farmers' markets, or grown at home are generally considered safe for consumption," he added.

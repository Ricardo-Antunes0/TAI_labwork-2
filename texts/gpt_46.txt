Formed in London in 1970, Queen emerged as a British rock band led by Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, and later joined by John Deacon. Initially influenced by progressive rock and heavy metal, Queen diversified their style, blending in elements of arena rock and pop rock. Prior to Queen, May and Taylor were part of Smile, with Mercury joining in 1970 and suggesting the band name. Their self-titled debut album came in 1973, but it was Queen II in 1974 that marked their UK chart debut. International success followed with albums like Sheer Heart Attack and A Night at the Opera, featuring the iconic "Bohemian Rhapsody". Hits like "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions" solidified their status as stadium rock icons by the early 1980s. Mercury's last public performance was in 1986, and he revealed his AIDS diagnosis in 1991, passing away the next day. Queen's legacy continued with albums like The Miracle and Innuendo. After Mercury's death, the band released Made in Heaven. Deacon retired in 1997, while May and Taylor occasionally performed together. Since 2004, they've toured as "Queen +" with vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert. With estimated sales of 250 to 300 million records, Queen remains one of the world's best-selling music artists. They've received numerous awards, including induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and were honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2018.

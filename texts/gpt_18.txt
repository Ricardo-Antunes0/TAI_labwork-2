In recent migration updates, leading independent human rights experts issued a plea on Thursday urging an end to the practice of detaining migrant and asylum seeker children upon entry into the European Union (EU). Among these experts is Gehad Madi, the Special Rapporteur on Migrant Rights, who emphasized that detaining children based on their parents' migration status consistently violates their rights. This call coincides with the imminent implementation of a new migration and asylum pact by the EU's 27 Member States, pending approval by the EU Council in Brussels. These measures, slated to take effect in 2026, include the establishment of national mechanisms to ensure the protection of human rights during the screening process of migrants and asylum seekers at borders. "The act of seeking asylum should not result in punishment, nor should migration be treated as a criminal offense," emphasized the independent experts in a joint statement.

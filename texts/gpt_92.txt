Bayer Leverkusen, the German football team, continued its remarkable unbeaten streak by securing a resounding 5-1 victory against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga. In contrast to previous matches this season, Leverkusen maintained control throughout the game, with five different players - Granit Xhaka, Patrik Schick, Exequiel Palacios, Jeremie Frimpong, and Victor Okoh Boniface - contributing to the scoreline at Frankfurtâ€™s Deutsche Bank Park. This triumph not only solidifies Leverkusen's exceptional form but also equals the record for the longest unbeaten run in top-level matches since the inception of European competitions, as recognized by UEFA. This milestone places Leverkusen alongside Portuguese powerhouse Benfica, which achieved the same feat from 1963 to 1965. Leverkusen now eyes the opportunity to surpass this record as they face Roma in the second leg of their Europa League semifinal. While the all-time unbeaten record of 62 games, held by Scottish club Celtic from 1915 to 1917, remains unmatched, Leverkusen's focus remains on continuous improvement. Manager Xabi Alonso emphasized the team's commitment to progress, stating, "Our level of consistency throughout the season is exceptional. However, our focus remains on advancing and refining our performance."

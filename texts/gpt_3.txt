Sporting Lisbon, under the leadership of Ruben Amorim, clinched the Portuguese Primeira Liga championship as their city rivals Benfica faltered in a crucial match against Famalicao, losing 2-0 on Sunday. Benfica, the reigning champions from the 2022-23 season, aimed to secure a victory to keep their title hopes alive, but were thwarted by second-half strikes from Jose Luis Rodriguez and Zaydou Youssouf. This defeat pushed Benfica into second place in the league standings, trailing Sporting by eight points with just two matches remaining. Sporting's triumph marks their 20th league title and their first since the 2020-21 season. Their path to victory was sealed with a commanding 3-0 win over Portimonense on Saturday. Amidst the celebrations, attention has turned to the future of manager Ruben Amorim. The 39-year-old tactician has been rumored to be eyeing a move to the Premier League this summer, with recent speculation linking him to the managerial post at West Ham, potentially succeeding David Moyes. Despite reports in April suggesting a verbal agreement with Liverpool to replace Jurgen Klopp, Amorim has denied such claims.

Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria (December 1, 1949 – December 2, 1993) was a Colombian figure known for his roles as a drug lord, narcoterrorist, and briefly as a politician. He established and led the infamous Medellín Cartel, earning the moniker "the king of cocaine" due to his immense wealth, estimated at around $30 billion at the time of his demise. Operating during the 1980s and early 1990s, Escobar's cartel dominated the cocaine trade into the United States. Born in Rionegro and raised in Medellín, Escobar's early life saw him engage in various criminal activities, including selling illegal goods and participating in theft. He transitioned into the drug trade in the 1970s, quickly rising through the ranks to establish the Medellín Cartel. By the 1980s, Escobar's influence extended across continents, with his cartel facilitating the bulk of cocaine shipments into the United States. Despite his criminal enterprises, Escobar also ventured into politics, securing a seat as an alternate member of the Chamber of Representatives in the 1982 Colombian parliamentary election. He utilized his position to foster goodwill through community projects, earning popularity among local residents. However, Escobar's reign of terror was met with opposition from Colombian and U.S. authorities, leading to numerous attempts to capture him. In 1991, he surrendered to authorities but negotiated a deal that spared him extradition to the United States. Escobar was housed in his own private prison, La Catedral, until his escape in 1992. His escape sparked a nationwide manhunt, ultimately leading to his death at the hands of the Colombian National Police in 1993. Despite the atrocities associated with his reign, Escobar garnered mixed sentiments in Colombia, with some viewing him as a benefactor due to his philanthropic efforts among the poor. Escobar's legacy continues to spark debate, with his life and deeds serving as inspiration for various forms of media, including film, television, and music. His former estate, Hacienda Nápoles, has been repurposed into a theme park, further adding to the complexities surrounding his controversial legacy.

The transition of Giancarlo Esposito into leading roles is a promising development, yet his latest vehicle, "Parish," doesn't quite showcase his talents effectively, much like his previous outing in "Kaleidoscope." Set in New Orleans, the AMC drama relies heavily on familiar themes of retired criminals pulled back into the underworld, with Esposito's character, Gray Parish, reluctantly drawn back into the fray as a getaway driver. Despite nursing old wounds, Parish agrees to a risky job to alleviate financial strain, leading him into a dangerous web of criminal conflicts. Adapted from the UK series "The Driver," "Parish" struggles to break free from clich√©s, although it gains traction through Zackary Momoh's compelling portrayal of a Zimbabwean gangster named the Horse. While Esposito's intensity is undeniable, the series doesn't offer much deviation from his previous roles, including his acclaimed performances in "Better Call Saul" and "Breaking Bad." Despite premiering after "The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live," "Parish" fails to shift out of neutral, lacking the momentum to fully capitalize on its promising premise.

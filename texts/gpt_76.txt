On Wednesday, police initiated an investigation into the devastating fire that engulfed Copenhagen's iconic stock exchange building, resulting in the collapse of its spire and extensive damage to historic artwork and architecture dating back centuries. As the blaze continued to rage into Wednesday afternoon, surpassing the 24-hour mark since its inception, both authorities and residents of the Danish capital began to grapple with the loss of a cherished landmark. Local firefighters persisted in their efforts to extinguish the flames that had ravaged the building, locally known as BÃ¸rsen, since early Tuesday, penetrating all levels and culminating in the collapse of its distinctive dragon-tail spire, a symbol synonymous with the city. Although the building's walls remain intact, the interior has suffered significant damage, and a portion of the roof has caved in. Utilizing cranes, firefighters diligently directed streams of water into the structure. Concurrently, Copenhagen police launched an investigation on Wednesday, anticipating a complex and thorough process. Officer Brian Belling confirmed that investigative measures, including interviews, surveillance, and various other steps, had already been undertaken.

The Carnation Revolution, also referred to as the 25th of April, marked a significant turning point in Portuguese history. Taking place on April 25, 1974, in Lisbon, it was a military coup led by officers aiming to dismantle the authoritarian Estado Novo regime. This pivotal event instigated profound changes across Portugal and its colonies, encompassing social, economic, territorial, demographic, and political spheres through the ongoing Revolutionary Process. At its core, the revolution catalyzed Portugal's transition to democracy, bringing an end to the Portuguese Colonial War. Initially orchestrated by the Armed Forces Movement (MFA), a coalition of dissenting military personnel, the coup quickly garnered civilian support, leading to a widespread civil resistance movement. The revolution ushered in negotiations with African independence movements, resulting in significant geopolitical shifts. By the close of 1974, Portuguese troops withdrew from Portuguese Guinea, subsequently recognized as Guinea-Bissau by the United Nations. This domino effect continued with the independence of Cape Verde, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Angola in Africa, alongside East Timor's declaration of independence in Southeast Asia. These seismic events prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from the African territories, predominantly from Angola and Mozambique, culminating in the return of over a million Portuguese nationals – the retornados. The moniker "Carnation Revolution" stems from its remarkably peaceful nature, with minimal violence and an emblematic gesture of offering carnations to soldiers by Celeste Caeiro, a restaurant worker. This symbolic act was embraced by the jubilant populace, who flooded the streets to celebrate the downfall of dictatorship. Carnations soon adorned the muzzles of guns and soldiers' uniforms, embodying the spirit of peaceful resistance. Today, April 25th holds profound significance in Portugal, observed as a national holiday known as Freedom Day (Dia da Liberdade), commemorating the ideals and achievements of the Carnation Revolution.

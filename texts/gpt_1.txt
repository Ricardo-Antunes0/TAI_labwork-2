A prolonged bout of severe thunderstorms is currently wreaking havoc across the central US, unleashing damaging wind gusts, large hail, and tornadoes. The peril posed by these relentless storms is expected to intensify over the coming weekend. The turbulent weather commenced on Thursday in the Plains, unleashing at least two confirmed tornadoes along with numerous reports of hail, some as large as baseballs, and wind gusts reaching up to 70 mph. This atmospheric onslaught aligns perfectly with the classic springtime conditions conducive to severe weather. Moisture laden air from the Gulf of Mexico is streaming into the central US, while escalating temperatures are further fueling the storm activity. Several regions are bracing for an extended period of severe weather spanning two to three consecutive days. Cities such as Dallas, Kansas City, Des Moines, and Omaha are among those facing the potential onslaught of multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms through Sunday.

Pop music emerged as a dominant force in the musical landscape during the mid-1950s, originating in the United States and the United Kingdom. Initially synonymous with rock and roll and its youthful influence during the 1950s and 1960s, pop music underwent a transformation in the late 1960s. It evolved into a distinct genre characterized by its commercial appeal, fleeting nature, and widespread accessibility. Key features of pop music include recurring choruses and catchy hooks, typically found in songs of moderate length following a basic verse-chorus structure. The rhythmic elements of pop music are often designed for easy dancing. Moreover, pop music frequently incorporates elements from various genres such as rock, urban, dance, Latin, and country. Although "popular music" and "pop music" are frequently used interchangeably, the former term encompasses a broader range of styles that enjoy widespread popularity. While much of the music that dominates record charts is categorized as pop, the genre itself is discernible from mere chart-topping hits.

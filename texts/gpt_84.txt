Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez made a surprising announcement on Wednesday, declaring that he would suspend his public responsibilities until the following week to contemplate whether to persist as the head of the government. This decision came shortly after a Spanish court disclosed the initiation of an investigation against his wife. Sánchez intends to disclose his resolution regarding his role as prime minister during a press conference scheduled for next Monday. Sánchez, a member of the Socialist Party, revealed that the court had launched the investigation into his wife, Begoña Gómez, following a petition from a far-right organization named "Manos Limpias" (Clean Hands). The inquiry revolves around allegations of influence peddling and corruption in her business ventures. Sánchez affirmed his wife's intention to defend herself vigorously and collaborate with the legal proceedings. The Prime Minister criticized the origins of the complaint, attributing it to what he termed as "right and far-right" digital media outlets. He expressed the necessity to pause and contemplate whether to continue leading the government amidst these developments.

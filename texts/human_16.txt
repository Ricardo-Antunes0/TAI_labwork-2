Manchester United will be targeting a return to winning ways when they face Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park in the Premier League this evening. United were held to a 1-1 draw by Burnley last time out, meaning they have won just two of their last nine league games. As a result of their indifferent form, they were overtaken by Newcastle United and Chelsea in the table over the weekend, with both sides registering emphatic victories. Newcastle beat Burnley 4-1 at Turf Moor on Saturday before Chelsea put West Ham United to the sword 24 hours later, winning 5-0 at Stamford Bridge. Newcastle, who are now sixth, are two points ahead of United, who have dropped to eighth and trail Chelsea on goal difference. United know three points against Palace this evening will see them climb back up to sixth and move one point ahead of Newcastle. However, the Reds will have to win away from home in the league for the first time in more than two months to achieve that ambition. Elsewhere, United are continuing to be linked with a collection of names ahead of the transfer window opening.

Famed for its Algarve coast's sandy beaches, sweeping bays and crystal-clear waters, Portugal is one of Europe's favorite vacation destinations. But there's plenty more to this Iberian country than enjoying the balmy weather. In the north, pretty Porto is home to spectacular churches and stunning architecture, not to mention delicious wine available in countless bars from the nearby Douro valley. The latter is ripe for exploration for those on longer trips, its terraced vineyards and charming villages perfect for whiling away a few days. The capital, Lisbon, retains an old-world charm, but has reinvented itself in recent years as a foodie hotspot, with first-class markets, hip rooftop hangouts and excellent street food.

One day after breaking the championship record in their heat, the US mixed 4x400m team did it again in the final, winning in 3:10.73 – the fastest ever time outside of a global championships. Matthew Boling gave the team an early lead on the first leg, then handed over to Lynna Irby-Jackson. She maintained pole position, but Lieke Klaver of the Netherlands and Rhasidat Adeleke both made up ground, the latter running a sensational 48.45 split – the fastest ever recorded at the World Relays. Willington Wright gave the USA a bit more breathing room on the third leg, then he handed over to Kendall Ellis who anchored the team to victory. Behind her, Femke Bol held off a strong challenge from Ireland’s Sharlene Mawdsley to take second place in 3:11.45, 0.08 ahead of Ireland. Nigeria just missed the podium but was rewarded with an African record of 3:12.87. At the start of the evening’s programme, The Bahamas won their heat in Olympic qualifying round two and smashed their national record in the process with 3:12.81 – a time that would have placed them fourth in the final, had they qualified. The difference in running order played a big part in their success. This time Steven Gardiner gave the team an early lead, while his fellow Olympic champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo brought the team home, splitting 49.54. Germany (3:13.85) and Great Britain & NI (3:12.99) won the other heats, while Jamaica, Switzerland and Ukraine claimed the remaining Olympic qualifying places as the runners-up across the three heats. World and Olympic 200m medallist Gabby Thomas proved to be USA’s most valuable asset this evening. Just 20 minutes after running a leg on their victorious 4x100m team, Thomas was back on track for the 4x400m final. Not content to simply coast around, Thomas received the baton from Quanera Hayes and blasted a 49.58 split – the fastest of the US team – before handing over to Bailey Lear. Alexis Holmes, who anchored USA to gold in the mixed 4x400m at last year’s World Championships, once again ran a superb last leg here (49.63) to cross the line first in 3:21.70 – the second-fastest time ever at the World Relays. In the scrap for positions behind USA, Natalia Kaczmarek ran a strong leg (49.46) to carry Poland to second place in 3:24.71. Canada, who have finished fourth at the past three global championships, this time made it into the top three, finishing third in 3:25.17. Great Britain & NI placed fourth in 3:25.84, more than a second ahead of Norway who were rewarded with a national record of 3:26.88. Just 90 minutes prior, six more places for the Paris 2024 Games had been claimed in the Olympic qualifying round two. Jamaica – who surprisingly missed out on making the final – won the first heat in 3:28.54 with India taking second place. The Netherlands, world champions indoors and out but missing their two strongest sprinters in this discipline, managed to take the second heat in 3:27.45 as Switzerland followed them home. And Belgium were victorious in the third and final heat, winning in 3:26.79 as Spain broke a long-standing national record to claim second spot in 3:27.30. Little more than eight months ago, Botswana found themselves disqualified from the men’s 4x400m at the World Athletics Championships Budapest 23 for a changeover outside the zone. Here in Nassau, however, they dominated the final to win by 1.64 seconds in a world-leading 2:59.11, becoming the first African nation to win a men’s sprint relay at the World Relays. Italy was ahead at the first exchange, thanks to a strong opening leg from Luca Sito. But Botswana’s Busang Collen Kebinatshipi ran well before handing over to world 100m silver medallist Letsile Tebogo. The versatile sprinter uncorked a 43.72 split to put Botswana into the lead, a position that Leungo Scotch maintained on the third leg. Behind him, South Africa was locked in battle with Japan and world indoor champions Belgium. Bayapo Ndori took up the running for Botswana on the final leg, producing a 44.13 split to carry them to victory in 2:59.11. Lythe Pillay managed to pull ahead of Belgium’s Jonathan Sacoor to give South Africa the runner-up spot in 3:00.75. Belgium crossed the line third in 3:01.16, just ahead of Japan (3:01.20). USA were conspicuous in their absence from the final. They had been disqualified from their heat on Saturday for moving out of the assigned order at one of the changeovers. It meant they had to be content with racing in Olympic qualifying round two, and they duly won their heat in 2:59.95. India was a distant runner-up in 3:03.23. Spain won the second heat in 3:02.39, beating Poland (3:02.91). And Brazil claimed victory in the third and final heat in 3:01.86 from Trinidad & Tobago (3:02.39), who finished just 0.05 ahead of world silver medallists France. It was particularly bittersweet for the Olympic host nation as they were missing one of their key athletes, Thomas Jordier, who pulled up injured in the heats on Saturday. And as France’s only medallists at last year’s World Championships, expectations were high heading into this Olympic season. Nevertheless, they – and all other countries who missed out on securing an Olympic berth – will still have a chance of making it to the Games. Two places remain in each relay discipline, which will be given to the top nations based on performances achieved within the qualifying window.

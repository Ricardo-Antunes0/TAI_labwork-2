Formed in London in 1997, Coldplay is a British rock band comprising vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, lead guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, drummer Will Champion, and manager Phil Harvey. Renowned for their dynamic live shows and cultural influence, they first crossed paths at University College London, originally under the monikers Big Fat Noises and Starfish before adopting their current name. Following the independent release of "Safety" in 1998, Coldplay inked a deal with Parlophone in 1999 and crafted their debut album, "Parachutes" (2000), featuring the breakout hit "Yellow" which clinched a Brit Award for British Album of the Year and a Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album. Their subsequent album, "A Rush of Blood to the Head" (2002), garnered similar acclaim, followed by "X&Y" (2005) which marked the culmination of what they deemed a trilogy, earning a nomination for Best Rock Album. Their next effort, "Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends" (2008), not only secured these accolades but also became the top-selling album of its year, reigning over charts in over 30 nations. Its titular track made history as the first British single in the 21st century to lead both the Billboard Hot 100 and UK Singles Chart simultaneously. In subsequent releases, Coldplay ventured into diverse genres including electronica, R&B, ambient, disco, funk, gospel, blues, and progressive rock with albums like "Mylo Xyloto" (2011), "Ghost Stories" (2014), "A Head Full of Dreams" (2015), "Everyday Life" (2019), and "Music of the Spheres" (2021). Beyond music, the band is deeply engaged in philanthropy, politics, and activism, donating a portion of their earnings to charity and endorsing various humanitarian causes. In 2018, a retrospective film directed by Mat Whitecross hit cinemas to celebrate their two-decade career milestone. With over 100 million albums sold worldwide, Coldplay ranks among the best-selling music acts in history. They've been recognized by Fuse as the sixth-most awarded group ever, boasting the most Brit Award wins by a band. Their impact extends to the charts, with three of the UK's top-selling albums and a record for the most number-one albums in the country without a miss (nine). "My Universe" (2021) catapulted them to the summit of the Billboard Hot 100, making them the first British group to achieve this feat. Additionally, Coldplay boasts two of the highest-grossing tours in history and is hailed by the British Phonographic Industry as one of the planet's most influential and pioneering acts. Their legacy is cemented in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's "200 Definitive Albums" list for "A Rush of Blood to the Head" and their inclusion of "Yellow" in the "Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll" exhibit. Forbes recognized them as the standard-bearers of the alternative scene in 2022, while Time acknowledged their significant contributions as climate action leaders worldwide.

Rock music, born as "rock and roll" in the late 1940s and early 1950s in the United States, has evolved into a diverse genre encompassing various styles since the mid-1960s, particularly in the U.S. and the U.K. Rooted in the blues, rhythm and blues, and country music of the 1940s and 1950s, it also incorporates elements from electric blues, folk, jazz, and other genres. Typically centered around the electric guitar, rock bands usually include electric bass guitar, drums, and vocals. While traditionally structured with a verseâ€“chorus form, rock's diversity is vast, addressing themes ranging from romantic love to social and political issues. Rock's popularity surged from the 1950s to the 2010s, with the mid-1960s seeing a shift towards albums over singles, led by influential bands like the Beatles. This period also witnessed the emergence of distinct subgenres such as blues rock, folk rock, and psychedelic rock. The 1970s brought forth punk rock, characterized by its raw, socially conscious energy, which influenced subsequent genres like new wave and post-punk. The 1990s saw alternative rock rise to prominence with subgenres like grunge, Britpop, and indie rock dominating the mainstream. Fusion genres like pop-punk and rap rock emerged, while the 2000s witnessed a revival of garage rock and post-punk. Although rock's dominance waned in the 2010s due to the rise of hip-hop and electronic dance music, it remains commercially viable. Rock music has not only reflected but also shaped cultural and social movements, spawning subcultures like mods, rockers, hippies, punks, and emos. It has been a platform for political activism and has challenged societal norms on race, sex, and drug use, often symbolizing youth rebellion against conformity. Despite accusations of commercialism, rock music continues to evolve and resonate with audiences worldwide.

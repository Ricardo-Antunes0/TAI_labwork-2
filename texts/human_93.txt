Red Bull has launched an independent investigation into its Formula One team principal Christian Horner over claims he engaged in inappropriate behavior with an unidentified member of Red Bull Racing - allegations the racing chief has denied. “After being made aware of certain recent allegations, the company launched an independent investigation (into Christian Horner),” Red Bull said in a statement, obtained by CNN contributor Phil Duncan, an F1 correspondent with Press Association in London. “This process, which is already underway, is being carried out by an external specialist barrister. The company takes these matters extremely seriously and the investigation will be completed as soon as practically possible. It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time,” reads the statement. A story from Dutch news outlet De Telegraaf reported Monday that Horner has been accused of inappropriate behavior and that the behavior was towards a member of Red Bull Racing, according to several unnamed sources. The report doesn’t name the team member or describe the circumstances.

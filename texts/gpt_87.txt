Alan Fisher, an Irish chef, has surpassed Nigeria's Hilda Effiong Bassey to claim the Guinness World Record for the longest cooking marathon, as announced by the GWR committee on Tuesday. Fisher achieved this feat by cooking continuously for an astonishing 119 hours and 57 minutes at his restaurant in Japan, breaking Bassey's previous record set in May. Bassey, also known as Hilda Baci on social media, gained widespread recognition in Nigeria after her record-breaking cookathon, lasting 93 hours and 11 minutes, captured the nation's attention. Such was the popularity of Bassey's achievement that it caused the GWR website to crash for two days due to the overwhelming influx of traffic from her devoted fanbase, according to the organization.

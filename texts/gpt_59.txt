Afonso was born to Theresa, the illegitimate daughter of King Alfonso VI of León, and her husband, Henry of Burgundy. He was the youngest of four siblings, with his eldest sister being Urraca Henriques. Historically, it was widely believed that Afonso was born in Guimarães, the primary political center of his parents. However, in 1990, Torquato de Sousa Soares proposed Coimbra as his birthplace, sparking controversy and debate among historians. Despite alternative theories suggesting Viseu or even Sahagún as potential birthplaces, it remains widely accepted that Afonso was indeed born in Guimarães. The location of Afonso's baptism is also disputed. While tradition points to the Church of São Miguel do Castelo in Guimarães, doubts arise due to the church's consecration date. Some argue that his baptism may have occurred in the Cathedral of Braga, politically aligning with his father's aspirations by having the highest-ranking clergy perform the ceremony. After his father's death in 1112, Theresa ruled Portugal alone, eventually proclaiming herself queen with the backing of Pope Paschal II. However, her reign faced challenges, including opposition from her half-sister Urraca of León. The identity of Afonso's tutor is debated, with some attributing it to Egas Moniz de Ribadouro, while others suggest it was Egas' older brother, Ermígio Moniz. In his early years, Afonso faced exile by his mother in 1120, but upon reaching adulthood at fourteen, he took matters into his own hands and became a knight in 1125. Following a military campaign against his mother in 1127, Afonso revolted and seized control of the county, setting the stage for his eventual ascension as the first King of Portugal.

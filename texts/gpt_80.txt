A dire warning has been issued by a UN agency regarding the escalating crisis in Darfur, located in western Sudan, where time is rapidly running out to avert widespread starvation. According to the regional director for Eastern Africa of the World Food Programme (WFP), people in Darfur have resorted to consuming "grass and peanut shells" due to the dire lack of food. Without urgent assistance, the region faces the grim prospect of mass starvation and loss of life, emphasized Michael Dunford. Sudan has been engulfed in a civil war since April 2023, marked by intense violence between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The conflict has rapidly deteriorated, characterized by horrifying reports of sexual violence, genocidal acts, and civilian casualties, leading to a mass displacement of refugees. Tragically, the situation took a deadly turn on Thursday when gunmen attacked a convoy of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in South Darfur. The attack resulted in the tragic deaths of two ICRC drivers, with three other staff members sustaining injuries. The ICRC team was en route to assess the urgent humanitarian needs of communities affected by the ongoing armed violence in the region, highlighting the perilous conditions faced by aid workers attempting to provide assistance in the midst of conflict.

Red Bull has initiated an independent investigation into allegations against its Formula One team principal, Christian Horner, concerning purported inappropriate conduct with an undisclosed member of the Red Bull Racing team. Horner has refuted these allegations. In a statement obtained by CNN contributor Phil Duncan, a Press Association F1 correspondent in London, Red Bull confirmed the investigation's launch, noting it is being conducted by an external specialist barrister. The company emphasized the gravity of the matter and stated that the investigation will be conducted expeditiously. Further comments were deemed inappropriate at this time. Reports from Dutch news outlet De Telegraaf suggested that Horner had been accused of misconduct toward a member of the Red Bull Racing team, according to multiple anonymous sources. However, the report did not identify the team member or provide details on the alleged incident.

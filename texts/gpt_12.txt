Meta's social media platform, Facebook, emerged in 2004 through the efforts of Mark Zuckerberg and his Harvard College peers Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. Originally limited to Harvard, it swiftly broadened its reach across North American campuses. By 2006, its doors were open to users as young as 13 in most regions, 14 in select countries. With nearly 3 billion monthly active users as of December 2022, Facebook stands as a global giant, ranking as the third most frequented website worldwide by October 2023, with a notable portion of its traffic originating from the United States. Mobile users embraced it, making it the most downloaded app of the 2010s. Accessible across devices, users craft profiles, share multimedia, and connect with others through friend networks or public posts. Messenger facilitates direct communication, while interest groups and friend activities keep users engaged. Despite its popularity, Facebook hasn't been immune to controversy. Criticisms range from privacy breaches, exemplified by the Cambridge Analytica scandal, to accusations of political influence and fostering negative psychological impacts. Content controversies, spanning from fake news to hate speech, have marred its reputation, with critics highlighting concerns about its handling of such issues and its pursuit of advertiser appeal.

Canadian actor Ryan Thomas Gosling, born on November 12, 1980, has left an indelible mark on both independent cinema and major studio productions, with his films collectively amassing over $2 billion worldwide. His talent has garnered him numerous accolades, including a Golden Globe Award, and nominations for three Academy Awards and two British Academy Film Awards. Gosling first captured attention at the age of 13 on Disney Channel's The Mickey Mouse Club (1993â€“1995), before venturing into other family-oriented shows like Are You Afraid of the Dark? (1995) and Goosebumps (1996). However, it was his portrayal of a Jewish neo-Nazi in The Believer (2001) that marked a turning point in his career, leading to stardom with the 2004 romantic drama The Notebook. Gosling has since delivered acclaimed performances in independent films such as Half Nelson (2006), which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, Lars and the Real Girl (2007), and Blue Valentine (2010). In 2011, he showcased his versatility with successes in various genres, starring in the romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love, the political drama The Ides of March, and the action thriller Drive. Gosling expanded his horizons by making his directorial debut with Lost River (2014), and continued to impress audiences with roles in The Big Short (2015), The Nice Guys (2016), and the romantic musical La La Land (2016), the latter of which earned him a Golden Globe and his second Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. He further solidified his status with memorable performances in Blade Runner 2049 (2017) and the biopic First Man (2018). In 2023, Gosling starred as Ken in the fantasy comedy Barbie, his highest-grossing release to date, which earned him another Academy Award nomination, this time for Best Supporting Actor. Beyond acting, Gosling is a musician, being part of the band Dead Man's Bones, which released their debut album in 2009 and toured North America. He also co-owns Tagine, a Moroccan restaurant in Beverly Hills, California. Additionally, he is known for his philanthropic endeavors, supporting organizations like PETA, Invisible Children, and the Enough Project, and advocating for peace in Africa, where he has been involved in awareness-raising efforts for over a decade. Gosling shares his life with actress Eva Mendes, with whom he has two daughters.

Detroit, situated in the U.S. state of Michigan, stands as its most populous city. Positioned as the largest city on the United States–Canada border, it serves as the governmental hub of Wayne County. According to the 2020 census, Detroit boasted a population of 639,111, securing its place as the 29th most populous city in the nation. The broader Metro Detroit area, housing 4.3 million residents, ranks as the second-largest in the Midwest, trailing only the Chicago metropolitan area, and the 14th largest in the United States. Renowned for its rich cultural heritage, Detroit has made significant contributions to music, art, architecture, and design, alongside its iconic automotive legacy. Established in 1701 by Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac and Alphonse de Tonty, who founded Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit, the city evolved into a vital industrial center during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, becoming a key player in the Great Lakes region. By 1920, it stood as the nation's fourth-largest city, following New York City, Chicago, and Philadelphia, buoyed by the burgeoning automotive industry. The Detroit River emerged as a global commercial nexus, facilitating the transportation of over 65 million tons of goods annually. However, the mid-20th century ushered in a period of urban decline, marked by industrial shifts, job losses in the auto sector, and rapid suburbanization. Since its peak population of 1.85 million in 1950, Detroit has experienced a precipitous decline, losing over 65 percent of its residents. Despite facing economic challenges, Detroit rebounded from bankruptcy, filed in 2013 and resolved in 2014, to maintain its status as a pivotal port city along the Detroit River. Anchoring the Midwest's second-largest regional economy and the nation's 14th largest, Detroit remains synonymous with the U.S. automotive industry, hosting the headquarters of major players like General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis North America (Chrysler). The Detroit Metropolitan Airport stands as a crucial aviation hub, while the city's connection with Windsor, its Canadian counterpart, forms the second-busiest international crossing in North America. Detroit's vibrant cultural scene, highlighted by its musical contributions such as Motown and techno, has left an indelible mark both locally and globally. The city's architectural splendor, accrued during its heyday, has been the focus of conservation efforts since the 2000s, leading to the preservation of numerous historic landmarks and the revitalization of key areas. Embracing its resurgence, Detroit has become an increasingly popular tourist destination, attracting 16 million visitors annually. Its commitment to design excellence earned it the title of "City of Design" by UNESCO in 2015, making it the first U.S. city to receive such recognition. In 2022, Time magazine recognized Detroit as one of the fifty World's Greatest Places to explore, further cementing its status as a destination of global significance.

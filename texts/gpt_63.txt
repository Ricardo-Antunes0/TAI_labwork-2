In October 2023, President Mahamat Déby, the incumbent, opted to prolong the transition period by an additional two years. Contrary to his prior assertions of not seeking to inherit his father's presidency, he now declared his eligibility to run for a full term. Amidst this political maneuvering, Chad's security forces violently suppressed protests, resulting in the deaths of at least 128 individuals, with hundreds more detained. Tensions escalated further following the announcement of the election date on February 28, 2024. Clashes erupted in the capital, N'Djamena, following government claims that supporters of the opposition Socialist Party without Borders (PSF) had launched attacks on the headquarters of the National State Security Agency (ANSE) and attempted to assassinate Samir Adam Annour, the head of the Supreme Court. Subsequently, government forces besieged the PSF headquarters, resulting in several casualties, including the death of PSF leader Yaya Dillo Djérou, who was Deby's cousin and a prominent presidential candidate. Authorities alleged that the confrontation resulted from a shootout. These violent incidents drew condemnation from the African Union, while French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, Jean-Yves Le Drian, called for an impartial investigation. In a subsequent development on April 12, 2024, the United Chad party lodged a complaint against Mahamat Déby's United Chad coalition, accusing it of plagiarism.

Shrek, a franchise by DreamWorks Animation, draws inspiration from William Steig's 1990 book of the same name. Centered on the adventures of Shrek, an initially grumpy yet kind-hearted ogre, the series unfolds as he embarks on a reluctant journey to rescue a princess. Along the way, he forms unlikely friendships and navigates through a whimsical fairy tale realm. The franchise comprises four animated films: Shrek (2001), Shrek 2 (2004), Shrek the Third (2007), and Shrek Forever After (2010). Additionally, a 4-D short film, originally a theme park attraction titled Shrek 4-D, premiered in 2003. Television specials like the Christmas-themed Shrek the Halls (2007) and the Halloween-centric Scared Shrekless (2010) further expanded the franchise. Spin-off films featuring the swashbuckling feline Puss in Boots, including 2011's Puss in Boots and its sequel, The Last Wish (2022), contributed to the franchise's breadth. Moreover, a successful stage musical adaptation graced Broadway from 2008 to 2010. Praised by The New York Times for its vibrant characters, the Shrek series achieved remarkable financial success, ranking among the top-grossing film franchises worldwide and securing its place as one of the most beloved animated franchises in history.

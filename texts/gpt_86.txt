Analysts highlight the Indian Navy's recent rescue of a commercial ship from pirates off Somalia's coast as evidence of Delhi's formidable special forces capabilities, which rival some of the world's best. The operation, lasting nearly two days, resulted in the safe retrieval of 17 crew members from the vessel MV Ruen, with no reported casualties, according to an Indian Navy news release. Dozens of pirates were apprehended during the operation. The rescue effort showcased a coordinated approach involving a navy destroyer, a patrol ship, an Indian Air Force C-17 transporter flying over 1,500 miles to deploy marine commandos, along with a naval drone, reconnaissance drone, and a P-8 surveillance jet, as detailed in the release. John Bradford, an International Affairs fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, praised the operation, stating that it underscores the Indian Navy's excellence in training, command, and control, among other capabilities. He emphasized the operation's effectiveness in minimizing risks through the strategic deployment of a diverse range of assets, including warships, drones, fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, and marine commandos.

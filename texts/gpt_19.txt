A human rights watchdog has raised alarms about China's propagation of digital authoritarianism beyond its borders, facilitated by its expansive tech industry and large-scale infrastructure endeavors. This exportation of its model, the watchdog warns, is influencing neighboring nations like Cambodia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, offering a blueprint of "best practices." China's "Digital Silk Road" initiative, launched in 2015 alongside its Belt and Road project, aims to extend digital infrastructure like submarine cables, satellites, and 5G connectivity. However, according to Article 19, a UK-based human rights group, the project goes beyond mere infrastructure development. It serves as a vehicle for promoting China's tech industry and reshaping global internet governance norms towards a model of censorship and surveillance. The report highlights the symbiotic relationship between the Chinese state and its tech sector, with companies like Huawei, ZTE, and Alibaba acting as proxies for the Communist Party. China has inked numerous technical agreements with Belt and Road participants, while countries such as Cambodia, Indonesia, and Nepal have engaged in further collaboration with Beijing on digital infrastructure. The Asia Pacific region is of particular strategic importance to China in its quest to normalize authoritarian internet governance. Some countries, like Cambodia, have emulated China's digital governance, with plans to establish a "National Internet Gateway" akin to China's "Great Firewall." Concerns have been raised regarding the impact on privacy, free expression, and economic activity. Additionally, there are worries about Chinese tech companies' handling of data and their potential collaboration with authoritarian regimes. In response, there has been a push in the US and other democracies to address security concerns related to Chinese tech companies like Huawei and ZTE. These concerns extend to issues of data privacy and censorship, given these companies' control over significant portions of global internet traffic. Without greater transparency and oversight, the watchdog warns, there is a risk that China may exploit its influence over digital infrastructure for its own strategic interests or those of allied authoritarian governments.

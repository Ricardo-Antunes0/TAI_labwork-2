Picture it: A spare concert ticket comes your way, leading to a chance encounter with an internationally renowned pop star. When performing at one of the most famous music festivals in the world, they stare past the blinding stage lights into the crowd to lock eyes with you. What transpires, naturally, is a whirlwind romance on the European leg of their sold out tour. It’s a fantasy that — in some variation or another — has captured the human imagination for decades. Films such as “What Price Hollywood” and “A Star is Born” first dabbled in the idea of famous and non-famous relations almost 100 years ago. By 1999, the genre had reached new heights after the release of “Notting Hill” — the seminal Richard Curtis film which saw Julia Roberts, a graceful American movie star, fall for Hugh Grant, a bumbling British bookstore owner. Even more recently, “Starstruck,” the coincidental title of both a 2010 Disney Channel original movie and a 2021 BBC Three series, brought the agony and ecstasy of dating an A-lister as a mere member of the public to the small screen. Now, director Michael Showalter breathes new life into the trope with “The Idea of You,” out on Amazon Prime May 2. Based on the 2017 Robinne Lee novel by the same name, Showalter’s version is set in LA — the birthplace of lofty pipe dreams — starring both Anne Hathaway as Solène Marchand, a glamorous 40-year-old art gallery owner and divorced mother of one; and Nicholas Galitzine as 24-year-old Hayes Campbell, the fan favorite of fictional boy band du jour, August Moon.

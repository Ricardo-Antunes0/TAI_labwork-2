A multi-day severe thunderstorm event is underway as the central US endures damaging wind gusts, large hail and tornadoes, and the danger posed by these fierce storms will only increase into the weekend. Damaging storms Thursday in the Plains kicked off the event and produced at least two confirmed tornadoes, dozens of hail reports – some of which were bigger than baseballs – and wind gusts up to 70 mph. It’s all part of classic springtime setup for severe weather. Moist air from the Gulf of Mexico is flowing into the central US as heat builds in the region, priming the atmosphere for robust storms. Some locations are facing down a severe thunderstorm threat spanning two or three consecutive days. Dallas; Kansas City, Missouri; Des Moines, Iowa; and Omaha, Nebraska, are just a few cities that could be hit by multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms through Sunday.

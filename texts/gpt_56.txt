Hobbits, a fictional race created by J.R.R. Tolkien, are diminutive beings portrayed as roughly half the height of an average human. Described as a branch of humanity or closely related to it, they are also occasionally referred to as halflings in Tolkien's works. Living primarily in cozy underground dwellings nestled into hillsides or other natural formations, hobbits typically go barefoot, with tough, leathery soles on their feet and curly hair covering the tops. The first introduction of hobbits came in Tolkien's 1937 children's novel "The Hobbit," where the titular character, Bilbo Baggins, embarks on an unexpected adventure involving a dragon. In "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, hobbits such as Frodo Baggins, Sam Gamgee, Pippin Took, and Merry Brandybuck take center stage, playing pivotal roles in the fight against evil to save their world, known as Middle-earth. Within Middle-earth, hobbits primarily inhabit the pastoral region known as the Shire, centered around the town of Hobbiton. Some hobbits also reside in Bree-land to the east, where they coexist with Men. The exact origins of the name "Hobbits" have been subject to debate, with potential literary influences including works like Sinclair Lewis's "Babbitt" and Edward Wyke Smith's "The Marvellous Land of Snergs." Tolkien himself refuted any connection to the word "rabbit" and stressed the humanity of hobbits, although some evidence suggests otherwise. In Tolkien's universe, hobbits represent a more modern and relatable aspect compared to the heroic ancient cultures of Gondor and Rohan. Their familiarity with everyday items like umbrellas, matches, and clocks serves to bridge the gap between readers' contemporary world and the fantastical realm of Middle-earth. The term "halflings" has been adopted in other fantasy contexts, notably in Dungeons & Dragons, due to legal considerations regarding the use of the term "Hobbits." Numerous fantasy authors have incorporated hobbit-like characters into their own works, carrying on the legacy of Tolkien's beloved creations.

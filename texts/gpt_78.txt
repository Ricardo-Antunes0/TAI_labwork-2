"In 2024, interior designer Steven Thomas expressed his disappointment with the lackluster state of the British retail scene. With a wealth of experience, having spearheaded the iconic design of the 1970s London fashion haven, Big Biba, Thomas understands the essence of generating excitement. Big Biba, a visionary concept crafted by fashion illustrator Barbara Hulanicki and her former marketing executive husband, Stephen Fitz-Simon, was a meticulously curated destination unlike any other. Opening its doors in September 1973, this seven-floor Art Deco marvel situated on Kensington High Street boasted extravagant features such as a soup stand inspired by Andy Warhol, a rooftop garden inhabited by real flamingos and penguins, and the renowned celebrity hotspot, the "Rainbow Room." Reflecting on the allure of the Rainbow Room, Thomas reminisced in a CNN interview, "Because the Rainbow Room looked the way it did, it didnâ€™t take long for the glitterati to latch on; it was very much a place to be seen dining." Originally designed by architect Marcel Hennequet in 1933 and named after its vibrant, multi-colored ceiling, the dining establishment exuded an air of exclusivity, attracting luminaries such as David Bowie, Mick Jagger, and Bryan Ferry."

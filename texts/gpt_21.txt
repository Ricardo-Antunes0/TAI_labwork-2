ABSTRACT As genomic sequencing and resequencing data proliferate at a pace surpassing the expansion of storage and communication resources, a significant shift in research budgets has occurred, allocating more funds to computational aspects. Efficient storage of this data has thus become crucial. This paper presents GReEn (Genome Resequencing Encoding), a tool for compressing genome resequencing data using a reference genome sequence. GReEn addresses limitations of existing tools like GRS, offering faster run times and achieving compression gains of over 100-fold for certain sequences. The tool is freely available for non-commercial use at ftp://ftp.ieeta.pt/ap/codecs/GReEn1.tar.gz. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, numerous algorithms inspired by the Biocompress approach of Grumbach and Tahi have been proposed for compressing genomic sequences. While these algorithms have contributed to our understanding of genome structure through probabilistic models, the demand for effective storage space reduction remains paramount. Among these algorithms, XM, proposed by Cao et al., has been notably successful, utilizing a mixture of experts to provide probability estimates fed into an arithmetic encoder. Despite the prevalence of standard compression methods like gzip or bzip2, the rapid production of genomic data now outpaces storage resources and bandwidth. This is driven by advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies, leading to initiatives such as the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas, fostering the era of individual genomics and personalized medicine. GReEn stands out as a compression tool that efficiently handles genome resequencing data using a reference genome sequence. Unlike existing tools like GRS or RLZ, GReEn demonstrates superior performance in storage space requirements and running times. Built on arithmetic coding, GReEn accommodates arbitrary alphabets and achieves compression gains of over 100-fold for certain sequences, surpassing the capabilities of GRS and RLZ. Notably, GReEn can handle sequences that are incompressible with GRS due to significant differences from the reference sequence.

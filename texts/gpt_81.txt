In 2019, Xi Jinping's visit to Italy was marked by grand receptions, including private tours of Rome's landmarks and a dinner serenaded by opera maestro Andrea Bocelli. The pinnacle of the visit was Italy's decision to join Xi's ambitious Belt and Road infrastructure project. Fast forward five years, and Xi returns to Europe amidst a vastly altered landscape. Touching down in France, Xi's six-day tour retains ceremonial flair, yet Europe's stance on China has undergone a seismic shift since his last visit. Recent weeks have seen the European Union initiate trade investigations into China's wind turbines and medical equipment procurement, while conducting raids on offices of Chinese security firm Nuctech for subsidy-related inquiries. Moreover, Germany and the United Kingdom have arrested or charged individuals for alleged espionage linked to China. Notably, Italy's formal exit from the Belt and Road initiative dealt a significant blow to China's global strategy. These developments are fueled by mounting economic grievances and apprehensions about China's geopolitical aspirations, particularly its alignment with Russia amid the Ukraine conflict. While some European capitals view China as a multifaceted threat, divisions persist on the urgency and extent of addressing these concerns, both economically and in terms of security. Xi's tour, spanning France, Serbia, and Hungary, presents an opportunity to mend fences with critics and emphasize China's positive engagement. Beijing seeks to temper Europe's push for trade rectifications, which could impact its economy adversely. Moreover, it aims to prevent Europe from aligning too closely with the United States, particularly amidst uncertainties surrounding the upcoming US elections. Yet, significant breakthroughs with Europe's staunchest critics may prove elusive without unexpected concessions from Xi. Instead, the trip may underscore not only rifts between Europe and China but also internal divisions within Europe that could play into China's hands.

Australian police reported a tragic incident at a bustling shopping mall in Sydney, where six individuals lost their lives and several others sustained injuries, including a nine-month-old infant, in a mass stabbing. The authorities were alerted to the situation at Westfield Bondi Junction on Saturday afternoon local time, responding to reports of multiple stabbing victims. Witnesses recounted scenes of chaos and fear, with some seeking refuge in nearby shops as the violence unfolded. Karen Webb, the police commissioner of New South Wales (NSW), confirmed the grim toll, stating that four women and a man succumbed to their injuries at the shopping mall, while another woman passed away later in the hospital. Currently, eight individuals are receiving medical treatment for their injuries in hospitals across Sydney, with the nine-month-old infant undergoing surgery. The lone suspect, who acted independently, was fatally shot by a lone officer at the scene. Assistant Commissioner Anthony Cooke revealed that a senior police inspector was the first to confront the attacker and discharged her firearm when he brandished a knife at her. While authorities have not identified a terrorism motive at this stage, Commissioner Webb emphasized that the investigation will continue for an extended period. She disclosed that the suspect is believed to be a 40-year-old man, but further identification details are pending background checks. A law enforcement source revealed that the suspect had no previous contact with Australian counterterrorism agencies but had a prior encounter with New South Wales Police related to mental health concerns.

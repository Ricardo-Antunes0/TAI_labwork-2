Portugal, officially known as the Portuguese Republic, occupies a strategic position on the Iberian Peninsula in Southwestern Europe. Its territory extends to include the Macaronesian archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira, showcasing the country's diverse geographical features. Portugal boasts the westernmost point in continental Europe and shares extensive borders with the North Atlantic Ocean to the west and south, while the Portugal-Spain border in the north and east is the longest uninterrupted border-line within the European Union. The country is organized into autonomous regions, with the mainland dominated by the vast Alentejo region, characterized by a relatively low population density compared to other European regions. Lisbon, the capital and largest city, serves as a vibrant hub for tourists, along with Porto and Algarve. Portugal's rich history traces back to ancient times, with Celtic and Iberian peoples, including the Lusitanians and Gallaecians, shaping its early culture. Over the centuries, the territory witnessed the influence of Phoenicians, Greeks, and Carthaginians before being ruled by Romans, followed by Germanic peoples, Alans, and Moors. The Reconquista marked the expulsion of the Moors, leading to the establishment of the Kingdom of Portugal in 1143. During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal emerged as a global maritime power, establishing a vast empire that contributed significantly to its economic and political influence. However, subsequent events such as the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, and Brazil's independence in 1822 precipitated a decline in Portugal's fortunes. The 20th century witnessed significant upheavals, including the overthrow of the monarchy in 1910 and subsequent periods of authoritarian rule. The Carnation Revolution in 1974 marked the restoration of democracy and the end of colonial rule, reshaping Portugal's political landscape. Today, Portugal stands as a developed country with a thriving economy, particularly in tourism and infrastructure. Its cultural and linguistic influence extends globally, with approximately 250 million Portuguese speakers worldwide. As a member of various international organizations, including the United Nations, European Union, and NATO, Portugal continues to play a significant role in shaping global affairs.

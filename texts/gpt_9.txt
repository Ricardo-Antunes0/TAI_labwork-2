Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy, born on January 25, 1978, is a Ukrainian statesman and former actor who assumed office as the sixth president of Ukraine in 2019. Raised in Kryvyi Rih within the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast of central Ukraine, he hails from a Ukrainian Jewish background and was initially a fluent Russian speaker. Before venturing into acting, Zelenskyy earned a degree in law from Kyiv National Economic University. Transitioning to comedy, he founded the production company Kvartal 95, known for its diverse portfolio ranging from films to television series like "Servant of the People," wherein Zelenskyy portrayed a fictional Ukrainian president. The show, aired from 2015 to 2019, gained substantial popularity, leading to the formation of a political party bearing its name in March 2018, spearheaded by members of Kvartal 95. Zelenskyy announced his presidential bid on the eve of December 31, 2018, during then-President Petro Poroshenko's New Year's Eve address on 1+1 TV channel. Despite being a political novice, he swiftly emerged as a leading contender in pre-election surveys. Securing victory with 73.23 percent of the vote in the runoff, he campaigned on platforms opposing establishment politics and corruption. Embracing e-governance and advocating for unity among both Ukrainian and Russian-speaking demographics, Zelenskyy has leveraged social media, notably Instagram, for effective communication. Following his inauguration, his party achieved a landslide triumph in a snap legislative election. Zelenskyy's initial tenure witnessed the removal of parliamentary immunity, managing the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing economic challenges, and some strides in anti-corruption efforts. Pledging to resolve Ukraine's protracted conflict with Russia, he pursued dialogue with President Vladimir Putin, though tensions escalated in 2021, leading to a full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022. During the preceding military buildup, Zelenskyy prioritized pacifying Ukrainian citizens and ensuring international assurance of Ukraine's defensive stance. He later declared martial law nationwide and initiated a general mobilization of the armed forces. Zelenskyy's resolute leadership amid the invasion garnered global recognition, culminating in his selection as Time Person of the Year for 2022.

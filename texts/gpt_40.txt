La La Land, released in 2016, is an American musical romantic drama film helmed by Damien Chazelle. Set in Los Angeles, it follows the journey of a struggling jazz pianist (played by Ryan Gosling) and an aspiring actress (portrayed by Emma Stone) who cross paths, sparking a love story as they chase their dreams. The ensemble cast also features John Legend, Rosemarie DeWitt, Finn Wittrock, and J.K. Simmons. Chazelle, inspired by his passion for musicals from his days as a drummer, conceived the idea for the film with Justin Hurwitz during their time at Harvard University. Despite initial challenges in securing financing due to resistance to alter his vision, Chazelle found support after the success of his previous film, "Whiplash" (2014), with Summit Entertainment picking up the project. Initially, Miles Teller and Emma Watson were considered for the lead roles, but ultimately, Gosling and Stone were cast. Filming took place in Los Angeles over August and September 2015, with Hurwitz composing the score and writing songs alongside lyricists Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, and Mandy Moore handling the dance choreography. "La La Land" premiered at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival in August 2016 before its theatrical release in the United States in December, distributed by Lionsgate. The film achieved significant commercial success, grossing $447 million worldwide against a budget of $30 million. It garnered widespread critical acclaim, praised for Chazelle's direction and screenplay, the performances of Gosling and Stone, the score, musical numbers, cinematography, visual style, costumes, and production design. The film received numerous awards and nominations, including a record seven wins at the 74th Golden Globe Awards and eleven nominations at the 70th British Academy Film Awards, where it won five, including Best Film. It also tied the record for most nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, winning in six categories, with Chazelle becoming the youngest winner for Best Director at age 32. "La La Land" has since been celebrated as one of the standout films of the 2010s and the 21st century, earning its place as one of the greatest musical and romantic films of all time. Plans for a stage musical adaptation are underway.

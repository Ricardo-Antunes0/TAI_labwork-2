Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, asserted on Monday that the United States should cease funding the United Nations if it votes in favor of granting full UN membership to the Palestinian Authority (PA). Erdan's statement, released days before Friday's General Assembly meeting, emphasized that endorsing a resolution bestowing state status and rights upon the PA contradicts the principles outlined in the UN Charter. He anticipates that if such a resolution passes, the US would halt its funding to the UN and its affiliated bodies, citing American legislation. Erdan criticized the PA's approach, accusing them of exploiting the UN's majority and ethical decline. He highlighted their failure to secure member state status through the Security Council, prompting them to circumvent established procedures and bring the matter to the General Assembly instead. Additionally, Erdan contended that the proposed resolution, if adopted, would not alter the situation on the ground but would rather demonstrate the UN's detachment from reality and its tendency to reward terrorism. Friday's General Assembly session follows the US's veto of a Security Council resolution in April that sought to recognize a Palestinian state. Meanwhile, images from eastern Rafah depict residents evacuating with their belongings via various means, including cars, trucks, mule-drawn carts, and on foot. This mass exodus was prompted by the Israeli military's directive for civilians to "evacuate immediately." The evacuation order came shortly after the country's defense minister cautioned troops in Gaza to brace for "intense action" in Rafah in the near future. Approximately 100,000 people are affected by the current evacuation. Flyers dropped by the Israeli military warned residents of Rafah Camp, Brazil Camp, and the neighborhoods of Al-Shabura and Al-Zohour that remaining in these areas would endanger their lives. While the purpose of the evacuation order remains unclear, Rafah has become a focal point of the conflict. Over the course of nearly seven months of war, over 1 million Palestinians have sought refuge in Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped following Israel's extensive destruction of the strip's northern region.

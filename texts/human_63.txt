In October 2023, incumbent President Mahamat Déby extended the transition period for another two years. Despite previously declaring that he was not intending to succeed his father, this time he also declared that he was eligible for election for a full term. Chad's security forces gunned down at least 128 protesting people in a day and arrested hundreds more.Following the announcement of the election date on 28 February 2024, clashes broke out in the capital N'Djamena after the government said that supporters of the opposition Socialist Party without Borders (PSF) attacked the headquarters of the National State Security Agency (ANSE), and attempted to assassinate the head of the Supreme Court, Samir Adam Annour. Government forces subsequently laid siege to PSF headquarters, resulting in several deaths, including that of PSF leader Yaya Dillo Djérou, Deby's cousin who had announced his intention to run for president and was regarded as his main opponent, in what authorities said was a shootout.The attacks were condemned by the African Union, while French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian called for an impartial investigation into the incident. On 12 April 2024 the United Chad party filed a complaint against the United Chad coalition of Mahamat Deby, accusing it of plagiarism.

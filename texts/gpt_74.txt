In a nation renowned for its towering skyscrapers, contemporary architecture, and vast desert landscapes, wildlife often takes a back seat in the public's perception of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). However, Dubai-based photographer Anish Karingattil is on a mission to shift that narrative. Originally hailing from India, Karingattil relocated to Dubai 17 years ago and soon immersed himself in wildlife photography, particularly focusing on macro photography, which captures intricate details through extreme close-ups. His impressive portfolio showcases the diverse fauna found across the seven Emirates, featuring captivating images such as a scorpion with its offspring, an Arabian horned viper camouflaged in desert sands, and dew-covered black and yellow mud daubers. "Photography enables storytellers to convey narratives through visuals," Karingattil explains. "Macro photography offers me a fresh perspective on life and the surrounding world." Despite the UAE's arid climate and rugged terrain, the region hosts a rich biodiversity, boasting over 1,000 plant and animal species. Its coastal waters are home to the world's largest concentration of Indian Ocean humpback dolphins and the second-largest population of dugongs globally, after Australia. Aligned with the UAE's commitment to sustainability, Karingattil leverages wildlife photography to document the nation's ecological diversity and raise awareness. While he pursues interior design professionally, "herping" – the study and photography of reptiles and amphibians in their natural habitats – remains his true passion. "Herping allows enthusiasts and photographers to marvel at the beauty and diversity of these creatures," he explains. Photographing potentially hazardous species like snakes and spiders demands meticulous preparation. Karingattil emphasizes the importance of researching animal behavior, habitat, and potential risks to ensure safe encounters that prioritize both the photographer's safety and the well-being of the subject. For Karingattil, conservation lies at the heart of wildlife photography, serving as a potent advocacy tool. "By capturing the allure and vulnerability of the natural world, photographers can urge policymakers and the public to recognize the importance of environmental preservation and sustainable practices," he asserts. Through his social media platforms, boasting over 69,000 followers on Instagram, Karingattil endeavors to educate and inspire others about the species he encounters, fostering a deeper appreciation for the UAE's wildlife treasures.

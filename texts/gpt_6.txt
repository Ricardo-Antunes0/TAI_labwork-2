The top tier of Portuguese football, officially titled Liga Portugal Betclic due to sponsorship, is known as the Primeira Liga. Managed by Liga Portugal, it consists of 18 teams since the 2014–15 season. Three teams at the bottom are relegated to Liga Portugal 2, replaced by the top three non-reserve teams from there. Established in 1934 as Campeonato da Liga da Primeira Divisão, it underwent name changes, becoming Campeonato Nacional da Primeira Divisão until 1999, when it adopted its current title. While over 70 teams have participated, only five have clinched the championship. Dominated by the "Big Three" – Benfica (38 wins), Porto (30), and Sporting CP (20) – the Primeira Liga has seen two other victors: Belenenses (1945–46) and Boavista (2000–01). Its prestige has risen, ranking sixth among UEFA's national leagues as of 2021. In the 2011–12 season, it surpassed the French Ligue 1, entering the top five for the first time since 1990. Additionally, it reached fourth place in the IFFHS's 2011 global ranking.

The 2023–24 North American winter was the warmest winter on record across the contiguous United States, with below-average snowfall primarily in the Upper Midwest and parts of the Northeastern United States. However, some areas, especially in the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York saw considerably more snow than the previous winter. Notable winter events were also more prevalent across the eastern half of the country this winter, including a series of winter storms in mid-January that brought snow from the South to Northeast states, a period of very cold temperatures across much of the country in mid-to-late January, and a disruptive nor'easter that affected much of the Mid-Atlantic in mid-February. 2 storms have been rated so far on the Regional Snowfall Index (RSI), although none have attained a "Major" rating (Category 3+). A strong El Niño was expected to influence the winter weather patterns across the continent. Based on the astronomical definition, winter began at the winter solstice, which occurred on December 21, 2023, and ended at the spring equinox on March 19, 2024. Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter started on December 1 and the last day was February 29. However, winter storms may occur outside of these limits.

Formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987, Nirvana emerged as a quintessential American rock band. Lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain, alongside bassist Krist Novoselic, laid its foundation. Through various drummers, notably Chad Channing, they found stability with Dave Grohl in 1990. Nirvana spearheaded the rise of alternative rock, earning the label of Generation X's musical emblem. Despite a brief stint in the mainstream lasting only three years, their music endures, leaving an indelible mark on contemporary rock culture. Entering the scene amidst Seattle's grunge movement of the late 1980s, Nirvana's debut album, "Bleach," dropped in 1989 under the indie label Sub Pop. Their signature sound juxtaposed quiet verses with thunderous choruses, setting them apart. A pivotal moment came with their major label debut on DGC Records in 1991, as "Smells Like Teen Spirit" from their sophomore album "Nevermind" exploded into mainstream success, disrupting the reign of hair metal.  "Nevermind" achieved Diamond certification and reshaped the musical landscape of the 1990s. Combining punk ethos with pop sensibilities and themes of societal disconnection, Nirvana captured global attention. Their third studio album, "In Utero" (1993), solidified their stature, topping charts and earning critical acclaim. Tragically, Cobain's untimely death in 1994 marked the end of Nirvana, but not their legacy. Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, continued to oversee posthumous releases. The poignant "MTV Unplugged in New York" (1994) earned a Grammy for Best Alternative Music Performance. Nirvana's impact transcends their brief time in the limelight, with over 75 million records sold worldwide. Their accolades include American Music, Brit, and Grammy Awards, along with numerous MTV Video Music and NME Awards. They dominated the Billboard charts with five number-one hits on the Alternative Songs chart and four number-one albums on the Billboard 200. In recognition of their enduring influence, Rolling Stone hailed Nirvana as one of the greatest artists of all time in 2004. Their legacy was further cemented with induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, their first year of eligibility.

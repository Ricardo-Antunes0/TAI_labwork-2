Joaquín Archivaldo Guzmán Loera, born on April 4, 1957, commonly known as "El Chapo" and "JGL," is a former Mexican drug lord and prominent figure within the Sinaloa Cartel, a notorious international crime syndicate. Renowned as one of the most influential drug traffickers globally, Guzmán emerged from humble beginnings in Sinaloa, raised in a poverty-stricken farming family. Enduring severe abuse from his father, Guzmán found himself drawn into the drug trade, initially assisting with the cultivation of marijuana for local dealers during his early adulthood. By the late 1970s, he collaborated with Héctor Luis Palma Salazar, a rising figure in Mexico's drug underworld, aiding in the establishment of drug routes through Sinaloa into the United States. Following Salazar's arrest, Guzmán assumed control, founding his own cartel in 1988. Under Guzmán's leadership, the cartel flourished, orchestrating the mass production, smuggling, and distribution of cocaine, methamphetamine, marijuana, and heroin into the United States and Europe. Utilizing innovative tactics such as distribution cells and extensive tunnels along borders, Guzmán revolutionized drug trafficking, establishing himself as the most prolific trafficker in history. His reign as a drug lord brought immense wealth and power, earning him recognition by Forbes as one of the world's most influential individuals from 2009 to 2013. Despite his capture in 1993 and subsequent imprisonment in Mexico, Guzmán orchestrated daring escapes, evading capture and continuing his illicit operations. A high-profile manhunt ensued, culminating in his arrest in 2014 and extradition to the United States in 2017. In 2019, Guzmán faced trial in the U.S., where he was found guilty of numerous charges related to his leadership of the Sinaloa Cartel. He received a life sentence and is currently incarcerated in ADX Florence, Colorado, United States, marking the end of an era for one of the most infamous figures in the history of drug trafficking.

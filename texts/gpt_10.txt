The NBA, a premier professional basketball league, boasts 30 teams across North America, with 29 in the United States and 1 in Canada. Established on June 6, 1946, in New York City as the Basketball Association of America (BAA), it later became the National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, following a merger with the National Basketball League (NBL). In 1976, another significant merger occurred with the American Basketball Association (ABA), integrating four franchises into the NBA. The NBA season typically spans from October to April, featuring 82 games per team, followed by an extensive playoff tournament culminating in the NBA Finals championship series, often stretching into June. Notably, NBA players have the highest average annual salaries among athletes globally as of 2020. Operating under the umbrella of USA Basketball (USAB), sanctioned by the FIBA (International Basketball Federation), the NBA conducts its international and team-related affairs from its headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. Its entertainment and television studios are based in Secaucus, New Jersey. While ranking third in revenue among North American professional sports leagues, behind the NFL and MLB, the NBA holds a prominent global position, consistently ranking among the top four wealthiest sports leagues worldwide. The Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers share the record for the most NBA championships, with 17 titles each. Currently, the Denver Nuggets reign as the league champions, clinching victory over the Miami Heat in the 2023 NBA Finals.

The winter of 2023–24 marked a historic milestone as the warmest on record across the contiguous United States. Despite below-average snowfall in the Upper Midwest and parts of the Northeast, regions like Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York experienced notably higher snow accumulation compared to the previous winter. Throughout the season, the eastern half of the country witnessed several significant winter events, including a series of mid-January storms that blanketed the South to Northeast states with snow, followed by a period of frigid temperatures in late January and a disruptive nor'easter in mid-February. While two storms have been rated on the Regional Snowfall Index (RSI), none reached a "Major" rating (Category 3+). The influence of a strong El Niño was anticipated to shape winter weather patterns across the continent. By the astronomical definition, winter began with the winter solstice on December 21, 2023, and concluded with the spring equinox on March 19, 2024. However, according to the meteorological definition, winter spanned from December 1 to February 29. It's worth noting that winter storms may occur beyond these delineated periods.

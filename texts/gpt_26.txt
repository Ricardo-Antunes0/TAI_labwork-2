Rap, also known as rhyming, flowing, spitting, emceeing, or MCing, stands as an African-American art form rooted in vocal delivery and emotional expression, blending rhyme, rhythmic speech, and often street language. Typically performed over a beat or musical accompaniment, rap encompasses three key elements: "content" (the message or lyrics), "flow" (the rhythm and rhyme), and "delivery" (the cadence and tone). Distinguishing itself from spoken-word poetry by its synchronization with musical beats, rap also differs from singing in its focus on spoken delivery rather than varying pitches. While some rap artists may experiment with vocal qualities like timbre, rap remains a fundamental aspect of hip-hop music, often referred to as "rap music." Its origins trace back to various influences, including the West African griot tradition, vocal styles of blues and jazz, the African-American insult game known as "playing the dozens," and 1960s African-American poetry. Emerging from the Bronx, New York City, in the early 1970s within the hip-hop cultural movement, rap initially evolved from the role of the master of ceremonies (MC) at parties, transitioning into more extended performances over time. Typically, rap is delivered over a beat provided by a DJ, turntablist, or beatboxer, although some artists may choose to perform a cappella. In the studio, producers often provide the beats for MCs to lay down their verses. Stylistically blurring the lines between speech, prose, poetry, and singing, the term "rap" originally meant "to lightly strike" and has evolved to denote rapid speech or verbal exchange. Having roots in British English dating back to the 16th century, the term gained prominence in African American dialects in the 1960s before becoming synonymous with the musical style of hip-hop.

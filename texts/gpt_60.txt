Google LLC, an American multinational corporation and technology juggernaut, is renowned for its prowess in various domains including online advertising, search engine technology, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI). It stands as a behemoth in the global market, celebrated for its market dominance, data prowess, and technological advancements, particularly in the realm of AI. Established on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin during their tenure as PhD students at Stanford University, Google swiftly rose to prominence. Following its initial public offering (IPO) in 2004, Google underwent reorganization in 2015, emerging as a key subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., one of the Big Tech titans alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. Under the leadership of Sundar Pichai, who assumed the role of CEO in 2015 and later took the helm of Alphabet in 2019, Google expanded its repertoire beyond its eponymous search engine. Its product portfolio now encompasses an extensive array of offerings ranging from cloud computing and productivity tools to smart home devices and wearable technology. Despite the proliferation of its product offerings, Google has also seen the discontinuation of certain ventures such as Stadia and Google+. Beyond internet services and consumer electronics, Google delves into cutting-edge ventures including quantum computing, self-driving cars, and smart cities. Its influence extends far beyond cyberspace, with Google and YouTube ranking among the most-visited websites globally. However, Google's dominance has not been without controversy, facing scrutiny over issues like privacy, tax practices, and antitrust concerns. Despite these challenges, Google remains a formidable force in the tech industry, continuously innovating and shaping the digital landscape.

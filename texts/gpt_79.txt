Currently, within the confines of the hall's secure Hixon Gem Vault, stand 17 imposing gems, safeguarded by nightly locking protocols. Additionally, nine ornate jewelry pieces grace the walls outside. Among these treasures, the focal point is the illustrious Jonker I diamond, weighing a remarkable 125 carats. This diamond, steeped in history, has traversed the hands of jewelers, dignitaries, and royalty across the globe. The journey of the Jonker I began with its discovery in South Africa by diamond prospectors in 1934. Legend has it that the unearthing occurred amidst a downpour, revealing a massive 726-carat rough diamond beneath the washed-away sediment. Purchased by Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, it found its way to jeweler Harry Winston in 1935 for Â£150,000, a mere fraction of its eventual value. Transported from South Africa to New York City for a nominal fee of 64 cents, Winston commissioned Lazare Kaplan, renowned for his diamond expertise, to cut the gem into 13 pieces using a tool coated in olive oil and diamond dust. Among these pieces, the Jonker I stood as the largest. In 1948, King Farouk of Egypt became the proud owner of the Jonker I, but his reign over the diamond was short-lived, lasting only four years before his deposition and exile from Egypt. Following these events, the diamond mysteriously disappeared from the annals of history.

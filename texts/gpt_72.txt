Umberto Motto had harbored a lifelong aspiration: to don the revered maroon shirt of Torino FC and grace the Stadio Filadelfia amidst thunderous cheers from devoted fans. As a local lad born in the northern Italian enclave of Turin and the esteemed captain of Torino's youth squad, Motto appeared destined to embody the essence of his beloved hometown club. His long-awaited dream did materialize, albeit under harrowing circumstances that turned what should have been a moment of triumph into a haunting nightmare. On the fateful day of May 4, 1949, Motto found himself giving a tour of Turin to two clients of his parents' textile factory, renowned for crafting shirts for Torino and the Italian national team. The city was blanketed by a thick fog that had persisted for seven consecutive days, compounded by relentless rainfall that caused the river Po to overflow its banks in certain areas. Such adverse weather prompted Motto to alter the sightseeing itinerary, opting instead to ascend Superga hill with his guests, hoping to offer them a memorable vista of Turin despite the fog's obscuring veil. However, conditions atop the hill were even more treacherous, rendering visibility to mere meters and thwarting their intended panoramic view. Returning to Turin, the trio sought solace in a local caf√©, where they commiserated with the proprietor over the uncharacteristically inclement weather. Little did they know, upon their return to the city, they would encounter a scene of unprecedented chaos: congested roads resonating with the cacophony of honking horns. Assuming the commotion to signify positive news, Motto, now 93, vividly recalls the disorienting revelation that awaited him upon reaching Torino FC headquarters. Mario Lanati, the building's caretaker, urgently summoned Motto upstairs, where he received the devastating news that would forever alter the course of his life and the fate of Torino Football Club. Lanati's somber words reverberated through Motto's bewildered mind: "Umberto, you must know... something disastrous has occurred. The plane... it crashed." Stunned and incredulous, Motto's inquiry as to which plane Lanati referred to elicited a response that shattered the very fabric of his reality. The aircraft in question had been transporting nearly the entire Torino first team back from a friendly match in Lisbon, Portugal, when adverse weather conditions tragically culminated in a fatal crash into the slopes of Superga hill. The calamity claimed the lives of 31 individuals, including 18 of Torino's esteemed players, coaches, sports journalists, and flight crew, precipitating one of the most profound tragedies in sporting history. The loss of the renowned 'Grande Torino' squad, on the cusp of securing a fifth consecutive Italian league title, reverberated throughout the city and beyond, leaving an indelible mark on the collective psyche of Turin's populace. Penned by author Roberto Pennino, 'Immortal Torino' chronicles the enduring legacy of the fallen heroes, capturing the profound sense of grief and loss that permeated the city streets. These revered athletes, once ubiquitous fixtures in the fabric of Turin's daily life, left an irreplaceable void, as though countless individuals had lost cherished kin. The catastrophe of Superga serves as a poignant reminder of the fragile interplay between triumph and tragedy, forever enshrining the memory of Torino's fallen heroes in the annals of footballing lore.

Monday night may mark a significant milestone for Boeing's spaceflight program as its Starliner spacecraft is poised to carry two NASA astronauts to orbit. The highly anticipated mission, named the Crew Flight Test, is scheduled for liftoff as early as 10:34 p.m. ET from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. NASA will provide live coverage of the event starting at 6:30 p.m. ET on Monday. This momentous occasion represents a decade-long endeavor by Boeing to develop a spacecraft capable of transporting astronauts to and from the International Space Station as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. Despite challenges such as development delays and test flight issues, Boeing has persisted in its efforts. While Boeing faced setbacks, its competitor under NASA's commercial crew program, SpaceX, emerged as the primary transportation provider for NASA astronauts. However, after rigorous testing and preparations, NASA and Boeing have now deemed the Starliner spacecraft ready for its ultimate trial: carrying astronauts into space. Veteran NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will embark on Monday's mission aboard the Starliner, destined for a weeklong journey to the International Space Station. During their flight, they will conduct various tests, including assuming manual control of the spacecraft momentarily and assessing its functionality for crew operations.
